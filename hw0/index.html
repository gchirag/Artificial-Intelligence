			The person who agreed to talk to the program is a friend of mine, batchmate from the CSE department but hasn't taken the AI course.

			He talked to the program for about 20 minutes and the file size is about 4 kb and of nearly 110 lines. His native language is Hindi.

			He was satisfied with the program and was of the opinion that it could help people with mental problems.

			For some part of the time he said the response was similar to a human response. The following snippets are from that portion:

			On looking at the <b>source code</b>, I would say ELIZA works by simple string parsing and substitution of key words into sentences.
			It first of all makes pre transformation to the sentences, checks for a quit word. Then it scans sentences for keys and builds a key stack, and finally tries to make decompositions for each key.
			During decomposition, it tries to isolate the word's synonyms. Then it reassembles the reply from decomposition and generates the response.
			It also reverts the topic to the initial entries entered by the user, if it can't analyze the sentence completely.

			The concept behind this is that in the near future, if we build perfectly artificially intelligent bots, then they may start behaving like us and maybe even start lying among themselves.... !!
