The CPI (M), which heads the Left Front government in Tripura, has criticised the Railway Budget for “ignoring” the north-east, while the Opposition Congress has termed it progressive and pro-people.

“The budget is very frustrating. It has cheated the people of the north-eastern region,” CPI (M) spokesperson Gautam Das said on Tuesday.

The region got next to nothing as the budget proposed no new project or funds. “We believe that the budget is aimed at the next general election, but it will not work,” he said.
