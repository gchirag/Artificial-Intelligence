 As Jharkhand celebrates Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led Indian victory against Sri Lanka in the ICC Cricket World Cup, the State unit of the Congress has demanded that Bharat Ratna be conferred on him.

“We will write to the Central government to confer the Bharat Ratna on Dhoni,” Jharkhand Congress president Pradeep Balmuch told reporters here on Sunday.

Mr. Balmuch met Dhoni's parents and congratulated them. “India won the T20 World Cup and the World Cup under Dhoni. We feel great to have been associated with Dhoni .We will honour Dhoni when he arrives here,” he said.

Dhoni's parents, however, preferred not to speak to mediapersons.

His brother-in-law Gautam Gupta said: “We have no words to express our happiness.”

Governor M.O.H. Farook and Chief Minister Arjun Munda congratulated Dhoni.
