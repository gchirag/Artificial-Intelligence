 Maintaining that his jailed daughter and party MP Kanimozhi had no role to play in the 2G spectrum allocation scam, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief M. Karunanidhi on Thursday said she was a mere shareholder in Kalaignar TV.

“Kanimozhi has no connection with spectrum allocation. She is just a shareholder in Kalaignar TV. Generally, it is not a practice to file case against shareholders (in such cases),” he told reporters in Chennai.

The 88-year-old DMK patriarch said Ms. Kanimozhi’s advocates had put forth this argument before a CBI court, “but the case continues.” Kalaignar TV, in which Ms. Kanimozhi and Mr. Karunanidhi’s wife Dayalu hold majority shares, is embroiled in a controversy over the transfer of over Rs. 200 crore from DB Realty, owned by scam-accused Shahid Balwa.
