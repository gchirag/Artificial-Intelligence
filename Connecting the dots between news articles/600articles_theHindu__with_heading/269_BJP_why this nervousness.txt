 Sticking to its guns on a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum scam, the BJP on Monday said, “We are still firm on our stand.”

The reaction came soon after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to Public Accounts Committee Chairman Murli Manohar Joshi expressing his readiness to appear before the PAC.

BJP spokesman and MP Shahnawaz Hussain insisted that if the Prime Minister was not responsible for the 2G scam, he should not be apprehensive of forming a Joint Parliamentary Committee. “If somebody is clean, why is this nervousness to face a JPC?”
