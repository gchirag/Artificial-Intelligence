 It may sound strange, but true. The State government has found no evidence of ‘agriculture failure' to be the reason behind farmers suicides in the State since the year 2000.

While furnishing a written reply to a query related to farmers' suicides in the State Assembly on Tuesday, Agriculture Minister Damador Rout said according to State Crime Record Bureau, 2,575 suicidal deaths were reported on farming or agriculture activities between the years 2000 and 2008.

Newspapers had also covered as many as 64 alleged suicides by farmers during 2009-10 and till February 10 of 2010-11, Mr. Rout informed the House. Altogether 2,639 farmers had allegedly committed suicides from the year 2000.

Minister's reply, however, remained silent on the second question that what support the State government extended to families of farmers who had committed suicide.

As per SCRB, between the year 2000 and 2008, more than 250 farmers took extreme steps every year in the State except 2000. From 2002 to 2004, number of such suicides crossed 300 in a year.

Irresponsible statement

“This is an irresponsible statement from the Minister who denied agriculture is reason behind alleged incidences of suicides. It only shows how apathetic the government is towards farmers' welfare,” said Debjit Sarangi of Living Farm, a city-based organisation that works in agriculture sector.

Communist Party of India (M) also ridiculed the claim of the Minister saying “there is every evidence of farmers committing suicide due to agricultural crisis. Many farmers who ended their lives had taken loans from cooperative societies, micro-finance organisations and even from money lenders. They were under pressure to pay back the loan amount.”

“It is unfortunate that the State government resorts to blatant lies on such a sensitive issue. What other proof the government requires to conclude that farmers are committing suicides due to agricultural reasons,” asked Suresh Panigrahi of CPI (M).

Activists said the crop loss due to unseasonal rain in November and December last had also led to spate of farmers' suicides in the State. They expressed shock that the State government found none of those suicides was due to agriculture.

In the reply Agriculture Minister went on to describe that the State government was taking various steps for holistic development of agriculture. He said the budgetary provisions for Agriculture Department had been increased from Rs. 344.58 crore in 2008-09 to Rs. 747.72 crore in 2010-2011. The government was taking steps to increase soil fertility, farm mechanisation and irrigation facilities through borewells in hard-rock areas in 17 districts, he added.
