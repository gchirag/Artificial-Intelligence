NEW DELHI: The Delhi police have reportedly approached Interpol seeking help in tracing Ravinder Kishan Sudan, one of the absconders in the Jessica Lal murder case who had allegedly disposed of the weapon used in committing the crime.

Investigations had earlier revealed that Ravinder had been given the pistol used to gun down Jessica at Tamarind Court restaurant to dispose it of. Before the police would trace him, he had fled the country.

Though the police had later managed to tape his alleged conversation with another person regarding the weapon, they were unable to trace him.

"He is an important link in the entire chain and he can give us ample information to connect the murder weapon with the main accused," said a senior police officer, adding that a response from the Interpol officials was awaited.
