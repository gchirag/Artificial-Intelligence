Refusing to comment on speculation on the timing of the execution of Ajmal Kasab, the BJP said it was “an issue of national importance,” but it had not yet brought closure to the families of the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

Party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman told journalists here on Wednesday: “The people of India wanted to see justice done, particularly the people of Mumbai. The affected families have never had a chance to have closure on this matter, but even now I think that the closure has not happened.” The execution decision “should have been taken long time ago,” but even now “justice is not complete.”
