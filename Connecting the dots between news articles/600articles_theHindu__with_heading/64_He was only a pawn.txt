 Kasab was a jobless youth who was brainwashed into committing the dastardly act by the Lashkar-e-Taiba. He was merely a pawn in the 26/11 terror game. The machinery that despatched and remote-controlled him is still functional in Pakistan, and that is what we want dismantled.

It might seem an irony that the hanging of the man, who became the symbol of the most audacious peacetime assault on India, will weigh minimally on the long-term consequences of his bloody assignment.

Kasab was a foreigner who waged war against a state and its people probably not out of free will but thanks to indoctrination and a delinquent mindset. The killing of a prisoner of war is deplorable.

He should have been handed over to his state and allowed to undergo a free and fair trial under the law and justice delivery system there. We have killed one Kasab; thousands of Kasabs are waiting in and around Punjab, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, and Srinagar.

The circumstances which led to the transformation of a teenaged son of a poor snack vendor to a man trapped in the so-called religious war need to be considered. War against terrorism will succeed only when nowhere in the world are poor children forced to give up their lives for the blind war waged by religious bigots.
