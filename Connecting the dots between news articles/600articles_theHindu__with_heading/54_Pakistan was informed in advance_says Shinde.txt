Union Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde on Wednesday said New Delhi had informed Islamabad in advance about the decision to hang Ajmal Kasab through diplomatic channels but Pakistan refused to acknowledge the letter delivered through courier by the Indian High Commission.

“The External Affairs Ministry, through our mission in Islamabad, had informed the Pakistan government about Kasab’s hanging. When they did not accept the letter, they were communicated through fax,” Mr. Shinde told journalists.

The Indian High Commission also informed Kasab’s family members of his execution. “His family members were communicated through courier by our High Commission. We have the receipt of the courier sent and that was later given to the Maharashtra government,” Home Secretary R.K. Singh said.

Significantly, a few days ago, India refused to host Pakistan’s Interior Minister Rehman Malik for a proposed two-day visit to formalise the new visa regime. Though the government cited Mr. Shinde’s busy schedule ahead of the winter session of Parliament for postponement of the visit, it is now apparent that India wanted to avoid any embarrassment to the visiting dignitary.

Mr. Shinde said India would hand over the body to Pakistan if that country made a claim.
