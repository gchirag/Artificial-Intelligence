The 28-year wait is over. India is now world champion. The team is rightly considered a great batting side. Skipper M.S. Dhoni, by promoting himself up the batting order, not only anchored the run chase but also showcased his ability to perform under pressure. Congratulations Team India, you have made the country proud!

Saturday's memorable win in Mumbai won the hearts of cricketing fans in not only India but across the world. Many cricket fans who were not born in 1983 must be feeling extremely lucky to see India win the World Cup.

After almost 28 years, the most coveted trophy in the cricketing world is ours. The brilliant display of team effort made the feat possible. The lord of cricket, Sachin Tendulkar, had his moment of glory in his sixth World Cup appearance.

As for us, it was a feeling that cannot be described in words. We've shown the world we are the best.


The unsung hero of the day was indeed Gautam Gambhir who was instrumental in bringing the target of 275 within Team India's reach. He deserves special praise for his cool and controlled effort.



Captain “Fantastic” Dhoni deserves praise for displaying nerves of steel and playing a magnificent knock under tremendous pressure. The “Jharkhand dynamite” delivered when it mattered most.

The World Cup triumph is another feather in Dhoni's cap. It will go down in history as the most memorable victory in Indian cricket. Under Dhoni's inspirational captaincy, nothing is impossible for the Men in Blue.
