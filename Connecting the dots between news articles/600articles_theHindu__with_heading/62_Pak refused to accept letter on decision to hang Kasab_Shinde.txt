 India had informed in advance Pakistan and the family members of Ajmal Kasab about the decision to hang the 2008 Mumbai attack terrorist but Islamabad refused to acknowledge the letter, Home Minister Sushilkumar Shinde said today.

“The External Affairs Ministry through our mission in Islamabad had informed the Pakistan government about Kasab’s hanging. When they did not accept the letter, they were communicated through fax,” Mr Shinde told reporters in New Delhi, hours after the hanging of the only captured terrorist in the attack.

Union Home Secretary R K Singh said family members of Kasab, who live in Pakistan, had also been informed by Indian High Commission in Islamabad.

“His family members were communicated through courier by our High Commission. We have the receipt of the courier sent and that was later given to the Maharashtra government,” Mr Singh said.

Kasab was hanged in Pune’s Yerawada jail at 7.30 AM, Maharashtra Home Minister R R Patil said in Mumbai.
