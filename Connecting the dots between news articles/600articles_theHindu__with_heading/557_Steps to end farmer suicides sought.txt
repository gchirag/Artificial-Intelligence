Desheeya Karshaka Samajam has urged the government to take immediate steps to prevent the suicide of farmers in the State.

In a statement here on Saturday, the Samajam general secretary Muthalamthode Mani said N. Vasu, a farmer of Kuthanur Village in the district, committed suicide on Thursday. A debt of Rs.4 lakh from a cooperative bank, which he was finding tough to repay, was said to be the reason behind the suicide. He had two acres of land.

His body was found hanging in a tree in his house compound, the statement said.

This was the second suicide of farmers in the district in the recent time, Mr. Mani said. Apart from Palakkad, there were also farmer suicides reported from Wayanad and other districts. Despite the continuing suicide of farmers, the State government was not taking effective steps to prevent it, he said.
