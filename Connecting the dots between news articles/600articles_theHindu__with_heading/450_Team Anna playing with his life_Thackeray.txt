The Shiv Sena on Friday accused members of Team Anna of “playing” with the social activist's life, for their vested interests and asked them to sit on fast instead.

“[Kiran] Bedi and others have personal disputes with the government, and for these disputes they are playing with Hazare's life,” Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray said in the editorial of the party mouthpiece Saamana.

‘Betrayal of Hazare'

“Though Bedi was in the police department for a long time, no government made her the Delhi Police Commissioner. One should go into the reasons for this,” the editorial said.

“Let [Arvind] Kejriwal, Bedi, [Manish] Sisodiya fast for next 10-12 days, let their bodies feel the brunt of the fast. If these people are going to have meals twice a day and snacks four times a day and still continue with their anti-corruption stir, it would be a betrayal of Hazare,” the Sena chief said.

Mr. Thackeray had recently written to Mr. Hazare appealing him to end his fast.

Mr. Thackeray's grandson Aditya Thackeray met Mr. Hazare in Delhi and conveyed the support of the “whole Shiv Sena family” for his cause.
