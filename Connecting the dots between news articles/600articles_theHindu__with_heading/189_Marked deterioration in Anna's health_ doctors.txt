 Anna Hazare, who has been on a fast for over a week now at the Ramlila Maidan here, has been advised hospitalisation after his health deteriorated on Tuesday.

“Mr. Hazare has been fasting for more than a week now and there has been a marked deterioration in his health. There are also changes in his vital signs which is a matter of concern. We are monitoring his condition carefully,'' said Dr. Naresh Trehan, who is heading the team of doctors attending on Mr. Hazare.

“We have also advised that he be put on intravenous drip, which he isn't willing to go in for before discussing it with his team. He is also insisting on staying with the people at the Ramlila Maidan,'' said Dr. Trehan.

“His glucose level has declined and Mr. Hazare has already lost 5.6 kg since he began his fast on August 16. Traces of ketone was also found in his blood/urine report,'' said a close associate of Anna Hazare on Tuesday.
