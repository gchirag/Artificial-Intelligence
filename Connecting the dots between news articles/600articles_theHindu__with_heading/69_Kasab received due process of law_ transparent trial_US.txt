 Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks who has been hanged to death, received due process of law in a full and transparent trial, the US said today, asserting that it wants to see the terrorists behind 26/11 brought to justice.

“We’ve said before that we welcome steps towards justice in the Mumbai attacks. We’ve said many times before that we want to see the terrorists behind these attacks brought to justice,” State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters in Washington.

“My understanding is that he received due process in a full and transparent trial and the sentence was carried out,” Mr Toner said in response to a question.

The Washington Post also praised the Indian Government for carrying out this execution in secrecy.

“In a country where few things remain secret, where everything is argued in public, and where courts take decades to complete trials, Kasab’s swift hanging was a welcome surprise for many,” the daily said.

25-year-old Kasab was hanged at 7.30 am in the Yerwada central prison in Pune yesterday.
