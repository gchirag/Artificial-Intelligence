 Civil society member on the Lokpal Bill drafting committee Arvind Kejriwal said at a news conference here on Saturday that all the members on the panel were ready for an independent inquiry into allegations against them.

Asked whether Mr. Shanti Bhushan had offered to step down from the panel at Saturday's meeting, he said, “Nothing is going to come out from his leaving the panel. We have offered ourselves to any independent, highest-level inquiry.”

In a veiled criticism of the media, Mr. Kejriwal said nobody had seen the Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CFSL) report on the controversial CD featuring Mr. Shanti Bhushan yet the media was reporting that the CD was allegedly not doctored. “Wasn't it the duty of the media to ask for the CFSL report, whereas Mr. Bhushan has got it verified from the two best labs.”

In its resolve to reach out to people the members launched a website for inviting comments and suggestions. The website, www.lokpalbillconsultation.org is in English and Hindi although the latest version of the Jan Lokpal Bill that has been uploaded is in English as Hindi translation is being readied by the government.

Mr. Kejriwal said people could send their views by email to lokpalbillconsultation@gmail.com or by post to A-119, First Floor, Kaushambi, Ghaziabad.

Jayaprakash Narayan of Loksatta will organise on Sunday a public consultation on the Bill with eminent citizens, former judges and former Chief Election Commissioners.

Convener of the National Alliance of People's Movements Medha Patkar has organised a public consultation here on May 8. Public consultations have also been scheduled here on April 26, 27 and 29.

The next meeting of the joint drafting committee is on May 2 in New Delhi.
