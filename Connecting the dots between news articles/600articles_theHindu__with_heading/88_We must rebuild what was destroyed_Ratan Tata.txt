MUMBAI: Corporate India, already shaken by the global financial meltdown, has reacted cautiously. Ratan Tata, Chairman of Indian Hotels Co. (Taj) and of Tata Sons, said, “The terrible wanton attacks last night on innocent people and the destruction of prominent landmarks in India deserve to be universally condemned. My sympathies and condolences go out to all those who have suffered, been injured, and those who have lost their loved ones in this terrible act of hatred and destruction.

“We cannot replace the lives that have been lost and we will never forget the terrifying events of last night, but we must stand together, shoulder to shoulder as citizens of India, and rebuild what has been destroyed. We must show that we cannot be disabled or destroyed, but that such heinous act will only make us stronger. It is important that we do not allow divisive forces to weaken us. We need to overcome these forces as one strong unified nation.”

According to Anand Mahindra, Vice-Chairman and Managing director, Mahindra & Mahindra, “This attack on Mumbai should, and will be seen as part of a globally coordinated escalation in terrorist activity. The response therefore, needs to be a global one. India must work in tandem with other nations and dramatically enhance its capacity to cope with and indeed prevent such brazen attacks on its nerve centres. In the meantime, Mumbai and its citizens will demonstrate yet again that we refuse to allow our spirit to be subdued by the forces of terror.”
