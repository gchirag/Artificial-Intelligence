Seeking to counter the offensive launched by Rahul Gandhi, Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati on Sunday accused the Congress of trying to divert attention of the people from corruption and price rise with its “drama” and directed her party workers to reach out to people to “expose” the tactics.

Ms. Mayawati, while holding a meeting of party officer bearers, asked them to gear up for the polls due next year and get more people in the party fold and also made some changes in the organisation to improve its functioning.

The Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister directed party workers to reach out to masses and counter opposition propaganda against the BSP

“To divert attention of the people from corruption and price rise, which was a gift of faulty economic policies of UPA government, Congress is involved in enacting ‘natak’ (drama) and people should be made aware about it.

“Had the UPA government accepted the state’s request of providing special economic package of Rs. 80,000 crore, the face of backward Bundelkhand and Poorvanchal would have different,” Ms. Mayawati said in a statement.

Asking party men to remain alert, she said that efforts might be made to vitiate communal atmosphere ahead of assembly polls to gain political mileage.

Ms. Mayawati said her government had taken up development and public interest works, besides controlling crime and maintaining law and order.

Taking on Ms. Mayawati on the land acquisition issue, Rahul Gandhi undertook a four-day foot march from Bhatta village in Greater Noida to Aligarh covering over 70 km by Friday.
