NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to stay the conviction of Vikas Yadav, sentenced to undergo four years' imprisonment in the Jessica Lal murder case.

Vikas Yadav, citing the interim order passed by the apex court in respect of cricketer Navjot Singh Sidhu, prayed for suspension of his conviction to enable him to contest the upcoming Uttar Pradesh Assembly election.

Rejecting the application, a Bench of the Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, Justice P.K. Balasubramanyan and Justice R.V. Raveendran said "there is no question of suspension of conviction".

On the plea for suspension of the sentence the Bench directed that the matter be tagged along with the appeal against the High Court judgment.

The submission of counsel for Vikas Yadav, son of Uttar Pradesh politician D. P. Yadav, that Vikas had already undergone the term of imprisonment did not impress the Court to grant any relief to him.

Additional Solicitor-General Gopal Subramanian and Delhi Police counsel Mukta Gupta opposed Vikas Yadav's plea alleging that he had committed a murder while he was on bail in the Jessica Lal case. They were referring to the Nitish Katara murder case in which Vikas along with his cousin Vishal is facing trial.
