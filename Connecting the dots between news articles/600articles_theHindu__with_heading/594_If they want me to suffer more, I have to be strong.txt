I have already suffered for 20 years and been in jail for 18 months. If they want me to suffer more, I have to be strong,” said actor Sanjay Dutt, reacting to the Supreme Court’s Thursday order sentencing him to undergo five years in jail for possession of arms in connection with the 1993 Mumbai blasts case.

The 53-year-old was heartbroken because “today along with me, my three children and my wife and my family will undergo the punishment. I have always respected the judicial system and will continue to do so, even with tears in my eyes.”

Mr. Dutt said he would complete all his films and not let anyone down because of his sentencing. “I am overwhelmed by the support of my fans, the industry people, the media and all the well-wishers. They have always stood by me and supported me. I know in my heart that I have always been a good human being, respected the system and always been loyal to my country. My family is very emotional right now and I have to be strong for them. I am shattered and in emotional distress. I am sorry I can’t come down and meet you all. God is great and he will guide me through this.”
