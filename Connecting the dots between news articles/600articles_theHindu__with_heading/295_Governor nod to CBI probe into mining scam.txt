Governor Syed Ahmed on Friday recommended CBI inquiry into the alleged irregularities in allotment of coal blocks in the state.

The approval was given by the governor following a request by the state home department as any probe by the CBI in cases related to irregularities needs consent of the state government. The Raj Bhavan's nod gives a free hand to the investigating agency to access documents in the mining department of Jharkhand.

Sources in the Raj Bhavan said after preliminary inquiry and filing 10 FIRs in irregularities in allotment of coal blocks, the CBI had approached the state government for its approval to conduct an in-depth investigation.

"On the request of the CBI, the state home department prepared a report and submitted it for the governor's approval to give the investigating agency access to documents," said a source.

A few days ago, the CBI has conducted raids on offices and residential premises of Rungta Group in connection with the coal block allotment scam.

"The governor after studying the report was convinced that an in-depth inquiry is needed to unearth the scam and gave his approval. Proper inquiry is also needed in the state and most companies named in the FIR by the CBI have Jharkhand connections," said the source.

A senior official in the state home department said most of the coal mining companies operating in the state were involved in irregularities. "In the preliminary report of the CBI, it has become clear the private companies were not adhering to the laws of the land. We hope that once the investigation is done properly it will open Pandora's Box," said a source.

However, the officials did not disclose the name of the companies, operating in Jharkhand, which are under the scanner of the CBI. They also refrained from disclosing the name of the state bureaucrats who are under the investigating agency's lens.
