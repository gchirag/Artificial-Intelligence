Taking a leaf out of his book

Director Vetri Maran has bagged this year's National Award for his “Adukalam”. The film has won awards in a couple of other categories too. And, it all began with a book! Says the director: “As a student of English Literature, I used to read a lot. One book that had quite an impact on me was ‘Roots' by Alex Haley. ‘Adukalam' was inspired by this book. I remember not being able to take my mind off Chicken George, a character from the book, for over a month back then.”

Best foot forward

Saranya Ponvannan is on cloud nine, having bagged the National Award for best actress for her role in “Thenmerkku Paruvakkatru”. “I owe a lot to director Seenu Ramaswamy for this award. I kept asking him questions about village women and their way of life, and he was always very patient. Two aspects in playing that role required a lot of attention — ploughing the fields and walking without footwear. When I saw a rural woman wearing a specific type of footwear, I got a similar pair for my role. Such is the support I got from the team,” says the actor.
