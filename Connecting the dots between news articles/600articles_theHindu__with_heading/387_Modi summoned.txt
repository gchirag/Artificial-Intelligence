 This refers to the report that the Special Investigating Team appointed by the Supreme Court to inquire into the 2002 Gujarat riots has summoned Chief Minister Narendra Modi to appear before it on March 21.

I wish to thank The Hindu for giving it a prominent coverage. I would like to specially thank the newspaper for highlighting the courage and integrity of the investigating officer, R.K. Raghavan. I am happy to know that the family of Ehsan Jaffrey has been heard.

While the SIT's act of summoning Mr. Modi is a welcome first step, it would have been more encouraging had an FIR been filed against him.
