 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated his Bihar counterpart Nitish Kumar on the resounding victory of the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party combine in the Assembly elections.

By giving the National Democratic Alliance another term in office, the people of Bihar proved that the politics of development and progress had come to stay in the country, he said.

Mr. Modi, however, refused to be dragged into any controversy over Mr. Kumar's pre-election stance that he would have no truck with the BJP if it invited the Gujarat Chief Minister for campaigning in Bihar.
