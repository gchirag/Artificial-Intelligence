Udupi: G. Rajashekhar, a writer, said on Saturday that the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat were a blot on the democratic system of the country.

He was speaking at a protest meeting organised by the Udupi district unit of the “Karnataka Forum for Dignity” seeking the arrest of the Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi and dismissal of Gujarat Government consequent to the sting operation by the “Tehelka” magazine into the post-Godhra riots in Gujarat, here.

Mr. Rajashekhar said that there was enough proof to show that the post-Godhra riots were systematically planned and organised. It was not a spontaneous outburst as claimed by the Sangh Parivar.

He said he was not surprised by the recent “Tehelka” expose as these matters had been researched by eminent persons such as Teesta Setalvad and Suresh Hosabet.
