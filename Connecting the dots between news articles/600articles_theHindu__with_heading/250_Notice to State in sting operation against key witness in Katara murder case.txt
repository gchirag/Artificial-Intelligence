NEW DELHI: The fixing of a date for pronouncement of verdict in the six-year-old Nitish Katara murder case was put off further as the trial court issued a notice to the State on Wednesday in connection with a sting operation carried out against key witness Ajay Katara, who allegedly admitted to having lied before the court to favour the prosecution.

Having listed the matter to be taken up before finalising the date, Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur directed the Delhi Government to file its reply on May 19 after considering the pleas of prime accused Vikas Yadav and another accused Sukhdev Pehalwan, who is facing prosecution separately.

Vikas and Sukhdev had sought bringing on record the CD that allegedly contained the damning evidence against Ajay.

They had also sought summoning of witnesses, including the reporter who apparently carried out the sting operation, under Section 311 (court’s power to summon witnesses) of the Criminal Procedure Code.

Requesting the court to allow the pleas, defence counsel G.K. Bharti said the veracity of the CD should be checked as it contained an admission by Ajay about him not being at the place where he had claimed to have seen Nitish alive in the Tata Safari along with Vikas and his cousin and co-accused Vishal Yadav on the fateful night of February 16-17, 2002.

In his testimony, Ajay had told the court that he had seen the victim with the accused in their vehicle at a check-post on the Delhi-Hapur highway around midnight as his scooter had broken down.
