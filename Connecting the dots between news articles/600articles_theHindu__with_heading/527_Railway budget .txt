I wonder whether the new trains and facilities introduced in the Railway budget are all-India projects or all-Congress projects. The budget has ignored the north-east. The backward hill areas of the north-east are in dire need of proper infrastructure. But the Centre has always ignored the interests of the region.

In the olden days, the Railways were run to operational convenience and people adjusted their travel accordingly. But with the increase in the number of States and bifurcation of railway zones, the demand is more and out of bounds. Therefore, it will be highly impossible to provide a satisfactory transport facility for both passenger and freight service. The only solution is integration of railway zones. It will allow for a wide range of discussions and common demands will be met soon.
