CHENNAI: The area around Samiyar Madam at Kodambakkam wore a festive look on Monday. It was celebration time. Autorickshaw drivers were visibly thrilled. Petty shop owners were flaunting their proximity to A.R. Rahman’s house and the studio in the area.

The phone would not stop ringing at the house of Rahman’s younger sister R. Fathima. His little niece and nephew looked all excited. “We feel out of the world today. This is God’s grace,” said Ms. Fathima, who spoke to her mother after the ceremony.

“My mother actually tried calling me up a few times, but I did not know, as I have been giving interviews non-stop,” she says, smiling timidly. “I spoke to her later…she was also extremely happy. She told me ‘Anna’s hard work has paid off.”

Recalling their childhood, she says: “He was glued to music, his passion. Music and his prayers are the two most important things for him. Rahman is just adorable, and I know that everybody will say this about him, not just me.”

“I like Taxi Taxi and Jai Ho,” jumps his nephew Kaashil, even as Amina, his 6-year-old niece, whispers: “Jai Ho is my favourite song!”

Rahane, Rahman’s older sister, remembers how they used to fly kites and play street cricket, but studying was not really his cup of tea. Before his language exam, Rahman’s mother would merely read out passages and he managed to pass.

“If he had studied, I am sure he would have been great at it, but music was his true calling.”

Rahane, who has also sung for him, says: “It was amazing singing for him.” At Rahman’s K.M. Music Conservatory, students and faculty were evidently elated. They greeted each other, saying ‘Jai Ho,’ before beginning a practice session for an upcoming show.

Those at his studio housed below were glued to the television set and celebrated the occasion with special biriyani and sweets. A 20,000-wallah thundered on the streets, and eager neighbours came out to take part in the fun.
