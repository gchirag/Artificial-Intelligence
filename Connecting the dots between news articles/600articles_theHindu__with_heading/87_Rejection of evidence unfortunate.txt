NEW DELHI: India on Wednesday questioned Pakistan’s swift dismissal of the evidence presented to it on the November 26 attacks in Mumbai and termed it a “political rejection without any basis.”

The Ministry of External Affairs said it was “unfortunate” that the Pakistan Foreign Office chose to regress into the previous patterns of denial of facts, evidence and reality. The MEA spokesperson said that on January 5, India gave Pakistan the evidence it had asked for on the Mumbai terror attacks.

“Less than 24 hours later, the Pakistan Foreign Office has chosen to reject this evidence. How can this rejection be credible or be based on a real examination and investigation of the evidence? This is a political rejection without any basis,” the spokesperson said.
