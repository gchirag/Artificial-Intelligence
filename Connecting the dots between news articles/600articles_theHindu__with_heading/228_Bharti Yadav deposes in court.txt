NEW DELHI: Bharti Yadav, a crucial witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, on Wednesday began her deposition in a trial court here. Public prosecutor B.S. Joon examined her for around three hours on various counts of her statement to the police.

The proceedings began at 10-30 a.m. and went on till 1-30 p.m. It, however, remained inconclusive. Mr. Joon will further examine her on Thursday.

Since Mr. Joon is still examining Ms. Bharti, it is understood that the prosecution has not declared her a hostile witness. Except Neelam Katara, mother of deceased Nitish Katara, D.P. Yadav, father of Ms. Bharti, and counsel for the prosecution, defence and Ms. Katara, no other person was present in the court.

Nitish Katara's brother Nitin Katara, a prosecution witness, was made to wait outside. Reporters too were not allowed inside. The content of the evidence recorded was also not made available to them. However, Ravinder Kaur, who is conducting the trial, told reporters that she would make copies of the recorded evidence available to them on conclusion of the proceedings. Ms. Neelam Katara avoided the media when she came out after the proceedings.

Ms. Bharti came to the Patiala House Court much before the scheduled time for the recording of her evidence.She entered the court premises through the gate through which only judges are allowed to enter and exit.

Her vehicle was also parked at the place reserved for judges. She covered her face with a white shawl while exiting from the court. Though police were in large numbers, supporters of Mr. D.P. Yadav pushed and shoved press photographers when they were taking photographs of Ms. Bharti.
