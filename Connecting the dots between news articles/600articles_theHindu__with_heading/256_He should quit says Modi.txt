 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, after the Supreme Court judgment in the 2G scam.

Addressing a public meeting on the conclusion of his one-day “Sadbhavana Mission” fast at Mandvi, he said the court had come out with a “clear” indictment on the largest scam ever in the country.

He said even after the apex court's order to the trial court on Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram, the Congress and the Centre “have come out in the open to save the Minister.” Actually the effort was not to save him but to “protect some very big heads behind the Minister.”
