Indian films have been nominated many times for the Oscar, but never won it. Logical flaws, overdose of emotions and sentiments, poor back ground scores, could be some of the reasons for Indian films losing out to slickly produced big Hollywood movies. But now with ‘Slumdog Millionaire’, an Oscar Award is perhaps well within our reach. One person who can fulfil the dreams of millions of Indians is none other than the ‘Mozart of Madras’ A.R.Rahman. From jingles to global acclaim, the musical wizard Rahman has been unstoppable. His scores in ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ are awesome and mind boggling.
