 The hearing in the Mumbai attacks case in an anti-terror court in Rawalpindi was adjourned on Saturday by a week to December 12.

There were no proceedings at the hearing as the judge was called away for a meeting of all anti-terror court judges summoned by the Chief Justice of Lahore High Court.

Lawyers were on strike in Rawalpindi and rest of Punjab province against the attack on the mosque.
