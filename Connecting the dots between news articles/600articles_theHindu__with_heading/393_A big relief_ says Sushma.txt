Accusing vested interests of targeting Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi for his alleged role in the 2002 riots, the Bharatiya Janata Party said that the Special Investigation Team (SIT) report giving a clear chit to Mr. Modi in the Gulberg Society case “is a big relief.”

Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj tweeted saying, “No evidence against Narendra Modi says the SIT appointed by the Supreme Court. A big relief for us. Ten years of vilification campaign must stop.”

BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad pointed out that the SIT was appointed by the Supreme Court, which had also monitored its investigation into the Gulberg Society case from time to time.

“If media reports that the SIT found no prosecutable evidence against Modi are true, then we are very relieved as an international and national campaign against Modi to somehow frame him for the Gujarat riots was on for the last 10 years,” Mr. Prasad said.
