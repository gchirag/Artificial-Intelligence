 Non-resident Indians from across Britain held a protest here on Saturday to demand justice for the 23-year-old Delhi gang-rape victim, and held a candle-lit vigil in her memory.

In a petition to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, submitted through the Indian High Commission, they called for a stricter law against rapists and the setting up of fast-track courts to deal with sexual assault cases.

They said that as “concerned’’ Indian citizens they were shocked and ashamed by what had happened.

Members of Pravasi Bharat, which had organised the protest, gathered near the statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Tavistock Square and observed a minute’s silence. They carried placards, “Strict law against rapists’’, “Fast-track courts please’’ and “Respect women’’.
