 Putting a lid on the controversy that Bihar BJP leaders were unwelcome in Gujarat, Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday telephoned Bihar BJP president C.P. Thakur and invited him and other leaders to his State to campaign for the party.

“Modiji telephoned me today [on Sunday] to say that unnecessary confusion has been created... all BJP leaders and workers are welcome in Gujarat for the elections,” Mr. Thakur said.

BJP MP and spokesman Shahnawaz Hussain said: “There is nothing like Bihar versus Gujarat in the BJP. We all work together to ensure the victory of the party in elections anywhere in the country.”

Mr. Hussain, a Lok Sabha member from Bhagalpur, said BJP leaders and workers from Bihar would go to Gujarat to defeat the Congress and re-elect a party government there.

Mr. Kumar had protested Mr. Modi’s handling of the 2002 riots, and he was kept away from the Assembly election in Bihar in 2010 and in 2005.
