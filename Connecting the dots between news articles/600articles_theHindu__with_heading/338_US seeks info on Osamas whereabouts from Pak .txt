 Insisting that some elements in the Pakistani government know the whereabouts of al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden, U.S. has said that the information should be shared with it.

“I think what the Secretary (of State) was saying was that it’s our belief that somewhere within the (Pakistani) government there is this kind of knowledge, and we would hope that if that knowledge is available we can find out and take appropriate action,” State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters at his daily news conference.

Mr. Crowley said Secretary of State Hilary Clinton in an interview during her trip to Pakistan did not suggest that the highest level authorities in Pakistan have specific knowledge of where Osama is.

“I think the CIA director recently said on a major television programme it is — he’s not sure precisely today where bin Laden is,” he said.

“I think we believe that he remains in the tribal areas between Afghanistan and Pakistan,” Mr. Crowley said in response to a question.
