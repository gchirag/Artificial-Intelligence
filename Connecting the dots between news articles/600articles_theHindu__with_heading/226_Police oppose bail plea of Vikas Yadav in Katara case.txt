NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Thursday continued to oppose the bail petition of Vikas Yadav, the prime accused in the Nitish Katara murder case.

Mukta Gupta, representing the State, argued that Vikas' conduct after the murder and the CFSL report on the weapons allegedly used by him to kill Nitish Katara did not entitle him to be freed on bail.

Elaborating further, she said that both Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav had absconded after allegedly killing Nitish Katara in February 2002.

Both were arrested from Gwalior on February 23 that year and pistols recovered from them, she said adding that both were going under the assumed names of Rajkumar and Sushil Kumar.

Besides, the CFSL report on the hammer allegedly used by Vikas is incriminating, she said.

Though it was less possible that the hammer may have been used, but however little possible it may be, use of the hammer to kill Nitish can't be ruled out,'' she from cited the report.

Vikas Yadav, son of politician D P Yadav, is facing trial in the case for allegedly kidnapping and latter murdering Nitish Katara, the son of a refused Indian Administrative Service officer, in February 2002.
