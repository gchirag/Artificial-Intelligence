Team Anna members Arvind Kejriwal and Kiran Bedi came under fresh attack on Sunday over allegations of financial malfeasance and using of influence for personal gains.

Their former colleagues, Swami Agnivesh and Rajinder Singh, faulted Kejriwal for having deposited donations for social activist Anna Hazare's agitation in a trust run by him, from which the names of major team members were missing.

Team Anna said Agnivesh might be making such accusations “out of anger” as he was removed from the team after a video clip surfaced, purporting to show him asking a person to deal strongly with Mr. Hazare.
