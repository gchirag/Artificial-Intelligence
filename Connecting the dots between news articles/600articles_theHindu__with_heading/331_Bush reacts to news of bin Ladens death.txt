 Former U.S. President George W. Bush says he has congratulated President Barack Obama after hearing about the death of Osama bin Laden.

In a statement Sunday night, Mr. Bush said Mr. Obama called to tell him that U.S. forces had killed bin Laden.

Mr. Bush said, “This momentous achievement marks a victory for America, for people who seek peace around the world, and for all those who lost loved ones on September 11, 2001.”

He also said the U.S. “has sent an unmistakable message - No matter how long it takes, justice will be done.”
