Germany striker Miroslav Klose appears not to consider retirement after Thursday's Euro 2012 exit and rather sets his sights on the 2014 World Cup in Brazil.

“I will have to think it over but I can imagine playing another two years and doing better in 2014,” Klose said after Germany’s 2-1 semifinal defeat against Italy.

Klose, 34, came on the second-half of the game in Warsaw but failed to improve on his tally of 64 goals, which are just four shy of the national record 68 from 1970s hero Gerd Mueller.

Klose would be 36 if he continues playing until the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. He has played in every big tournament since the 2002 World Cup.
