 The article “In absolving Modi, SIT mixes up Godhra, post-Godhra perpetrators” (May 15) was interesting. The speeches quoted in the article definitely show the grudge Mr. Modi had towards the minorities. But they do not give compelling evidence on the basis of which he can be prosecuted. That's exactly what the SIT has claimed.
The Gujarat riots are in the news again. While the Supreme Court-appointed SIT has said that there is no evidence to prosecute Narendra Modi, the amicus curiae has maintained that he can be proceeded against in connection with the riots. The media and many NGOs claim the SIT report is not correct. The Modiphobia is amusing.
