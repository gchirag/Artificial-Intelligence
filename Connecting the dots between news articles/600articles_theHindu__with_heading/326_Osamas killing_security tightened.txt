The Kerala police have stepped up security following the reported killing of Osama Bin Laden, founding chief of Al-Queda, by the U.S. forces in Pakistan early on Monday.

A senior police official said law enforcing units, including those guarding airports, railway stations and bus stands, had been directed to be vigilant.

The police were prepared to tackle possible demonstrations, in support of or against the killing. So far, no such demonstrations or sticking of posters hailing or condemning the incident had been reported, the official said.
