Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday urged the construction company that sacked the person who threw a chappal at him in Lucknow to re-employ him.

In a letter to the chairman of the company, Mr. Kejriwal said there should be no ill-will against Jitendra Pathak who did what he did under political pressure or misunderstanding.

‘Counter-productive'

“Removing him from service will not serve any purpose. On the contrary, it will be a kind of violence against him and his family.”
