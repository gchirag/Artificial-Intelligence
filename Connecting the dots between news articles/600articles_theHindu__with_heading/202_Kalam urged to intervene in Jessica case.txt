NEW DELHI: The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has written to President A.P.J Abdul Kalam asking him to intervene to ensure a re-trial in the Jessica Lal murder case.

Demanding that a Central Bureau of Intelligence (CBI) enquiry be conducted into the lapses by the police, DCW Chairperson Kiran Walia said that despite senior police officers pointing out that evidence had been tampered with, these discrepancies were not brought to the notice of the court at any stage during the trail.

"Under such circumstances where the role of the police in handling (or mishandling) the case is not very clear, it becomes imperative that the probe be done by a competent agency other than the police," Ms. Walia pointed out.

Copies of the letter have also been sent to Chief Justice of India Y.K Sabharwal and to Home Minister Shivraj Patil.
