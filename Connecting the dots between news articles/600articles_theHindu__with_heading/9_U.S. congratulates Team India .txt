 Americans may have little knowledge about cricket, but on Monday a message of congratulations on behalf of President Barack Obama was conveyed to Sachin Tendulkar and M.S. Dhoni for India's “historic” and “spectacular” World Cup victory.

“On behalf of the people of America and President Barack Obama, we congratulate heartily the Kings of Cricket and the Kings of the World for bringing the Cup after 28 years,” United States Ambassador Timothy J. Roemer said here.

He described the Indian team's victory as a “historic” and “spectacular” feat.

Mr. Roemer congratulated Tendulkar for realising his wish of winning the World Cup for his country.

“We want to congratulate the magnificent decision-making of the Indian captain, Dhoni, who was flawless in exercising great judgment,” the envoy said here after meeting Foreign Secretary Nirupama Rao.

Mr. Roemer said he wanted to visit the India Gate here to witness the mass celebrations over the Indian victory, but was advised against it by his security staff.

Asked about cricket diplomacy between India and Pakistan, he said, “it looks like it had attraction, it had a very optimistic start.”

Hailing the leaders of India and Pakistan for initiating dialogue between the Home Secretaries and with “more talks” scheduled to take place in April, Mr. Roemer said: “You have three things working at once in these talks. You have cricket diplomacy, you have the real substance and engagement on issues, which is critical, and then you have the people-to-people ties. That is something which the U.S. applauds.”

He, however, added that the U.S. “recognises that only India and Pakistan will determine the pace” of dialogue.

The U.S. Ambassador also praised the Indian security forces and police for having “worked hard and tirelessly” to successfully conduct the event.
