 The Delhi Police Crime Branch on Saturday began a probe into the gang rape committed by three Police Control Room (PCR) van policemen a few years ago, a heinous crime that has been mentioned in the Justice Verma Committee report.

An ACP-level officer has been deputed to investigate the matter and talk to the three members of the committee so that the guilty could be punished.

“On the basis of the report, we have deputed an officer to find out what has happened. The probe has started… we are still in the process of going through all the documents available with us and identify certain people. Once that process is completed, we will be able to make a clear headway,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) S.B.S. Tyagi told The Hindu.

Thorough investigation

Taking cognisance of the news item, ‘A gang rape Delhi policemen got away with?’ published by The Hindu, Home Secretary R.K. Singh on Friday told journalists that a thorough investigation would soon be ordered, besides ensuring the safety of the four street-children who were witness to this crime.

“We have got instructions from the Home Ministry to reach to the bottom of the case and not spare anyone involved in this,” a senior Delhi police officer said.

The committee, in its report, highlighted how four trafficked children were witness to a gang rape in which three cops in a PCR van abducted a girl from near a temple and then dumped her in the middle of the night after raping her.

But the committee members did not file a case with the police as they feared for the safety and security of the children.
