CHENNAI: Hours after A.R. Rahman made the country proud at the Oscars, Jai Ho, one of the enchanting numbers in the movie that also bagged an award, echoed in the central prisons of Tamil Nadu.

As the country was celebrating the historic achievement of “Slumdog Millionaire,” a decision was taken to let thousands of inmates lodged in nine central prisons across the State to have a feel of the magical mantra.

Besides the song, some background input on the much-acclaimed film was also played, prison sources said.

“Rahman needs no introduction in prisons. Every morning one of his popular numbers ‘Thai Manne Vanakkam’ is played in all prisons. We play patriotic songs every morning and evening…they like his song,” Director General of Prisons R. Natraj, told The Hindu.

Though satellite channels are not broadcast inside prison campuses, inmates were aware that “Slumdog Millionaire” made it to the Oscars through newspapers.

Screening planned

However, some prisoners had to be told about how the movie won eight Oscar awards, prison sources said.

“Soon after the song was played, the prisoners applauded. We are thinking of screening the movie in central prisons as a special case,” Mr. Natraj added.
