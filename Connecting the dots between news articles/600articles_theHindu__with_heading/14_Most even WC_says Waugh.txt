 Former Australia captain Steve Waugh said that a good performance in the ICC world Cup will prove a “great turnaround” for Pakistan's cricket.

Waugh, who helped Australia to the title win in the 1999 World Cup, said that the tournament will be the “most even” World Cup as the strengths of the competing sides are evenly balanced.
