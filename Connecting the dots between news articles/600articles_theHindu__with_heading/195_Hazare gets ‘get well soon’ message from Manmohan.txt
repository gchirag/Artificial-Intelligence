Anna Hazare, who was hospitalised after his fast, on Tuesday received a ‘Get Well Soon’ message from Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.

Dr. Singh sent the message through an official of his personal staff along with a bouquet of flowers, PMO sources said.

Mr. Hazare was admitted in a hospital in Gurgaon on Sunday after he ended his fast for a strong Lokpal Bill.

Doctors attending on the 74-year-old activist have said his condition is stable and moving towards normalcy.
