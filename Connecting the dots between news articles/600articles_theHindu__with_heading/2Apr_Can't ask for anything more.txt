 “I could see tears coming out of Sachin Tendulkar's eyes. It was a very special moment for him. We won the World Cup for him. Otherwise, his great career would have been incomplete,” said off-spinner R. Ashwin after he arrived in the city on Monday.

Ashwin impressed in the league game against the West Indies at Chepauk and in the quarterfinal versus Australia at Motera.

Remembering the moments soon after India's triumph, he said, “There were emotions flying around. It was an unbelievable feeling. For a few seconds I did not realise what was happening. And to see the people celebrate in such a fashion was wonderful.”

The off-spinner said, “Dhoni is a great captain. He handled things so well. Everything he touches turns to gold. People were saying that I should have been in the eleven in the semifinal and the final but Dhoni was proved right in playing three pacemen. I cannot ask for anything more than a World Cup for India.”

On his best personal moment in the competition, Ashwin said, “It was when I bowled Shane Watson in the quarterfinal. The field was straight and I knew he would look for the slog sweep. The ball turned just enough.”
