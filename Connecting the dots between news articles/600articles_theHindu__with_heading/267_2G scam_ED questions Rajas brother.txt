 Kalia Perumal, brother of former Telecom Minister A. Raja, was on Tuesday questioned for over three hours by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with its probe in the 2G spectrum scam.

Official sources said Mr. Perumal, a businessman, was summoned to the ED office in New Delhi for his statement regarding the financial dealings of some of the firms which he controlled.

Sources said he was quizzed for over three hours during which he also wrote down his statement.

Mr. Perumal has also been questioned by the CBI earlier in connection with their parallel probe into the scam.

The ED along with the CBI had also raided premises of his firms late last year.

Sources said the investigating teams are trying to find out if his companies acted as a front for Mr. Raja’s financial dealings.

The agencies are probing the money trail in the scam.

Though officials were tight-lipped about the line of questioning, sources said, he was asked about financial transactions and his dealings with certain firms.

The ED has registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with the spectrum scam.
