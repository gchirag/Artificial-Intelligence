 The Supreme Court on Wednesday upheld the land acquisition policy of the Uttar Pradesh government for development of projects alongside the Yamuna Expressway connecting the national capital with Agra.

A bench comprising Justices V.S. Sirpurkar and Cyriac Joseph dismissed the appeal filed by some farmers challenging the Allahabad High Court decision which had upheld the policy of the Mayawati government.

The court did not agree with the contention of the farmers that the land was acquired for a private purpose and not for a public purpose.
