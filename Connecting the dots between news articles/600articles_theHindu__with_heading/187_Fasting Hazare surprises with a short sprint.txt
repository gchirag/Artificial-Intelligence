 The 73-year-old Anna Hazare, who is fasting for the past four days, on Friday did a short sprint at the Rajghat taking by surprise a band of policemen escorting him.

Caught unawares by sudden showers, the anti-corruption crusader broke into a run for a short distance with Delhi Police personnel keeping a pace.

In fact, Mr. Hazare could have tripped when a policeman came in his way but the social activist managed to get past him.

Later in his speech at Ramlila Maidan, Mr. Hazare said he has lost three kgs since Tuesday when he began his fast but was getting tremendous energy from the people who were backing him.
