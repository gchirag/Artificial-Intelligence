 Balakrishnan, 62, a dairy farmer, committed suicide by hanging after reportedly inflicting stab injuries on his wife, Kalyani, 52, at their residence at Chayyoth, near Neeleshwaram, on Monday.

The critically injured woman was taken to a hospital in Mangalore where her condition was reported to be ‘stable,’ the police said.

The police, quoting eyewitness, said Balakrishnan stabbed his wife when she returned from a nearby milk cooperative society. The neighbours took her to a hospital in Neeleswaram, from where she was shifted to Mangalore.
