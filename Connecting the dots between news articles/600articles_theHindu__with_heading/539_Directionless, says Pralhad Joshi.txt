Pralhad Joshi, MP, has termed the Railway Budget a static budget that does not have any constructive proposal.

Mr. Joshi said the budget lacked basic measures that were found in earlier budgets and there was nothing that would give direction to the Indian Railways.

“Mr. Bansal has not made any constructive proposal to help the Indian Railways progress,” he said.

Referring to the much awaited Dharwad–Belgaum new railway line, Mr. Joshi said the people of the region had been disappointed again. Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar had announced that the State government would share the cost of the new railway line and also give the required land. However, the proposal was not taken into consideration by the Railway Minister, he said. Mr. Joshi has welcomed the decision to run the Yeshwantpur–Nizamuddin train four days a week. He has also welcomed the decision to start a Hubli–Mumbai Weekly Express.

Although the Railway Minister had said that there was no hike in fares, he had hiked the tatkal reservation fare and ticket cancellation fee.
