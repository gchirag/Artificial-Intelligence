 The Supreme Court’s verdict on the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts will bring solace to Indians in general, and victims and their families in particular. But we should not forget that the bomb blasts were a reaction to the communal riots that followed the Babri Masjid demolition in 1992. The Srikrishna Commission report gave solid evidence of the involvement of the sangh parivar. But nothing has been done to bring to book those responsible for the riots. It is such indifference that is exploited by criminals like Yakub Memon.

The verdict is laudable. But it is sad that it has taken 20 years to come.

Justice Markandey Katju commands tremendous respect for his outspoken and judicious stand on public issues.

That he has appealed to the Maharashtra Governor to pardon actor Sanjay Dutt sentenced to five years in prison for illegal possession of dangerous weapons is unfortunate. We thought everybody was equal before the law.

Contrarians have a problem. They build pressure on themselves to disagree with the world at large, with or without reasons.

Justice Katju is trying to live up to his reputation of a contrarian by saying a person convicted by the highest court of the land should be pardoned.

In the 1950s, Blitz almost made a martyr of Commander Nanavati, accused of murdering businessman Ahuja. I was reminded of this on reading about the fallout of sentencing Sanjay Dutt.

The government has already indicated that the matter would be looked into and an “appropriate” decision taken once the actor made a plea. There seems to be one set of rules for the rich and elite, and another for the rest of the nation.
