 R.K. Raghavan, former CBI Director and chief of the Special Investigation Team which conducted a fresh probe into the burning of a train coach at the Godhra station on February 27, 2002, said Tuesday's "verdict is professionally satisfying.”

“There is, however, no rejoicing if one reckons that 59 persons lost their lives in this incident alone and more than 1,000 as a sequel to the gory happening at the Godhra railway station. The SIT is determined to pursue the cause of justice and would like to ensure that in the remaining cases also justice is rendered to the victims and to the satisfaction of the whole nation,” he told The Hindu.

While congratulating “my team of investigators, I would like to pray for the peace of the souls of all those whose lives were snuffed out in the series of incidents of February-March 2002. The SIT will continue to discharge its duties without fear or favour.”
