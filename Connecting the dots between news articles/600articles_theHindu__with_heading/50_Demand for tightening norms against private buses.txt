 LIC Working Women Coordination Committee condemning the gang-rape of a girl at New Delhi has underlined the dangers of uncontrolled private transportation lacking accountability. The incident proved that allowing private buses with tinted glasses and curtains would lead to atrocities against women, committee convener G. Suryaprabha said in a statement. If it were a public transport bus, the driver would have accountability, she said.

The low conviction rate and deterrent punishment not being given were also reasons for increasing crime against women casting doubts over the safety of those going out for studies or work, she added demanding stringent punishment to those involved in the Delhi rape.
