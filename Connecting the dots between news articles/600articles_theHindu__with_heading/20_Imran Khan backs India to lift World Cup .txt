 Former Pakistan captain Imran Khan feels India is the favourite to win the upcoming World Cup.

Khan, who led Pakistan to a World Cup triumph in 1992, says “India stands the best chance” because of its depth in both batting and bowling.

Conditions are also expected to help India, which plays five of its six league fixtures at home in the 14—nation tournament which begins on Feb. 19.

India will co-host the tournament with Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
