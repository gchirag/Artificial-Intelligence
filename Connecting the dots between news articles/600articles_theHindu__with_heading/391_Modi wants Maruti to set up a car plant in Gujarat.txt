 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has pleaded with the Japanese company Maruti Suzuki to set up a car project in Gujarat.

Speaking after inaugurating Asia’s first Rs 20 crore Driving and Technical Training Institute managed by the Maruti Suzuki at Gajadara village about 20 kms from here today, Modi said that it would be in the interest of the company as it would be cheaper and economically viable to export cars from the Mundra Port in Gujarat to Europe and other countries.

Modi pointed out that at present, Maruti Suzuki’s car plant is located in Haryana and cars manufactured by it, are brought to Mundra port here for exporting.

Setting up a car project in Gujarat will help it save on transportation cost, the CM said.

With the Tatas setting up its Nano car project at Sanand in Gujarat, it is the turn for Maruti to do so and the state government is ready to provide all the facilities, Modi added.

Modi also reminded the company about the Japan Government partnering with the Gujarat Government in hosting the Vibrant Gujarat Summit held in Ahmedabad in January this year.

He said that delegations from various companies and government bodies from Japan visit Gujarat regularly to discuss about their intentions to set up units here and strengthen the relationship between Gujarat and Japan, Modi said.
