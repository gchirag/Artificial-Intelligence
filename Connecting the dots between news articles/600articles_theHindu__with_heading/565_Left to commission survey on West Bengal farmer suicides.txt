With the State Government continuing to deny that all but one of those who committed suicide in different parts of the State over the past months because of agrarian distress were actually farmers, the peasant organisations affiliated to the Left parties have decided to commission a study on these deaths and the farmers' indebtedness.  

To investigate reasons

“We will commission a survey in Bardhaman district where a majority of the farmer suicides have occurred. It will investigate the reasons behind the suicides, the extent to which the farmers are in debt, the nature of the debt – whether it has been taken from banks, co-operatives or money lenders,” Madan Ghosh, president of the West Bengal Provincial Kisan Sabha told journalists here on Sunday. 

While 29 farmer suicides have been reported since the Trinamool Congress-led government came to power, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has denied that there is a crisis. “We have found out that among all those incidents reported there is only one farmer,” Ms. Banerjee had claimed at a function last week.  

While the State leadership of the Congress, which is a constituent of the West Bengal government, has also repeatedly raised the issue of farmer suicides, the Trinamool Congress maintains that the reports are “false propaganda” of the Communist Party of India (Marxist). 

Mr. Ghosh condemned the attempts made by the State Government to deny that farmer suicides are taking place.

As the State Government continues to deny that farmer suicides are occurring at an alarming rate, an independent survey will be carried out to ascertain the facts, Mr. Ghosh said.

He pointed out that the State Government has not only failed the farmers in procuring paddy and ensuring that they receive the minimum support price announced by the Centre, but the implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act is also floundering.
