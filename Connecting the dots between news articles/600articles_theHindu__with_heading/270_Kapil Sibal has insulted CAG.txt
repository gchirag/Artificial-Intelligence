 The 2G spectrum scam is an “established case,” and the statement by Union Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal that there was no loss to the exchequer was not a responsible reply from a Union Minister, CPI State secretary D. Pandian told reporters here on Saturday.

Terming the 2G scam “collective fraud,” Mr. Pandian alleged that Mr. Sibal's statements only revealed the Central government's state of mind in trying to cover up the case.

Mr. Pandian said that Mr. Sibal had only insulted the CAG through his remarks.
