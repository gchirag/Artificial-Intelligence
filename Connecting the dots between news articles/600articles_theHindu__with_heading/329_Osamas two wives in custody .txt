 Two wives and four children of al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden have been taken into custody after he was killed by U.S. special force's commandos in Abbottabad in Pakistan.

Two women and four children, described as Osama's wives and offspring, were taken away from the compound, said local media reports.

However it was not immediately known under whose custody they are currently in.

Pakistani troops have sealed off the compound and blocked all roads leading to it. Local residents said the compound was bought by a man they knew as Arshad Khan, believed to a resident of Charsadda in Khyber—Pakhtunkhwa tribal region.
