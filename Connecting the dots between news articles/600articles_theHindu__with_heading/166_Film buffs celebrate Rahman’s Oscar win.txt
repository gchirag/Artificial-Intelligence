SALEM: Singing the songs composed by film musician A.R. Rahman and distributing sweets, film buffs and college students in the city on Monday went on a celebration-spree when the news about Rahman winning the Oscar for film ‘Slumdog Millionaire’ spread.

Youths were found distributing sweets at various places after exchanging warm handshakes while many shops and establishments had started blaring the film songs composed by the Academy award winner. A few burst crackers too.

The students of Shri Sakthi Kailash Women’s College celebrated the occasion in a different way.

They cut cakes and distributed the same to others. Girls danced to the tunes of the music composer and also sang the songs.

They also carried posters carrying his pictures.

“It is a great moment for India. It is happening here,” said a student with a wide grin.
