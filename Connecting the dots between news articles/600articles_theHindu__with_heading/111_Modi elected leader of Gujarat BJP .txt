 The elected legislators of the Gujarat Bharatiya Janata Party on Tuesday elected Narendra Modi as the leader of the legislature party at a meeting in Gandhinagar, a day before his swearing-in as the Gujarat Chief Minister for the third time in a row.

Mr. Modi credited the party workers for BJP’s electoral victory in the State last week. The Chief Minister asked political pundits to study the working style of the BJP in Gujarat to understand team spirit.

“This victory is not Narendra Modi’s achievement alone, but the outcome of efforts of lakhs of party workers, who remained with the people for 12 years,” he said, in the presence of Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley, who was here as the party’s observer.

Mr. Jaitley also credited the efforts of party workers for the electoral victory and added that the 2012 mandate in Gujarat was because of the State government’s sterling performance.
