Looking at the newsprint and prime television time dedicated to the U.S. presidential elections, I couldn’t help wondering whether the result would really make a difference. Irrespective of who is in power, the U.S. is not likely to deviate even the slightest bit from its well-established policies aimed at world domination. The only group that had huge stakes in the result was that of American corporates who aligned themselves with Mr. Romney or Mr. Obama. For them, the victory of their favourite means benefits of financial kickbacks in the form of new markets or resources, which will be open for exploitation as a result of the U.S. policies.
