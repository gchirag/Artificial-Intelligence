NEW DELHI: Neelam Katara, mother of young Nitish Katara, hailed Wednesday’s verdict in the six-year-old murder case as a “landmark judgment”, while D.P. Yadav, father of prime accused Vikas Yadav and political strongman of Uttar Pradesh, said his son was innocent and had been framed by people who wanted to destroy his political career.

Talking to journalists soon after the court had convicted Vikas Yadav and his cousin and co-accused Vishal Yadav, Ms. Neelam Katara termed it a milestone case. “I believe that the judgment will ensure that no son of any mother would meet the fate of my son,” she said, adding that her faith in the judiciary had been vindicated and strengthened by the verdict.

“I am feeling relieved and am grateful to God,” she said.

Nitin Katara, younger brother of Nitish, gave credit to his mother’s relentless effort for the verdict. “I believe Nitish died for love. He died for freedom of expression. He died for that school of thought in which our generation is allowed to make a choice and stand by it. That belief has been vindicated by this decision,” he said.

Asked why he had stayed away from the trial, Nitin said his mother was the big force fighting for justice and that he did not want to be a distraction for her.

Mr. Yadav said his son and nephew were framed in the case and key prosecution witness Ajay Katara had been won over. “These people [Katara family] are just the front. There are people behind them who have put their money to win over Ajay and get my sons convicted,” he told reporters.
