 New Delhi: The Minorities Commission feels that the Godhra aftermath has left “too deep a wound” and healing has to be “visible” in view of the scars left by the communal violence.

“It is too deep a wound in Gujarat and will take some more time to heal. Healing the situation has to be visible,” the newly-appointed Commission Chairman, Mohammed Shafi Qureshi, told PTI.

Mr. Qureshi, a former Union Minister, said the Commission planned to visit the State, but “does not want to mix it up with elections.” The process of assembly elections is on in Gujarat, where polls are scheduled on December 11 and 16.
