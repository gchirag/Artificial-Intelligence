 Director Rajkumar Gupta of ‘Aamir’ fame says his second film's title may have a stark resemblance to the Jessica Lall murder case, but ‘No One Killed Jessica’ is not based on it.

“The film is not about the murder case. It is inspired by an article from a daily titled 'No One Killed Jessica'. The article came after the accused were let off by the lower courts and then the film goes into a completely different direction,” Mr. Gupta told IANS.

“I’d rather want everyone to wait and see where I take the film. It is not factual, it is fiction,” added the director who has scripted the film himself.

Model Jessica Lall was gunned down in a restaurant in the capital on April 29, 1999, and the convict Manu Sharma is currently in Tihar Jail.

The film is being produced by UTV Motion Pictures and the makers are planning to release it next year.

Reluctant to shed more light on the project, the director said he is “still in the process of casting” for the film.

A resident of Jharkhand, Mr. Gupta worked with Anurag Kashyap on ‘Black Friday’ and ‘No Smoking’ and also wrote the script for ‘Barah Anna’. He came into the limelight with his hard-hitting directorial debut ‘Aamir’.
