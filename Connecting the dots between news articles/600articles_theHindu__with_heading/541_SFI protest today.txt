The Students’ Federation of India has decided to hold demonstrations across the State on Wednesday in protest against the neglect of Kerala in the Railway Budget. An SFI release said here on Tuesday that its State secretariat said the Railway Budget showed that none of Kerala’s demands had found acceptance. It had no proposal for new lines or electrification, the statement added.
