Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal commented on the Upalokayukta issue in a release on Monday: “It is important that persons appointed to crucial posts such as that of Lokayukta and Upalokayukta are those that possess the highest integrity and are acceptable to citizens of the State.

The selection of persons for such posts should be through a legal, transparent and participatory process.”

Expressing concern over the developments in Karnataka, he said, “It is time that the Government of Karnataka and the Governor immediately resolve the deadlock and give the people of Karnataka what they deserve in the form of a strong Lokayukta and Upalokayukta.
