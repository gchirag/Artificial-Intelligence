NEW DELHI: Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday rejected the amendments suggested by the Centre to the Gujarat Control of Organised Crime Bill, saying it would amount to taking away the “teeth and nails” of the legislation. If need be, the Gujarat government would take the Bill back to the Assembly, he said.
