 The VVIP movement, the security arrangements, the late-night rainstorm, nothing could dampen the excitement of the spectators who started to queue up over six hours before the India-Pakistan World Cup cricket match at the PCA stadium on Wednesday.

The euphoric crowd had begun cheering even before the teams reached the stadium. “We started to ask for the tickets a few days before the windows opened. So reaching the stadium a few hours before is nothing,” said a group of youngsters outside the stadium.

What did they plan to do inside? “We will scream and shout our lungs out each time India hits a boundary or gets a wicket,” they said, showing a placard that read, “Use sunscreen to ward off YUVI-rays.”

Fans displayed their dedication to the Indian team by painting the tricolour on their face and nails. Some were dressed in the team colours.

“People are buying them in dozens, no one is bargaining...they are priced not by the making cost, but the value of waving them at the stadium,” said a vendor who had over 500 Indian flags in his car, parked strategically on the way to the stadium.

The air was truly electric as the fans broke into cheers and dance every five minutes and happily posed for the media.

Some Pakistani fans were also seen waving their country's flags. A 28-year-old billed it as “the mother of all World Cup clashes.”

No one was complaining even as normal life in the town literally come to a halt. Hundreds of commandos were deployed inside the stadium since morning and the entire VIP enclosure was sanitised. Spectators were advised to reach the stadium early so that they were not caught in traffic bottlenecks when the VIP movements started.
