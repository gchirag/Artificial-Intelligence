The Congress on Thursday said an FIR by the Uttar Pradesh police in the case of bees invading the stage during Chief Minister Mayawati's rally in Lucknow on Monday was “ridiculous” and “comic.”

It is a comic situation that the Chief Minister directs the administration to file an FIR for conspiracy to let off a bee attack on her, AICC general secretary in-charge for U.P. Digvijay Singh told journalists here. This shows the mental status in which Ms. Mayawati is doing politics as she sees a conspiracy in bees swarming the stage, he said.

The Bahujan Samaj Party has alleged that the appearance of bees at the rally ground was a conspiracy following which the State government ordered an inquiry.
