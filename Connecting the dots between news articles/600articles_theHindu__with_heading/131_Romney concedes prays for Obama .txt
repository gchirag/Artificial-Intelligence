U.S. Republican Presidential candidate Mitt Romney acknowledged early on Wednesday that he had lost to President Barack Obama but told supporters he was praying for the success of the President.

“I believe in America. I believe in the people of America,” he told supporters in Boston. “I ran for office because I’m concerned about America. This election is over, but our principles endure.” He said he would pray for the success of Mr. Obama and for the country after he had told reporters on election day on Tuesday that he had not prepared a concession speech, only victory remarks.

“I so wish that I had been able to fulfil your hopes to lead your country in a new direction,” Governor Romney said before being joined on stage by his wife, Ann; family; and running mate, Paul Ryan, “but the nation chose another leader, and so Ann and I join with you to earnestly pray for him and for this great nation.”
