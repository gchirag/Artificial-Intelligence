 The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has called for reports, within six weeks, from the Chief Secretaries of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala on reports that a fresh wave of suicide by farmers had been reported in these States this year.

The Commission was acting, suo motu, on media reports that as many as 680 farmers ended their lives in six districts of Maharashtra this year, 90 in six districts of Andhra Pradesh during October-November and eight farmers in Wayanad district of Kerala in November.

Most of these suicides mainly related to poverty, cash crunch due to inability to pay back loan dues, steep increase in input costs, failure of crops and pesticide attack.
Rights violation

The Commission observed that the contents of the media reports, if true, raised a serious issue of violation of human rights of the poor farmers in the three States.
