The world’s largest particle collider tests perhaps constitute the biggest experiment in the history of physics. The successful firing of two beams of protons in opposite directions has put an end to the tensions and fears leading up to the event.

That Indian physicists Sudhir Raniwala and Rashmi were part of the team of Indian scientists to develop one of the Photon Multiplicity Detectors is significant. What is more historically important is that the ‘boson’ in the elusive particle Higgs boson is named after Indian scientist S.N. Bose.

The CERN experiment to study the formation of the universe and related matters is a breathtaking effort by scientists. It is a matter of great pride for us that a contingent of scientists from India is associated with the team.
