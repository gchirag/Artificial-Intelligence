Police chiefs of Rajasthan and Gujarat discussed security arrangements ahead of the coming Assembly elections in Gujarat. Harish Chandra Meena, Director-General of Police, Rajasthan, and his Gujarat counterpart, Chittaranjan Singh, along with officials of the Border Security Force (BSF), assembled in Jodhpur at the BSF headquarters on Saturday to review the security arrangements.

Since Rajasthan and Gujarat share a substantial part of their borders, trans-border illicit activities ahead of and during the elections could prove to be a cause for concern for both the States.
