 Telugu film carries forward Rahman’s aura

The country is deliriously happy and so is the unit of Kalavaramaye Madhi Lo. Swati plays the lead role of an aspiring chartered accountant whose only ambition is to sing for A.R. Rahman. In fact she has his poster which is constantly around in her college bag. Satish Kasetty who won the national award for Hope is plunging into this musical story and has roped in Kamal Kamaraju, Vikram Gokhale and others for this film.

The Oscar bounty for Slumdog Millionaire is a dream come true. Will Kalavaramaye… be a fairytale for underdogs? Satish laughs, “there are indeed many similarities but 70 per cent of the shooting has already been done, this film has not been launched after Slumdog…won honours at Bafta.”

Was it difficult to shift gears to commercial drama? Satish says his script defines its own treatment. “Everyone wants a national award but no one wants to touch a national award director with a bargepole, they feel he will treat it like an art movie.”In Ashta Chemma Swati idolises Mahesh Babu, here she wants to audition for A.R. Rahman. Will Swati compose and sing an original song for her icon or not?
