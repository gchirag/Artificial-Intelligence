 Pakistan's Prime Minister Syed Yusuf Raza Gilani on Tuesday asserted that the world's most wanted man — Al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden — and Taliban spiritual head Mullah Omar were not in Pakistan as alleged by United States of America Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

Reacting to Ms. Clinton's contention during her two-day visit to Pakistan which concluded on Monday, Mr. Gilani said if anyone has credible and verifiable information establishing their presence on Pakistani soil, then it should be shared with the Government of Pakistan.

Interacting with a delegation of the All Pakistan News Agencies Council, Mr. Gilani was also reported as stating Ms. Clinton did not bring it up in her meetings with the top leadership of the Pakistan Government during her stay in the Capital.

Responding to questions from television anchors, Ms. Clinton had on Monday said that she believed Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar were in Pakistan.
Repeat

Essentially, Ms. Clinton was repeating something she had said in her first visit to Pakistan as Secretary of State in October 2009.
