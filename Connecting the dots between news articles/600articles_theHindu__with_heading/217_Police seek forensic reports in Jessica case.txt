NEW DELHI: The Delhi police is learnt to have written to the Central Bureau of Investigation requesting it to provide the forensic reports on the two empties recovered from the spot where Jessica Lal was gunned down in 1999.

The police plan to study the reports to find out at what stage the original empties were replaced to weaken the prosecution's case, which led to acquittal of the nine accused this February. The special team formed to probe the lapses would probably question the retired forensic official Roop Singh to record his version about the entire episode. Earlier, allegations were made that Mr. Singh was responsible for replacement of the original empty cartridges.
