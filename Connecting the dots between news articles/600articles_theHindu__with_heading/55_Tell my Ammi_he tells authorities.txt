Ajmal Kasab had one message to share before he was hanged on Wednesday. “Tell my Ammi [mother]” was what Kasab told the authorities after he was informed about his fate.

Home Ministry sources said India conveyed to Kasab’s mother Nooree Lai about the decision to hang her son through a letter sent by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad on Tuesday. After the formalities to hang Kasab were completed, Home Secretary R.K. Singh wrote to Foreign Secretary Ranjan Mathai asking him to inform Kasab’s mother.
