Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday thanked Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for his efforts to resolve the Jan Lokpal Bill logjam.

Speaking on the Ramlila grounds here before social activist Anna Hazare ended his 12-day-old fast, Mr. Kejriwal thanked leaders of political parties and MPs for passing the ‘sense of the House' resolution in Parliament on three demands of Mr. Hazare.

He dismissed the charge that Team Anna was against Parliament and that its methods were anti-constitutional.

Assurance

Mr. Kejriwal declared the team's respect for Parliament, the Constitution and its architect Dr. B.R. Ambedkar but added that “swaraj” was not electing people for five years and then be forgotten. “We give an open assurance that there is no constitutional impediment in adopting the Jan Lokpal Bill.”

Denying the allegations that the team members had called all politicians “thieves,” he said they were not against politicians. There were a lot of politicians who had supported their agitation and made efforts to resolve the issue. “We never called all of them thieves. All politicians are not corrupt. There are many good people.”

Referring to the success of their agitation, he said it was for the first time that parliamentarians agreed to make a law as per people's demand. “Why should it be that people have to protest for a law? There should be such a system that the government asks people before making a law. Every gram sabha should be able to participate in lawmaking.”
