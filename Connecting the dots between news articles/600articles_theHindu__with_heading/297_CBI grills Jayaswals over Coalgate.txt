 Continuing with its probe into the coal blocks allocation scam, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday interrogated four members of the Jayaswal family who are linked to three firms — the Nagpur-based AMR Iron and Steel Pvt. Ltd., the Nagpur-based JLD Yavatmal Energy Ltd. and Kolkata-based Jas Infrastructure Capital Pvt. Ltd. — named in the FIRs.

Fudging documents

The CBI has charged them with giving false information, fudging documents and concealing crucial facts to get coal blocks allotted.

CBI sources said Manoj, Arvind, Anand and Abhishek were first questioned individually about the coal block allocations to the three firms in which they are directors and then quizzed together to corroborate and examine their statements. They were also asked about their links with the Lokmat Group and its owner, Congress MP Vijay Darda. Sources said Mr. Darda, his brother Rajendra and son Devendra, who have also been named in the FIR related to JLD Yavatmal Energy Ltd., are also likely to be questioned soon.

In its identical FIRs in the cases related to these three firms, the CBI has said the company directors misrepresented and concealed facts, and allegedly connived with officials of the Coal and Power Ministries in the quest for getting coal blocks, thus obtaining wrongful gains.

It said they fudged documents to increase the net worth of their firms to meet the eligibility criteria for allocation of blocks, besides concealing the fact that they already had a few coal blocks.
