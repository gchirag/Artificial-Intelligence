 The first meeting of the Joint Parliamentary Committee to probe the 2G spectrum scam will be held between March 20 to 25, its chairman P.C. Chacko said on Tuesday.

The first JPC meeting to be held between March 20 to 25 would finalise the panel’s roadmap including witnesses to be called and documents to be sought, Chacko told reporters.

The 30-member JPC, which has been asked to give its report on the alleged 2G spectrum scam by the end of the next session of Parliament, was formed earlier this month after a prolonged stalemate in Parliament over the issue.

The formation of the JPC brought down the curtains on a three-month deadlock of Parliament between the government and the Opposition, which latched on to a CAG report on alleged irregularties in 2G spectrum allocations and pegged the presumptive loss to the national exchequer at Rs 1.76 lakh crore.
