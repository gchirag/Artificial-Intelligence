 The ICC Executive Board on Monday confirmed that the next two World Cups will be 10-team events and also announced that teams will be relegated and promoted on the basis of performance in the ODI league after the 2019 World Cup in England.

The Board had decided in October 2010 to reduce the number of participating teams in the flagship event of the game, which means that small nations, mostly Associate members will not get the chance to play at the big stage.

The 2015 tournament will be held in Australia and New Zealand.

“The Board agreed that the 2015 World Cup will comprise the existing 10 Full Members, however, they gave notice to all Full Members that participation in the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup will be determined on the basis of qualification,” an ICC statement said.

“It was also agreed that post the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019 there will be promotion and relegation introduced in the ODI League.”

The Board though in its October meeting had decided that the ICC World Twenty20 will comprise 16 teams. This would allow six Associates the opportunity to participate in an ICC global event every two years.

The Board have a thumbs up to the successful organisation of the 2011 World Cup by India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

“This ICC Cricket World Cup has been very successful and memorable. Whatever we achieved was due to the full support of the governments of Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and India.

“And in particular I would place on record our gratitude to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, Prime Minister of Bangladesh Sheikh Hasina and President of Sri Lanka Mahinda Rakapakse who are ardent followers of our great sport,” ICC President Sharad Pawar said in a statement.

“The tournament reinforced the attraction of 50 over cricket and showed the enthusiasm and excitement generated by nation v nation cricket. There is no doubt that this event has been a great advertisement for ODI cricket,” he said.
