New Delhi: Lyricist Gulzar, who shared the Oscar for his song “Jai ho” in Slumdog Millionaire with A.R. Rahman, has admitted that he never thought Indian lyrics could win the golden statuette.

It was “beyond my wildest dreams that Indian lyrics can ever win an Oscar. Indian songs never had a place there [in the West] and the credit for this recognition goes to Rahman,” Gulzar told a news channel.

The lyricist was profuse in his praise for the composer.

“What a team to work with. You see the spirit of a film in his music. It’s a pleasure to work with that man. He is an amazing innovator – the way he innovates the sounds is just amazing.”

“He is the one who broke the clichéd methods of music composition in the country and his innovativeness is the reason he has reached the Oscars. I am really proud of him,” Gulzar said.
