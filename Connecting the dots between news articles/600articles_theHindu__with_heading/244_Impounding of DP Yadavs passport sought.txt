 Ajay Katara, prime witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, moved a court here on Saturday seeking impounding of the passport of former Member of Parliament D. P. Yadav so that he does not leave the country. A bailable warrant was issued against Yadav for allegedly poisoning Katara on July 12.

Katara's advocate Khalid Khan claimed that Yadav was trying to get visas to various countries so that he can “escape from the case”. He contended before the court that Yadav's passport be impounded. The date for hearing the application has not been fixed. Yadav's son Vikas has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for killing Nitish.
