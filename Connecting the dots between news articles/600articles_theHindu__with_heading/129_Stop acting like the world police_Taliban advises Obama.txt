The Afghan Taliban on Wednesday said the newly re-elected U.S. President Barack Obama should focus on domestic problems and withdraw from war-torn Afghanistan as soon as possible to prevent the deaths of more of his soldiers.

“Obama has realised that the Americans are tired of the war and the back-breaking costs of the war,” said spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid in a statement. “Therefore, he should pullout the occupying forces from our country as soon as possible and prevent the deaths of more Americans.”

At least 67,000 U.S. troops are engaged in the war against the Taliban. More than 2,000 U.S. soldiers have been killed since it began in 2001.

“This time, Obama should use the opportunity well,” Mujahid said. “In order to stop increasing anti-U.S. sentiments in the world, Obama should prevent the U.S. from acting like the world’s police force and focus instead on solving of the problems of the Americans.” “Americans are tired of the war and the extravagant military expenses. Obama should listen to the people of the United States and put an end to all the hollow wars, and prevent the U.S. from committing more war crimes in the world,” the statement said. — DPA
