 Gujarat Chief Minister Narendra Modi has accepted an invitation of the Chinese government to visit that country for strengthening investment relations. The invitation was extended during a visit to the State on Monday by China's central government Vice-Minister Ai Ping, at the head of a delegation. The trip is expected in November, a Gujarat government spokesman said here.

Mr. Ai and Mr. Modi discussed the State's contribution in Asia's economic development and the visiting Minister was appreciative of Gujaratis' contribution to business development in different countries, including China, the spokesman said.

They discussed the possibilities of HUAWEI, China's biggest telecom company, investing in Gujarat.

The spokesman said Mr. Ai was impressed with Mr. Modi's proposal to develop a “Gautam Buddha circuit” to attract tourists and offered to send Chinese architects to assist in the construction of the proposed Buddha temple.
