 Australian captain Ricky Ponting, set to play his fifth World Cup and a record 40th match endorsed the ICC’s decision to keep the associate members out of the World Cup and Champions Trophy.

"You need to bring on some of these small nations into the world of cricket. We want to the see the game develop and blossom around the world. But I have always been unsure if the World Cups and Champions Trophy are the right place to do that. And I am not sure how much these teams actually learn when they are hammered in contests. At the end of the day it would probably be a better tournament if they were fewer teams (in the World Cup). It’s the pinnacle of the sport.We understand the responsibility to keep the game growing,’’ said Ponting.
