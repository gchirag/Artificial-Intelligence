nti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare has been provided with Z category security, when he is in his village, and travelling outside. Ahmednagar Superintendent of Police Krishna Prakash, who was responsible for the security arrangements at Ralegan Siddhi, visited Mr. Hazare on Friday to discuss the security measures.

Speaking to The Hindu on Friday evening, Mr. Prakash said Mr. Hazare had accepted the security reluctantly.

He said Z category security entailed two police officers, an escort car and a guard with Anna all the time.

He also recommended eight Quick Response Team personnel to be with Mr. Hazare.

However, Mr. Hazare's acceptance of the police security came with a rider. “Anna's only condition was that the security personnel should be in civil clothes.

He did not want to distance himself from the people by having uniformed police around him,” Mr. Prakash said.
