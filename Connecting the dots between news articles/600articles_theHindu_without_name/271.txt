Government on Sunday indicated an announcement about a JPC probe into the 2G spectrum scam will be made in Parliament on February 22.

Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee is believed to have conveyed this to a meeting of leaders of political parties here.

“The government has already agreed for a JPC...It has come in the media...,” CPI leader Gurudas Dasgupta told reporters when asked whether the JPC announcement would be made on February 22.

Another opposition leader, who declined to be identified, spoke in a similar vein noting that Mr. Mukherjee has requested the leaders not to speak to the media on the government stand on the issue.
