 Tamil Nadu Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa on Thursday extended “hearty greetings” to her Gujarat counterpart Narendra Modi for winning the Assembly polls for a third consecutive time.

Ms. Jayalalithaa rang up Mr. Modi and expressed “her hearty greetings”, a state government press release in Chennai said.

Mr. Modi, who maintains a good rapport with Ms. Jayalalithaa, attended her swearing-in ceremony after AIADMK swept back to power after the April 2011 Assembly elections.

She also deputed two of her party MPs Dr V Maithreyan and M Thambidurai as emissaries to attend Mr. Modi’s Sadbhavana Mission last year.
