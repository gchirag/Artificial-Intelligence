 The Udupi unit of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishath (ABVP) staged a protest against the scams of the Union Government in front of the Deputy Commissioner's Office here on Friday.

Speaking on the occasion, head of the Udupi unit of ABVP Sharan said that the Rs. 1.78 lakh crore 2G spectrum scam was the biggest scam in the history of the country. This scam could not have taken place without the knowledge of the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, AICC President Sonia Gandhi and AICC General Secretary Rahul Gandhi.

Prime Minister Manmohan Singh watched helplessly as his own cabinet colleagues ignored him. The post of the Prime Minister had been reduced to redundance. The release of the Niira Radi tapes had exposed the nexus between the media, corporate and politicians. “The 2G spectrum scam has brought into question the functioning of a constitutionally elected Government in the country”, he said.

The Congress party's hall of shame glittered with other trophies such as Rs. 78,000 crore Commonwealth Games scam in New Delhi and the Adarsh Housing scam in Mumbai. That the Union Government was blind to corruption was best illustrated by the fact that it did not even bother to reply to the letters written by the former Union Minister Subramaniam Swamy, Mr. Sharan said.

ABVP leaders Sriguru, Abhishek, Srinivas, Prithvi, Sanket, Sriram were present.
