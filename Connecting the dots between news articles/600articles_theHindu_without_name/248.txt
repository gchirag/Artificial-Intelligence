Continuing his argument for the third consecutive day in the Nitish Katara murder case, noted lawyer Ram Jethmalani, appearing for Vishal Yadav who along with his cousin Vikas Yadav is serving life imprisonment, charged on Thursday that the prosecution had not recorded the statement of his client as per the prescribed procedure.

Mr. Jethmalani submitted that the police should have recorded his statement before recovery of articles allegedly connected with the case. Strangely, they wrote the statement of the accused after recovery of the articles, Mr. Jethmalani stated.

He further submitted that the statement of the accused could not be relied as the police failed to take signature of any independent witness.

On Wednesday he had argued that the trial court had not conducted the trial of the case as per the prescribed procedure. He also charged that the prosecution did not follow the procedure while examining the witnesses.

A Division Bench comprising Justice Gital Mittal and Justice J. R. Midha has been hearing appeals by Vishal Yadav and Vikas Yadav against their conviction in the case by the trial court in 2008.

The trial court had in 2008 sentenced the two to life imprisonment, holding them guilty of kidnapping and later killing Nitish Katara, the son of an erstwhile IAS officer here.

Both convicts in their separate appeals have argued that it is a case of acquittal.

The Bench will take up the appeals for further hearing on July 10.
