Five persons, accused in an attack on Ajay Katara, prime witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, were on Thursday declared absconding by a local court.

The Chief Judicial Magistrate declared Dharmender Yadav, Subash Yadav, Anurag Yadav, Davender Singh Yadav and Vivek Kumar Bhatnagar as absconders in the case.

On July 16, 2008, Katara was allegedly attacked while he was on his way to Patel Nagar with his younger brother, two security guards and driver.

The five were booked.

On May 30, 2008, Vikas Yadav, son of former Rajya Sabha MP D.P. Yadav, his cousin Vishal Yadav and Sukhdev Pehalwan were awarded life term for killing Nitish Katara, a business executive.

Nitish was abducted from a marriage party at Ghaziabad on the intervening night of February 16-17, 2002.
