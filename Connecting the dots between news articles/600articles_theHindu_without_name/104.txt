Arrangements are in place to ensure the smooth counting of votes in Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh on Thursday, Chief Election Commissioner V.S. Sampath has said.

He told The Hindu here on Wednesday that for every constituency, the Election Commission appointed one observer to monitor the counting, which would start at 8 a.m. In the first 30 minutes, postal ballots would be counted. If the counting of postal ballots took up more than 30 minutes, electronic voting machines would also be taken up for counting.

The results would be declared only after the entire process was completed. The elections for the 182-member Gujarat Assembly were held on December 13 and 17, and for the Himachal Pradesh Assembly on November 4.
