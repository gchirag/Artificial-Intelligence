On August 11, 2010, Estonia beat Faroe Islands in the opening qualifying match for Euro 2012. Thus began the journey of 53 European nations to today’s final in Kiev.

Now we’re down to the two best teams — the defending champions Spain and a rejuvenated Italy — who’ll battle it out for the Henri Delaunay Trophy, named after the UEFA president who created the continent’s biggest tournament.

The final represents a unique opportunity for Spain to win an unprecedented third consecutive major tournament.

Widely hailed as one of the best teams ever, Spain has continued to impress fans and experts with its “aesthetic football” and incisive passing. However, the lack of an in-form striker has meant La Furia Roja (The Red Fury, as the team is called by its fans) has struggled to score goals at Euro 2012.

Spain’s inability to score goals gains further importance as Italy has been known for its strong defence. However, to view Italy as a defensive team would be unfair to Cesare Prandelli’s side as the Italians have surprised everyone with their attacking football and Spain-like passing. All eyes will be on the Italian orchestrator, Andrea Pirlo, who has charmed the fans with his mastery of passing and possession.

Spain and Italy opened their campaign against each other with a 1-1 draw and the final, like their opening game, will be a clash of different styles.

While Spain looks to wear its opponents down with its relentless passing, Italy has adapted itself well to an ever-changing mix of formations and tactics throughout the tournament.
