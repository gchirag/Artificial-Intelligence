New Delhi: The final hearing in the appeal filed by Manu Sharma challenging his life sentence in the Jessica Lal murder case began in the Supreme Court on Tuesday with counsel questioning the Delhi High Court’s ‘pre-determined motive’ in holding him guilty.

Ram Jethmalani, appearing for Sharma, said the High Court Bench had made up its mind to convict the accused as one of the judges refused to withdraw from the Bench. Narrating the sequence of events, counsel alleged that from everyday hearing it was clear that the Bench was going to reverse the acquittal by the trial court.

The prosecution case was that Jessica Lal was shot dead on the intervening night of April 29-30, 1999 at a party at Qutub Colonnade restaurant in south Delhi.

The trial court on February 21, 2006 acquitted all the nine accused, observing that there was lack of evidence against them.

However, the High Court on December 20, 2006 reversed the acquittal and awarded life imprisonment to Manu Sharma.

Arguing before the Supreme Court Bench of Justices P. Sathasivam and Swatanter Kumar, Mr. Jethmalani described as a farce an identification parade, as Sharma’s photograph was already published in all newspapers. The High Court judgment was ‘nothing but perverse’ and every finding of the trial court was rejected, he said. Arguments will continue on Wednesday.
