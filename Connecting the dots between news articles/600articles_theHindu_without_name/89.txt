 Aligarh: In the wake of Mumbai terror strikes, students of Aligarh Muslim University have asked politicians and media to refrain from “politicising and communalising the battle against terror.”

“Every terrorist attack is a blow to the entire humanity. It is imperative that the State deals firmly with perpetrators of terror irrespective of their religion and we stand united,” a memorandum, signed by over 500 students, addressed to President Pratibha Patil, said.
