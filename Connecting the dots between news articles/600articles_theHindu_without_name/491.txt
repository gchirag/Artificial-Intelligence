GUNTUR: Speakers at an awareness meeting on ‘Big Bang Theory’ have allayed the fears about myths of catastrophes associated with the experiment.

The meet was conducted on Sunday evening at Vavivala Library by Avagahana organisation.

Addressing the meeting, K. Rama Subba Rao, executive engineer at Raj Bhavan, said that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) designed by the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN), which experiment was similar to that of Big Bang, would not destroy the world as the black holes would be in sub-atomic scale and would collapse instantaneously.

He also dispelled the myth that LHC might reduce the entire planet to a life less hulk as the stragelets, would be harmful and said that they could decay instantaneously too.

Stating that the LHC is extremely safe, he also disproved fears of radiation from the high energy collision of LHC.

The Big Bang experiment was held with the intention of exploring the answers to the probing question, ‘How particles can collect mass?’
