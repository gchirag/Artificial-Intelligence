 The popularity of cricket in India is wooing global hospitality firms like Starwood and Marriott to jump on the IPL bandwagon to sponsor teams in IPL-IV.

While Marriott India Hotels Resorts has entered into a sponsorship agreement with the inaugural season winner Rajasthan Royals, Starwood Hotel & Resorts has chosen Delhi Daredevils. These global companies are loosening purse strings to sponsor teams on a bigger scale, rather than merely becoming a hospitality partner.

For instance, Rajasthan Royals has a new sponsor in Marriott India Hotels Resorts with which the team franchise has inked a deal.

Under the agreement, 80 per cent would be paid in cash and the rest by providing food and dining services.
