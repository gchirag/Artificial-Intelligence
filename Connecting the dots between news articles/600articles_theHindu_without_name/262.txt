 A day after defence lawyers in the 2G spectrum allocation scam case demanded copies of the Radia tapes, the Central Bureau of Investigation on Thursday told the special court hearing the case that it would provide by July 12 the taped conversations between corporate lobbyist Niira Radia and influential persons.

The tapes or their transcripts were not part of the documents submitted by the CBI along with the two charge sheets in the case though Ms. Radia has been listed as a prosecution witness.

On Wednesday, counsel for Unitech Wireless had pointed out that while the witness statement of Ms. Radia had extensive references to the taped conversations, cross-examining her was rendered impossible since the tapes or the transcripts had not been provided to the defence.

Special Judge O.P. Saini allowed the defence plea to install a scanner to digitally scan and prepare soft copies of all documents.

He directed that the scanning be completed “within two to three days.”
