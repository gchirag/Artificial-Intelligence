London: The Big Bang machine or the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which was shutdown following a technical snag just nine days after its launch in September last year, has re-started again.

The world’s largest machine developed by European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) started operating on Friday evening, 14-months after the fault caused one tonne of helium to leak into the 27-km long tunnel that houses it. “It’s great to see beams circulating in the LHC again,” said CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer. “It happened faster than anyone could have dreamed of. Everything went very smoothly,” said an official.

Sscientist want to learn more about the Higgs boson, a sub-atomic particle that is crucial to our current understanding of physics. Though it is predicted to exist, scientists have never found it.

CERN might try to reach a record-breaking beam energy of 1.2 trillion electron volts this weekend. The LHC will create conditions similar to those which were present moments after the Big Bang by smashing together beams of protons, BBC reported.

The Big Bang is the cosmic explosion hypothesised to have marked the origin of the Universe. The CERN has spent around 24 mn pound on repairing the machine.
