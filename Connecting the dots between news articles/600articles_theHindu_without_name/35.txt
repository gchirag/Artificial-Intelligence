The condition of the 23-year-old girl, who was gang-raped in a moving bus in Delhi last Sunday, continues to be critical and doctors are subjecting her to various tests on Sunday.

“We are subjecting her to all examinations and procedures. She continues to be critical,” Dr B D Athani, Medical Superintendent of Safdurjung Hospital, said.

Doctors had said on Saturday that the rape victim is psychologically “composed and optimistic” about her future and has started communicating.

Doctors had also said they are keeping the patient on high doses of antibiotics and high standards of hygiene —— two important factors for preventing infection.
