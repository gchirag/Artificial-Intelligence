Pakistani authorities began demolishing al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden's house in Abbottabad late on Saturday night, over nine-and-a-half months after he was killed on the premises in a late night swoop by U.S. Navy Seals.

Though there was no official word on why the house in the garrison town was being brought down, it is apparently being done to prevent the compound from turning into a pilgrimage point for those who sympathise with Osama's ideology or a tourist spot as it was fast becoming of late.
