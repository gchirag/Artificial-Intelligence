NEW DELHI: Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur, conducting trial of the Nitish Katara murder case here on Thursday dismissed an application by Bharti Yadav, a key prosecution witness, seeking withdrawal of its direction allowing the presence of Neelam Katara, mother of deceased Nitish Katara, in the court during her deposition scheduled on November 29.

Dismissing Bharti's plea, Ms. Kaur said: "I do not find any substance in the application of Ms. Bharti to keep Ms. Katara out of the court during her deposition."

In her application, Ms. Bharti had said that the presence of Neelam Katara during the recording of her evidence would cause prejudice to her and she would feel uncomfortable.

However, Ms. Kaur allowed a plea by Sukhdev, one of the accused in the case, for examination of Ms. Katara and her son Nitin Katara against him. The mother-son duo would be examined and cross-examined before the examination of Ms. Bharti Yadav, the Judge said.

On another application by the prosecution for examination of Nitin Katara against prime accused Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav, the court said that it would take up the plea for consideration on November 27.

The court also allowed a plea by the prosecution to interview Ms. Bharti before her examination in the court. Ms. Kaur said that during her interview by B.S. Joon, public prosecutor in the case, counsel for Ms. Bharti would also be present.

Ms. Bharti moved the Delhi High Court for quashing of the trial court direction asking the Ghaziabad police and the Delhi police to provide security to her during her travel to and from the court to depose. Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav are facing trial in the case for allegedly kidnapping and killing Nitish Katara.
