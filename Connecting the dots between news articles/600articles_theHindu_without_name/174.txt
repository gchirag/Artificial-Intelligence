Parents derive pleasure

Oscar awards

TIRUCHI: It was celebration time in Tiruchi district as elsewhere in the country.

Neither age nor occupations mattered for the celebrators who were spurred into raising a toast for the Mozart of Madras over his Oscar reap. They spontaneously expressed their delight by bursting crackers, exchanging greetings and distributing sweets, at times even to the accompaniment of dance.

In particular, students were glued to the small screens from early morning till they left home for their schools and colleges. For once, parents derived pleasure in updating their wards on the developments at the Oscar awards function through text messages in mobile phones.

Students of the Arokiyamatha Matriculation Higher Secondary School in the city waved the tricolour as soon as the news of Rahman’s moment of global glory broke out. They celebrated the occasion by offering cakes to his portrait and distributing sweets to their teachers.

Encomiums were pouring in for the talented music composer from various quarters. “Winning two Oscars is an incredible achievement that has made every countryman proud. Winning the coveted award is a dream for music composers across the globe. Rahman has pitch-forked Indian music to global standards”, N. Sekar, secretary of the Rasika Ranjana Sabha, Tiruchi, said.

Rahman’s visit to the Rockcity a few months back took the Tiruchiites by storm. During his short trip to the Jamal Mohamed College, he appealed to the students to strive for the nation’s betterment.

“Though short, students enjoyed every minute of Rahman’s presence in the campus”, M. Sheik Mohamed, College Principal, recalled with pride.
