The news of the hanging of Pakistan terrorist Mohammed Ajmal Amir Kasab to death comes as a morale booster to this National Security Guard (NSG) commando who risked his life to save many others in the 26/11 Mumbai counter-action.

‘‘It’s a victory of democracy and a morale booster for the Indian soldiers,’’ said P.V. Maneesh, who was seriously injured in the commando operation.

Talking to The Hindu on the phone from Sabarimala, Mr. Maneesh said Kasab had got what he deserved and his hanging was a proud moment for every Indian.

The nation has gone through every democratic process in executing the death sentence of even a dreaded terrorist and one cannot find any flaw in the process, he said.

Recalling the brave act of Major Sandeep Unnikrishnan who was killed in the NSG action against the terrorists, he said the hanging of Kasab was as a tribute to the valiant soldier.

Mr. Maneesh, now on his annual pilgrimage to the Lord Ayyappa temple, watched television on hearing the news of the hanging of Kasab from the Media Centre of the Information and Public Relations Department at the Sannidhanam on Wednesday morning.

Mr. Maneesh had suffered grave head injuries in a grenade blast during the commando operation and been bedridden for about a yearHe resumed his annual Sabarimala pilgrimage three years ago with the help of a few friends, who carried him on their shoulders from Pampa to the Sannidhanam.

A native of Azhikode in Kannur, Mr. Maneesh is now attached to the 122 Battalion of the Territorial Army in Kannur.
