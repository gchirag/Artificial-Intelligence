On a plea by Vishal Yadav, serving life term in the Nitish Katara murder case along with his cousin Vikas Yadav, for speedy hearing of his appeal against his conviction by the trial court, the Delhi High Court on Tuesday fixed February 1 as the date for taking up the appeals of the two convicts for final hearing.

Allowing his plea, a Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice S. Ravindra Bhat and Justice Pratibha Rani said it would hear both the appeals as well as the plea for enhancement of the sentence of life imprisonment awarded by the trial court to the two convicts in 2008 to capital punishment.

The Bench said it would hear the appeals and the application for enhancement of the sentence sought by the mother of Nitish Katara, Neelam Katara, on February 1 and 2.

Counsel for Vishal Yadav pressed for early hearing of the appeal citing a recent Supreme Court direction to dispose of it expeditiously. The two appellants had also earlier asked for bail on the ground of delay in hearing of their appeals against the conviction.

The Bench later asked counsel for the prosecution and the defence to file brief synopsis of their respective arguments within two weeks.
