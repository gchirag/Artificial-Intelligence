NEW DELHI: Vishal Yadav, a co-accused in the Nitish Katara murder case, on Friday moved the Delhi High Court in an appeal against his conviction in the case by a trial court here earlier this year.

The appeal came up for hearing before a Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice B.N. Chaturvedi and Justice P.K. Bhasin. The Bench posted it for consideration on November 17 along with a petition by Neelam Katara, mother of Nitish Katara, seeking enhancement of sentence from life imprisonment to death sentence for Vikas Yadav, prime accused in the case, and his cousin Vishal Yadav.

The trial court had awarded them life imprisonment.

In his appeal, Vishal submitted that there was no case against him. He submitted that the post-mortem report on the body did not establish anything against him.

As for prosecution witnesses, he submitted they were all planted. The sole eyewitness in the case, Ajay Katara, was an interested witness as he was related to the Neelam Katara family, the appeal said. Vishal further submitted that the recoveries in the case – a hammer with which Nitish was killed and the wrist watch found on the body—had been planted by the prosecution.

Vikas Yadav had earlier moved the Allahabad High Court against his conviction on the plea that his appeal lay in that High Court as the crime was committed in the territory which came under its judicial jurisdiction but the High Court had dismissed his plea.

Thereafter he moved the Supreme Court against the Allahabad High Court judgment. The matter is still pending in the apex court.

Ms. Neelam Katara in her petition has sought quashing of the lower court order on sentence arguing that it had failed to take into account several vital aggravating circumstances in the case against the two accused while deciding the point of sentence.
