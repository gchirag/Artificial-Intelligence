 Anti-corruption crusader Anna Hazare on Saturday said that those in the Congress supporting Union Home Minister P. Chidambaram should do so only after the necessary inquiry in the 2G scam case has been done.

Speaking at his hometown Ralegan Siddhi, Mr. Hazare said, “Some people are trying to shield Mr. Chidambaram. This is not right. This is not the way to give support.”

According to Mr. Hazare, people shielding Mr. Chidambaram are Congress leaders, especially Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Dr. Singh on Friday said Mr. Chidambaram continued to enjoy his confidence.
