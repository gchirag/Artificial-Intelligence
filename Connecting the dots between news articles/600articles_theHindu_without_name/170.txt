No short cuts Rahman is the synonym for dedication

With the Oscars, Rahman has proved himself a genius who is in full control of what he’s doing

I have to confess that I’m a reluctant Rahman fan. Being a diehard Ilaiyaraja aficionado you can call it an inherent resistance to change. I remember being outraged when Mani Ratnam told me that he was signing a new boy called Dilip Kumar especially after the superb score Raja gave for “Dhalapathi”. Contrary to popular belief there was no fallout between the two greats. Mani still has the highest regard for the maestro and makes it a point to wish him whenever they bump into each other socially. Well I even suggested that Mani get the songs done by the newcomer, but retain Raja for the background score. “Interesting but impractical,” was the retort. “Roja” released and everyone was humming “Chinna Chinna Asai”. It was only with “Thiruda Thiruda” that I warmed up to Rahman. I still consider it his best album.

Rahman changed the sound of music. I still wouldn’t compare him to Raja as far as background score is concerned, but he has composed some outstanding numbers. “He would have become famous even if we hadn’t introduced him,” says K. Balachander who produced “Roja”, Rahman’s first film.

“It so happened that we felt ‘Roja’ needed a fresh sound. I was shooting in Ooty when Mani sent me the song, “Chinna Chinna Asai” and I listened to it continuously for the next hour. I called Mani and told him it would be the hit of the decade.

In fact it was Ilaiyaraja who introduced me to him as his keyboard player but I had forgotten. Rahman is the synonym for dedication. He’s accused of being slow but the wait is worthwhile because he doesn’t believe in mediocrity,” says the veteran. We are well aware of his prowess as a musician.

His score for “Slumdog Millionaire” is passable when compared to his previous work. His tunes in “Delhi 6” are far superior but like always we need the West to endorse and approve.
