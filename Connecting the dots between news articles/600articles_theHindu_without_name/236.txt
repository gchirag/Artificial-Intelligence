The Delhi High Court took up appeals of Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav earlier this week for hearing but could not hear argument as counsel for the latter informed it that senior advocate Ram Jethmalani, who would argue for him, was busy with some other case.

A Division Bench of the Court comprising Justice Gita Mittal and Justice V.K. Shali adjourned the hearing to March 22.

On a plea by Vishal Yadav, serving life term in the Nitish Katara murder case along with his cousin Vikas Yadav, for speedy hearing of his appeal against his conviction by the trial court, the Delhi High Court had on December 13 last year fixed February 1 as the date for taking up the appeals of the two convicts for final hearing.

Both appeals

The Court had said it would hear both the appeals as well as the Neelam Katra's plea for enhancement of the sentence of life imprisonment awarded by the trial court to the two convicts in 2008 to capital punishment. Neelam Katara is the mother of Nitish Katara.

A trial court had in 2008 sentenced the two to life imprisonment, holding them guilty of kidnapping and later killing Nitish Katara, the son of an erstwhile IAS officer here, because they were opposed to Bharti Yadav's alleged affair with him. Bharti Yadav is the sister of Vikas Yadav.

Meanwhile, the Bench called for the medical records of Vikas Yadav on an allegation by Ms. Katara that the convict had visited hospitals 87 times by misusing his financial and political influence.
