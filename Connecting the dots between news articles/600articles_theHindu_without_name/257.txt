 Bharatiya Janata Party MP M. Venkaiah Naidu has alleged that corruption to the tune of about Rs.3 lakh crore took place in various scams in the country in the last six years during the Congress rule.

Speaking to the newsmen here on Wednesday, Mr.Venkaiah Naidu said in just two scams – the 2G spectrum and in the irregularities in Common Wealth Games – more than Rs.2.25 lakh crore corruption took place, and the UPA government should answer on why the Congress was mum on these scams.

Recalling that the Congress leaders stalled the proceedings in Parliament for more than 40 days in Bofors case and several days were wasted on other issues, Mr. Naidu said the disruption of Parliament sessions were taught by the 125-year old Congress party only. But, now the same Congress party was blaming the opposition parties, when they demanded for a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) on telecom scam, he alleged. Alleging that the CBI has not done any investigation in the last 14 months, Mr. Naidu wondered on why Prime Minister Manmohan Singh was silent on 2G spectrum scam. The BJP will organise rallies in all the State capitals in the country on December 22, to enlighten the people on the scams.

BJP State official spokesman S. Suresh Reddy and others were present.
