Members of various organisations, including the Anna Hazare Vedike and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, on Sunday celebrated Anna Hazare's “victory” in pressuring the Union Government to accept his conditions on Lokpal Bill.

They burst crackers and distributed sweets to people.

They gathered at the Gandhi Chowk and raised slogans in favour of Mr. Hazare.
