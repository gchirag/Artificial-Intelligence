NEW DELHI: Parliament on Tuesday raised a toast to the Oscar-winning team of Slumdog Millionaire. Borrowing the title of music director A. R. Rahman’s award-winning song, members greeted each other with “Jai Ho” as the two Houses met for the day.

In a congratulatory statement on behalf of the Lok Sabha, Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said this historic achievement has warmed the hearts of every Indian.

“The nation is proud of their achievement and it is clear acknowledgement by the international community of the high degree of excellence achieved by the Indian artists.”

Equally exhilarating, the Speaker noted, was the bagging of an Oscar by the documentary film Smile Pinki, which is based on an Indian real-life story.

“I am confident these achievements by our creative legends will inspire the talented youth of the country to realise its infinite potential and prove its mettle globally,” he said.

The Rajya Sabha applauded the achievement as soon as the House convened for the day with Chairman Hamid Ansari leading the members in congratulating the awardees.
