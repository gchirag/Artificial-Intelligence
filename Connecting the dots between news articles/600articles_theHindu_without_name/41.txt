 “I salute those who were moved enough to come out, protest and demand justice for the December 16 Delhi gang rape victim. The public upsurge after the incident was justified and necessary,” said Chief Justice of India Altamas Kabir.

However, there was an attempt by parties with ulterior motives to corrupt the movement.

Describing the gang rape as a shameful act, he said: “As a human being, my first reaction was that of shame that such an incident was allowed to happen. People have to be made sensitive to crimes happening against women and that is the only way forward.”

He was speaking at the 6th national conference on ‘Implementation of Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005’, in New Delhi on Monday.
