 The Republicans would maintain control of the U.S. House of Representatives, CNN projected on Tuesday, based on election results in the eastern and central United States.

There were not enough outstanding competitive races in the lower chamber of Congress for Democrats to regain control of the House, the broadcaster said.

Along with the U.S. President, voters were choosing the entire 435-member House and one-third of the 100-member Senate in Tuesday’s elections.

The House had been expected to remain in Republican control while races for the Senate, where Democrats hold the majority, were more competitive.
