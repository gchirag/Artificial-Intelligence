AHMEDABAD: While various voluntary organisations continue to hold programmes to "remind" the people of the "shameful episodes of post-Godhra riots," the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and other Sangh Parivar outfits organised a "shradhanjali" meeting here on Tuesday to pay tributes to the victims of the Godhra train carnage, on the fifth anniversary of the incident. The police tightened the security around the ill-fated S-6 coach of the Sabarmati Express, still kept in the Godhra station yard. The VHP volunteers, along with some of family members of the victims, held prayer meetings in front of the coach and paid floral tributes.

The VHP and some family members alleged discrimination by the UPA Government at the Centre in payment of compensation to victims. Nalin Bhatt, a suspended BJP leader, who formed the Hindu Hit-Rakshak Samiti, also visited Godhra to pay tributes to the victims.
