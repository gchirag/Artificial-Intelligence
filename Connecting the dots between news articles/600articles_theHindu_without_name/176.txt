 Making it clear that Anna Hazare would come out of Tihar Jail only if he is allowed to sit on a fast “unconditionally”, Team Hazare on Wednesday said it was ready for any discussion with the government after the permission is granted.

Noted lawyer and member of the Lokpal Joint Drafting Committee Prashant Bhushan said Hazare will continue to be inside the jail.

“He will continue to sit in the jail unless he is allowed to sit on a fast unconditionally at JP Park or some other place. Thereafter, we are ready for any discussion with the government. But before that it is not possible,” he said.

Noting that the issue has now “assumed serious propositions,” he said, “Before moving the Supreme Court, we have to discuss the issue with Hazare.”

He said if authorities allow Mr. Hazare to sit on an unconditional fast, then the Gandhian would come out of the Tihar jail.

Mr. Bhushan also demanded that the Delhi Police provide proper food and water to all those detained and kept at Chhatrasal Stadium here.

He said a number of protest marches will be held across the country on Wednesday.
