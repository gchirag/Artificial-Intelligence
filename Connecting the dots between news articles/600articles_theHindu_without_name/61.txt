The hanging of Ajmal Kasab evoked sharp reactions from two Muslim organisations here, both of which questioned the urgency showed in the rejection of his mercy petition.

Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamaath, a Muslim organisation, condemned the way Kasab was executed. State president P. Jainulabudeen said the organisation was not opposed to capital punishment.

“We are only saying that there should be no bias in the process of rejecting mercy petitions or commuting death sentence to life. When the mercy petitions of many others were pending, what was the urgency to reject Kasab’s petition and hang him?” he said. In a statement, the Indian National League also questioned the urgency shown in rejecting the mercy petition of Kasab.

However, the State unit of the Vishva Hindu Parishad welcomed the hanging, saying it would send a strong message to Pakistan-sponsored terrorists.

In a statement, it said it would remind the UPA government about Afzal Guru and the convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case whose mercy petitions were also pending for a long time.
