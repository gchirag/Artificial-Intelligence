 Barack Obama’s re-election as President of the United States is significant for not only Americans but also the rest of the world. Although his election four years ago generated the hope that he would bring about a perceptible change on the social security, health care, and employment fronts, and establish peace in Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran, he did not succeed entirely. Yet a majority of Americans have reposed faith in him believing he will deliver in his second term. One hopes he will be able to fulfil his goals in the next four years.

Mr. Obama’s victory reflects the maturity and wisdom of Americans. He came to power in 2008 promising change. But the U.S. is still facing an economic crisis. By electing him for a second time, people have reinforced their faith in him. Let us hope the best is indeed yet to come.

Another historic win for Mr. Obama has proved that good work pays. The U.S. policies in the past four years have been focussed on holistic development. The Republicans used the race card to pull the elections off but the U.S. has proved once again that it is not colour but the enthusiasm to usher in change that determines a candidate’s potential.
