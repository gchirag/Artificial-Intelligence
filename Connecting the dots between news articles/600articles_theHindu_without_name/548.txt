CPI functionaries burnt an effigy of Union Railway Minister Pavan Kumar Bansal at Kadapa One Town circle on Tuesday. The CPI (M) alleged injustice to the State in the railway budget while the Congress termed it a pro-people budget.

CPI city secretary G. Chandra resented non-mention of the Kadapa-Bangalore railway line in the budget and said that the State was meted out a raw deal in successive railway budgets.

He demanded resignation of Union Minister for State for Railways Kotla Suryaprakash Reddy for failing to promote the interests of the region.

CPI (M) city secretary N. Ravisankar Reddy said that there was no mention of the Kadapa-Bangalore, Yerraguntla-Nandyal, Obulavaripalle-Krishnapatnam railway lines in the budget. He welcomed the announcement of Kambham-Markapuram-Proddatur railway line.

Meanwhile, Kadapa DCC general secretary S.A. Sattar termed it a pro-people railway budget with no fare hike despite incurring losses to the tune of Rs. 24,000 crore. He welcomed linking of Aadhar card with ticket reservation and 10 per cent quota for women in Railway Protection Force jobs.
