 Mere upar daya karo aur mujhe phansi se riha karo ,” was what the main convict of the 26/11 attacks, Ajmal Amir Kasab, wrote to President Pranab Mukherjee in his mercy petition on September 12, 2012. President’s Secretariat has, for the first time on March 6, released the copy of Kasab’s mercy petition in response to a query by activist Subhash Chandra Agarwal filed under the Right to Information Act.

Kasab was hanged on November 21 last year after his mercy petition was rejected by the President.

“Sir, mujhe phansi ki saza Supreme Court se ho gayee hai . Phansi ki saza se mujhe chhod diya jaye. Mere upar daya karo aur mujhe phansi se riha karo. Meri aapse darkhwast hai ,” goes Kasab’s complete letter to the President.

The documents released by the Secretariat have also revealed the civil society campaign for Kasab’s death penalty to be commuted into life imprisonment. As per the documents, senior lawyer Yug Mohit Chaudhary, a leading campaigner against death penalty, wrote to the President in October 2012, requesting him to commute Kasab’s death penalty to life imprisonment.

Mr. Chaudhary’s petition to the President was part of the larger campaign against death penalty. The letter was endorsed by more than 200 people, including former Director of National Police Academy Sanker Sen, senior lawyer Vrinda Grover, Amrita Shodhan from School of African and Asian Studies, UK, actor director Aamir Bashir, activist Harsh Mander, journalist Aakar Patel and writer Mahasweta Devi. The President also received appeals from foreign nationals and organisations for the commutation of Kasab’s death penalty, including those from UK, Germany, France, Sweden, Spain, Australia, Switzerland and Canada.
