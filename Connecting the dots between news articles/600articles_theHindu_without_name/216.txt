NEW DELHI: The Delhi Police on Tuesday issued `look out' notices for witnesses in the Jessica Lal murder case to prevent them from leaving the country.

The notices were issued to ensure that the witnesses are available for interrogation and do not leave the country during the probe by the Special Investigating Team (SIT).

Some of the main witnesses, including socialite Beena Ramani and her husband George Mailhot, have foreign passports.
