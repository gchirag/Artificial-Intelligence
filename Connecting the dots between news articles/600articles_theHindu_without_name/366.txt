After the Gujarat government further extended its term, the G.T. Nanavati - Akshay Mehta judicial inquiry commission probing into the Godhra train carnage and the post-Godhra communal riots of 2002 has summoned the then Minister of State for Home, Gordhan Jhadaphia, for cross-examinations.

Mr. Jhadaphia, who had deposed before the commission last year, has been asked to appear before it again on December 27 for cross-examination by Jan Sangharsh Manch advocate Mukul Sinha and others so that more light could be thrown on the situation that prevailed then and the steps the State took or did not take.
