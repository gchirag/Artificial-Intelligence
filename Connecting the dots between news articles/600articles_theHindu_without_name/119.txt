 Countering Congress president Sonia Gandhi’s charges that the ruling BJP’s promises were “hollow and false,” Chief Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that she was “spreading lies” against his government.

“It is shameful how Sonia Gandhi is spreading lies on issues about which Congress has lost right to speak,” he told a an election rally.

“Ms. Gandhi says Gujarat roads are bad. Is that believable? She says Gujarat farmers are ruined. Is that how the State sees 11 per cent growth in agriculture?” Mr. Modi said. The Chief Minister addressed public rallies in Falla, Jamnagar and Ahmedabad.

Giving an example of the girl, who was arrested from Palghar in Maharashtra for her comments on Facebook about Bal Thackeray, Mr. Modi said, “She prefers to stay in Gujarat over Maharashtra.” The girl and her family have since shifted to Gujarat.
