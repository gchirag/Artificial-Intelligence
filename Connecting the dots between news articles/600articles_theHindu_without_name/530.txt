Senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader and party Andhra Udyama Committee Chairman Bathina Narasimha Rao on Tuesday dismissed the railway budget as “disappointing”.

Reacting to the maiden railway budget presented Railway Minister Pawan Kumar Bansal, he said Andhra Pradesh had failed to get allocation for any big projects in the Railway Budget.

The Railway Minister has not granted new lines, doubling or electrification of the existing lines in the State, he lamented.

People of the State had been expecting a fair deal for the State with inclusion of Mr. Kotla Suryaprakash Reddy as Union Minister of State for railways. But their hopes had been belied, he added.
