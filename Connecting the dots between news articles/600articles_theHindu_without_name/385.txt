 NEW DELHI: BJP chief Rajnath Singh on Sunday appointed NarendraModi to the party's parliamentary board, foiling a last-gasp resistance to the Gujarat chief minister's return to the top decision-making body after a gap of seven years.

Sources said Rajnath shoved aside the opposition to Modi saying the latter deserved to be on the parliamentary board because of his stature as the only chief minister to have won three consecutive elections as well as by virtue of being the party's most popular face.
