 The Central Bureau of Investigation on Monday registered two new first information reports in connection with its ongoing probe into the scam-tainted allocation of coal blocks between 2006 and 2009. The agency booked New Delhi-based Green Infrastructure Pvt. Ltd. (now Athena Infra Projects) and Kamal Sponge Steel & Power Ltd, Satna in Madhya Pradesh, and their top functionaries, and conducted raids at their offices in six cities.

The firms and their directors have been charged with misrepresentation of facts and giving false information to get coal blocks allocated. The CBI has also named in the FIRs “unknown” public servants, whose roles in helping them get coal blocks are being investigated.

Searches were conducted at the offices and other premises of the two firms at 16 locations in Hyderabad, Secunderabad, Rourkela, Satna, Jaipur, Visakhapatnam and Delhi.

According to CBI sources, the firms and their officials have been booked for criminal conspiracy, and cheating under the Indian Penal Code, and sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act. In the case against Green Infrastructure, the CBI has named as accused chairman Parthasarthy Commandur and directors M.S. Ramkrishna, Yugandhar Meka, Allure Raju Sitarama, Vemuri Ramesh and Prasad N.

Similarly, Kamal Sponge Steel & Power directors Pavan Kumar Ahluwalia, Kamaljeet Singh Ahluwalia, Prashant Kumar Ahluwalia, and chartered accountant Amit Goyal have been named in the FIR.

Allegations are that both firms showed inflated net worth figures and concealed important facts in order to meet eligibility requirements for allocation of coal blocks.

Following instructions from the Chief Vigilance Commissioner in June to inquire into irregularities in allocations during 2006-09, the CBI has so far registered nine cases.
