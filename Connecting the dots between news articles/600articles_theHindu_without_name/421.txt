Vicente del Bosque made a tactical blunder by sacrificing Cesc Fabregas in the ‘false nine’ role and bringing in Alvaro Negredo. The Barcelona midfielder had done justice to the role so far by dragging the defenders out of position and allowing David Silva to cut in and combine well with Andres Iniesta.

In this encounter, Negredo was well marshalled by Pepe and Bruno Alves and he seemed to have little idea what his job was. As a result, Silva was ineffective.

The Seleccao broke from the normal mould and played high up the pitch, pushing the defending champion into unaccustomed mess and uncertainty. Spain was struggling to get fluidity and was constantly under pressure (it hit unusually 29 long balls in the first-half).

The Portugal defenders also maintained a high line to make sure there wasn’t a huge gap between midfield and attack. Nani started brilliantly on the right and Cristiano Ronaldo seemed full of dangerous intent on the other.

When Portugal had the ball, it often had four men in attack: the wingers, striker and a supporting midfielder. But they were pathetic in the attacking third. The Real Madrid striker had seven shots in all, but none of them on target.

It was not until Fabregas came on in the second half, joined by traditional wingers Jesus Navas and Pedro Rodriguez, that Spain rediscovered its rhythm and angles. The defending champion was able to dictate from the flanks with Fabregas dropping deep from the centre-forward position.

With fatigue beginning to show in Portugal’s play, Spain dominated possession in extra time and won the tie on penalties.
