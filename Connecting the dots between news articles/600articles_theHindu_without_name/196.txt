 The Delhi Police did not want Anna Hazare to fast for more than three days at the Jaya Prakash Narayan park on Bahadurshah Zafar Marg here and that too without a tent or the use of a microphone.

The other condition that the police imposed on Mr. Hazare was to not allow more than 5000 people in a park, that Team Hazare said, could hold at least 20,000 people. The police also wanted them to restrict the number of vehicles to 50. It decided that only a government doctor would examine Anna Hazare and decide whether he be force-fed or removed to hospital, not a private doctor.

 Of the 22 conditions, these were six that they did not agree to leading to the police denying them permission to stage a fast at the venue offered by the police.

“We rejected these conditions as they were a clear violation of our fundamental rights,” the Team members said in a press release.
