 The railway ministry should start a helpline for women passengers so that they can complain in case of any emergency, Madhu Bansal, wife of Railways Minister P.K. Bansal, said Tuesday.

With Mr. Bansal about to present the railway budget in parliament, his wife said she wants the railways to ensure cleanliness in trains and safety for women.

“I generally travel between Chandigarh and Delhi and find the journey safe. I feel the railways should have a women helpline so that female passengers can lodge a complaint in case of any problem,” Ms. Madhu Bansal told reporters here.
