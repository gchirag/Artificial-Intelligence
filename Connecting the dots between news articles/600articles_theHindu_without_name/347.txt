 The first movie depicting raid by U.S. special forces to kill world’s most wanted terrorist, Osama bin Laden, will hit the American television airways on November 4, 48 hours before the presidential polls.

Titled Seal Team Six, the movie made by National Geographic Channel is all set for opening on November 4, more than a month before the theatrical opening of the much awaited film by Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow Zero Dark Thirty.

“We wanted to be first to bring this story to viewers,” National Geographic Channels president Howard T. Owens told The Hollywood Reporter.

Mr. Owens says the decision to debut the movie days before the election wasn’t motivated by politics.

Notwithstanding his comments, co-producer of the film Harvey Weinstein is a prominent fundraiser for President Barack Obama.
