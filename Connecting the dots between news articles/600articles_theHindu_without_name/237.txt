 Bharti Yadav asked to move the trial court

Complaint against her father, ex-Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadav, and uncle, Bharat Singh
Ms. Bharti had come to India last November and gave her evidence in the case

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed Bharti Yadav, a key prosecution witness in the Nitish Katara murder case, to move a trial court here for quashing of a complaint against her father, former Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadav, and maternal uncle, Bharat Singh, accusing them of not allowing her to come to India from London to depose in the case.

Justice A. K. Sikri directed Bharti Yadav to file an application in the court of Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur, hearing the Nitish Katara murder case, as the complaint was pending in that court.

Ms. Bharti had moved the High Court seeking quashing of the complaint.

Neelam Katara, mother of deceased Nitish Katara, had filed the complaint accusing the two of not allowing Ms. Bharti to come to India to depose in the case.

In her application, Ms. Bharti said since she had deposed in the case, the complaint had become infructuous.

Ms. Bharti had come to India last November and gave her evidence in the case in the court of Ms. Kaur. She had denied the statement attributed to her by the prosecution.

Counsel for Ms. Bharti submitted that she had delayed her arrival in India to record her statement in the case as she was busy with her studies in London.

Prosecution

Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav, brother and cousin respectively of Ms. Bharti, are facing prosecution in the case for allegedly kidnapping Nitish Karata, son of a senior IAS officer here, and later killing him because they were allegedly opposed to Ms. Bharti having an affair with Nitish.
