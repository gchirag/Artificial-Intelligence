 The Communist Party of India (Marxist) on Monday said though the search for Osama bin Laden has ended with his killing, the question as to how he lived in Pakistan for so long without being found remains.

“The hunt for Osama ended and he was killed by the American Special Forces, but this raises the question as to how he has lived so many years undetected in Pakistan,” party general secretary Prakash Karat said. Speaking to The Hindu over phone from West Bengal, where he is campaigning, Mr. Karat said that in the name of fighting al-Qaeda, the U.S. had devastated Iraq and Afghanistan. It should be remembered that the likes of Osama were financed and equipped by the Pentagon and the CIA to wage ‘jihad' in Afghanistan in the 1980s.
