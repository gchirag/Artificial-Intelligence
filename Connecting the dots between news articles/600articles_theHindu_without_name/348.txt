 Stung by lingering suspicions that it was complicit in sheltering Osama bin Laden, Pakistan's spy agency has claimed credit for helping U.S. intelligence agencies locate the high-walled hideout of the terror mastermind. “The lead and the information actually came from us,” a senior official of the Inter-Services Intelligence told Washington Post, in what the paper said was a push for recognition ahead of the anniversary of the stealth raid that killed bin Laden.

The official claimed that it was ISI which had provided CIA with a cellphone number that eventually led to an al-Qaeda courier Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti, the paper said.

But the Post said that U.S. officials disputed the ISI version.
