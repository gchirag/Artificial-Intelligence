A team of CBI officers would be leaving for Mauritius next week to track the trail of money invested in various telecom companies involved in the 2G spectrum allocation scam, the CBI told the Supreme Court on Monday.

Senior advocate K.K. Venugopal appearing for the investigating agency said the team would be leaving on May 16 and will file its report before the court on the investigation done by it.

A bench of justices G.S. Singhvi and A.K. Ganguly directed the agency to file its report on the probe into the money trail by May 31 and posted the matter for further hearing on July 6.

The bench also directed the CBI to expedite its enquiry against a journalist who had allegedly tried to bribe an Enforcement Directorate official who was inquiring into 2G scam.
