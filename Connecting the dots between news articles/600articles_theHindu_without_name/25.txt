 Syed Kirmani hopes that Mahendra Singh Dhoni's team will win the ICC Cricket World Cup to be played in India in February- April 2011.

“I was part of the 1983 World Cup winning Indian team and I am still living that dream. We beat the West Indies in the opening match at Old Trafford and thereafter we did not look back.'' said Kirmani after unveiling the World Cup at the Reliance Mobile office at Ballard Estate here on Wednesday.
