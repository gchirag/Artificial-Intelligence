Italy has qualified for the 2013 Confederations Cup in Brazil by reaching Sunday’s final of the European Championship against Spain.

Spain has already qualified for the eight-nation competition as the 2010 World Cup holder. Should the Spanish win on Sunday, their European champion’s spot will automatically go to the runner-up.

The Confederations Cup is held every four years and is seen as a warm-up event for the World Cup, held the following year.

Italy reached the Euro 2012 final in Kiev, Ukraine by beating Germany 2-1 on Thursday in Warsaw.
