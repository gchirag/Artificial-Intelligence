CUTTACK: Expressing displeasure over the non-submission of the State government affidavit in response to a PIL over farmers’ suicide in the State, the High Court on Thursday asked the government in no uncertain manner to positively file its counter affidavit on Friday.

The Bench of acting Chief Justice I M Quddusi and Justice Sanju Panda adjourned the hearing of the case to Friday.

The Balangir Zilla Krushak Mahasangha had petitioned the HC seeking a direction for an impartial investigation into the incidents of farmers’ suicide in the State. On being asked by the court, the Mahasangha had recently submitted to court a list marginalised farmers who are burdened with loans from financial institutions.

It claimed that at least 40 farmers in the State have now committed suicide in recent past due to acute poverty .
