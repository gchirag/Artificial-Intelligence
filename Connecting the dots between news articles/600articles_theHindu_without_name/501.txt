Suresh C. Angadi, MP, has criticised Union Finance Minister P. Chidambaram for ignoring the plight of drought-affected farmers in Karnataka and not providing relief in the annual budgetary proposals that were presented in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.

In a release, Mr. Angadi said the Centre was aware of the losses suffered by the farmers owing to drought and poor rainfall during 2012. Appeals were made to the Centre several times to waive agricultural loans, but the Finance Minister has not responded to the farmers’ plight.

There was nothing credible or revolutionary about the proposals made by Mr. Chidambaram. This budget won’t help in boosting economic growth, Mr. Angadi said.

President of the Belgaum Chamber of Commerce and Industries Satish Tendolkar described the proposals as an “inflation check budget”, which was the need of the hour.

The economy was in a bad shape, and one could hope that this budget would take the economy forward in a phased manner. The Finance Minister had attracted foreign investments by presenting a stable budget, Mr. Tendolkar added.

The chamber welcomed certain measures proposed in the budget, such as the development of a Bangalore-Mumbai Industrial Corridor, which would boost industrial growth in the State. Other proposals that the chamber approved of are the lowered security transaction rate and a home loan benefit that would help infrastructure development.
