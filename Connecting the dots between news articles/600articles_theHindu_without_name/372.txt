Although Narendra Modi has received accolades from many for good governance and for ushering in spectacular prosperity in Gujarat, his other side is disturbing. While one does not know whether or not the affidavit filed by Sanjiv Rajendra Bhatt, a senior police officer — claiming that the Chief Minister asked the police in 2002 to let the rioters “teach a lesson” to Muslims after the Godhra train burning incident — is true, it is no doubt the tip of the iceberg. If what Mr. Bhatt says is true, Mr. Modi clearly launched a hate campaign against the minorities. Is it any surprise, then, that the innocent people, and not the perpetrators of the Godhra carnage, bore the brunt of the dreadful consequences?
