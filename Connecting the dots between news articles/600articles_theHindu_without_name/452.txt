A day after Union Finance Minister Pranab Mukerjee dismissed the possibility of creating more States, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Mayawati shot off another letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh demanding the creation of Purvanchal (eastern U.P.)

“If the Centre approves the proposal a resolution on the subject passed by the Vidhan Sabha would be sent,” Ms. Mayawati said.

This is the second letter she has sent to Dr. Singh in the last three days, in support of her demand to trifurcate Uttar Pradesh. On Friday, the Chief Minister had demanded the creation of separate states of Bundelkhand and Western U.P.

Incentive package

Simultaneously, Ms. Mayawati reiterated her demand for a special Rs. 80,000-crore incentive package for the integrated development of Bundelkhand and Purvanchal. The contents of the letter were disclosed by Additional Cabinet Secretary Vijay Shankar Pandey at a news conference here on Sunday.

Ms. Mayawati said the creation of Purvanchal would not only ensure better administrative management and fulfil the aspirations of the people of the region, it would also help remove regional imbalances. She urged Dr. Singh to expedite the proposal. On October 31, 2007, the State government had favoured the creation of Purvanchal on the floor of the Vidhan Sabha.
