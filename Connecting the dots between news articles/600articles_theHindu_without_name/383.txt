 This refers to the article “Counting wrongly to 2014” (June 23). Narendra Modi is a regional leader of a national party, from a small State. Whether or not Gujarat is shining, he has been able to remain Chief Minister even after the 2002 pogrom.

Anybody can nurture the dream of becoming Prime Minister. There are many ambitious BJP leaders from larger States who, I am sure, have a similar dream. In the event of Mr. Modi being backed by the sangh parivar for Prime Minister, the other BJP leaders will rake up the 2002 riots. That will sound the death knell for his dream.
All that Mr. Modi did was to generally criticise the caste-based politics that has eaten into the vitals of Bihar’s social, economic and political life for decades.

Is Mr. Modi’s anti-secular image despicable but not the politics of caste/sub-caste during elections? The fact of the matter is neither Mr. Modi nor Mr. Kumar has done anything worthy of prime ministership.
