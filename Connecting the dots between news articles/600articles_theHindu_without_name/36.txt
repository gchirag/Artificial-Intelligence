 The Delhi Police on Tuesday opposed the plea of two of the four accused in the December 16 gang-rape case for using Hindi language during the trial proceedings, as they do not understand English, terming it a “delaying tactic.”

“The applications have been filed after 63 witnesses have been examined, so it is purely a delaying tactic on the part of the accused,” Special Public Prosecutor Dayan Krishnan told the fast track court hearing the case, while responding to the plea of Mukesh and Akshay Singh.
