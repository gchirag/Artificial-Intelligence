 Yuvraj Singh's enthusiasm can be infectious as Team India experienced in difficult situations on the World Cup 2011 campaign. Sahara Pune Warriors named him skipper for its debut season in the Indian Premier League fourth edition besides assembling a talented bunch of players.

The skipper, mature and confident after a huge contribution to India's success, can dazzle in IPL-IV after being down in the dumps last time with Kings XI Punjab.

Problem of plenty

Warriors coach Geoff Marsh, assisted by Dermot Reeve and Praveen Amre, faces a problem of plenty when chalking out selection plans.

Apart from a match-winner in Yuvraj, the Pune squad has Twenty20 specialists in Manish Pandey and Robin Uthappa who made the switch from Royal Challengers Bangalore. New Zealand all-rounder Nathan McCullum and Jesse Ryder are explosive batsmen and the team's progress into the World Cup semifinals has given them opportunities to make adjustments in their game for sub-continent conditions.

Both the Kiwi players can step in to fill the gaps left in the bowling department due to injuries to the versatile Angelo Mathews and left-arm paceman Ashish Nehra. Both missed the World Cup final. West Indian paceman Jerome Taylor is considered a T20 specialist.

IPL success in earlier events have been built around domestic stars. Pune Warriors has the right mix of experience and talent in Mohnish Mishra, Harpreet Singh, Abhishek Jhunjhunwala, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Dheeraj Jadhav, Harshad Khadiwale and Shrikant Mundhe.

The calming influence of middle-order bat Mithun Manhas will be valuable to Yuvraj in taking quick decisions, while South African opener Graeme Smith has been part of a winning squad with Rajasthan Royals.
