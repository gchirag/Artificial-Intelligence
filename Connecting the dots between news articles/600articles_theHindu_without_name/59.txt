 The Supreme Court’s decision to uphold the death sentence awarded to Kasab was along expected lines. Whether or not Pakistan takes note of the verdict, the Indian government should take note of it. It should not hold Kasab indefinitely in an Indian jail at the cost of the exchequer. The sense of justice will prevail only if the sentence is carried out. It will instil confidence among ordinary citizens and send a warning to those intending to perpetrate terrorist activities from across the border, and their sleeping cells in the country.

I was startled by the cacophony of self-styled rights activists in the electronic media, who argued that Kasab should be jailed for life, not hanged. They maintained that hanging Kasab would make him a martyr. Nothing can be farther from the facts on which the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence. Kasab waged a war on the state. He was given ample opportunity to defend himself and the trial was conducted professionally. As long as Kasab is kept alive, he will constitute a serious security threat.
