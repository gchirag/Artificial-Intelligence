 Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi will hold a day-long “Sadbhavna Fast” on Tuesday in Jamnagar.

Ahead of the fast, Jamnagar BJP city unit has planned to take out ‘padyatra’ from Dhorol town to Jamnagar city, party sources said adding the yatra would be flagged off by BJP’s state unit president R C Faldu.

Mr. Modi will hold similar fasts in Junagadh on December 22 and in Rajkot on December 26, party sources said.

Congress would stage parallel fasts against Mr. Modi at all the three venues.
