The condition of the 23-year-old woman who was gang-raped, assaulted and thrown out of a moving bus here on Sunday night “deteriorated further on Tuesday”, according to doctors at Safdarjung Hospital, where she is undergoing treatment.

“Her condition continues to be very critical and there is, in fact, deterioration in her health. Her ventilator support has been enhanced, her blood pressure is very low, pulse high, and there has been a significant drop in the platelet count. The patient has suffered extensive injuries all over the body and her intestines are severely damaged. The woman has been brutally assaulted and we are treating her for multiple injuries. Our team is monitoring her condition closely and we are ready to conduct surgery as and when required,” said Medical Superintendent B.D. Athani.

This could easily be called “the most cruel incident reported from anywhere in the country,” he said. “The nature of her injuries is so severe that we are keeping our fingers crossed. At the hospital we are taking all measures to ensure that we are able to save the life of the patient, but so far there has been no positive change in her health status.”

Meanwhile, her mother was allowed to meet her.
