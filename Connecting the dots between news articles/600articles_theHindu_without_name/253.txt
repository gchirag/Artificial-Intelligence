 In the wake of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam expressing its willingness to support the United Progressive Alliance government if the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam withdraws support, the Bharatiya Janata Party on said it had no issues with any “permutations and combinations” as long as Telecom Minister A. Raja is removed and a JPC probes the 2G spectrum scam.

“BJP stand is that A. Raja should be sacked immediately and a Joint Parliamentary Committee probe should be ordered into the 2G spectrum allocation scam. As long as a thorough investigation is held, we have no issues about the permutations and combinations that may take place,” party spokesperson Nirmala Sitharaman told PTI.

She was replying to a question on the AIADMK possibly replacing the DMK in the UPA coalition.

Ms. Sitharaman said the first concern of her party was removal of Mr. Raja from the Union Cabinet and a thorough investigation by a JPC into anomalies in allocation of 2G Spectrum.
