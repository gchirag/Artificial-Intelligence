 Team Anna Hazare on Thursday indicated that it may not insist on the judiciary being brought under the ambit of the Lokpal if the govt brings out a “good” Judicial Accountability Bill.

The RTI activist and team Hazare member, Arvind Kejriwal, also said if Anna Hazare is forcibly taken away from the Ramlila Maidan on the grounds of ill health then the social activist would even stop drinking water.

“PM has to be within the ambit of the Lokpal. As far as the judiciary is concerned, if a good Judicial Accountability bill can be brought along with the Jan Lokpal Bill then we are open to it,” he told reporters outside Tihar jail.

He said it is not necessary that the fast will continue for 15 days. It depends on how the government responds to the demands put before it, he said.

When asked why Mr. Hazare was still at Tihar jail, Mr. Kejriwal said Anna could not go to Ramlila Maidan as it was not ready.

Earlier, former Law Minister Shanti Bhushan had claimed the provisions of the Lokpal Bill put forward by the Hazare team were “totally” Constitutional.

“I can certify that they are Constitutional and I think it would be wise for the government to withdraw the (present) bill from Parliament and move a fresh bill after talking to Anna.”
