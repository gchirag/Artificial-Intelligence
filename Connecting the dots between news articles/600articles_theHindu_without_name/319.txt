 It seems the cricket euphoria after India's historic world cup victory is ready to spill over to the season IV of the Indian Premier League (IPL).

Come April 9 and the much-awaited IPL will come to Kochi's Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium with oodles of glitz and glamour. IPL debutants Kochi Tuskers Kerala is pitted against Bangalore Royal Challengers in the opening game.

The craze for IPL is growing and the youth in Kochi feel that the event would provide wholesome entertainment in the days to come. Geordie Job Pottas, a student of PGDM programme at SCMS-Cochin, said that the euphoria will be at an all-time high following the historic world cup win. “People of India shall cherish this opportunity to celebrate the world cup win for an extended time,” he said.

Toby Babu, student of Computer Science and Engineering branch at the Model Engineering College (MEC) at Thrikkakara, said that he will be at the stadium along with his friends on April 9 to watch the Kochi Tuskers in action. “We will play drums to cheer the team. My friends will also display banners wishing Kochi Tuskers an emphatic win,” he said.

Vidya Nair of SCMS said that she is definitely looking forward to a win by Kochi Tuskers.

“It would be a facelift for our city, if the side performs well under the captainship of Mahela Jayawardene,” she said.

But for young engineering talents like Vijesh Balakrishnan, final year student of the Electronics and Communication Engineering batch at MEC, the chances of watching IPL live are minimal, as the university examinations are on.

“A few of my friends would love to see the match but many of us would be busy with the examinations,” he said.

B. Rakesh of SCMS said that Sreesanth will make a great comeback in IPL “because in the last match we saw him bowling a few good balls in a batting pitch. I suggest that he work on his last overs, as he is losing confidence towards the end,” he said.
