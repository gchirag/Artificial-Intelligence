 Mohammad Ajmal Amir Kasab, lone surviving gunman of the 26/11 attacks, has moved a mercy petition praying for clemency against the death sentence awarded to him by the trial court, affirmed by the Bombay High Court and upheld by the Supreme Court. The plea has been forwarded to President Pranab Mukherjee .

A.C. Rane, Superintendent of the Arthur Road Jail, where Kasab is lodged, told The Hindu. Kasab’s plea, written by him in Hindi, was forwarded to the President.

On August 29, the Supreme Court confirmed the death sentence awarded to him for waging war against India. His plea challenging the conviction was dismissed. A copy of the apex court’s verdict was given to Kasab in September first week.

Maharashtra Home Minister R.R. Patil said, “The Centre should take a decision promptly and ensure that Kasab is hanged with immediate effect. This crime [26/11] was of a different nature. It was a war on the country. Even the Supreme Court has said that. We will send a request for expediting the plea.”
