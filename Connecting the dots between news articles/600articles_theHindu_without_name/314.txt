 Success, power, progress, fearless, dynamism, resilience, aggression — all these attributes emblazoned in bold on the Deccan Chargers team bus — were left behind in the official vehicle itself, it seemed. For most of the season, these traits didn't quite carry over onto the ground for Chargers, the showing hardly setting the stands on fire.

And when these awe-inspiring words punctuated the local franchise's ads on the giant screen, they seemed so much like a lot of hot air, the irony just too good to miss.

Fans seem to be deserting Deccan Chargers, going by the number of spectators donning the apparel of rival teams, right here in Hyderabad. It could be the dismal run of the home side, destined for nowhere, or perhaps the prohibitively priced apparel that fans of the local franchise can ill-afford.

Consequently, the red and blue of the Delhi Daredevils and the jet black colours of the Pune Warriors caught the eye in recent times, rather than the host's midnight blue. Or is it that DC's supporters simply take no pride in the performance of their boys?

With little to cheer about, as action in the middle was hardly ‘charged,' spectators roared their approval when Sourav Ganguly stopped a speeding ball. That the former Indian captain has a following in this town, was evident even when he didn't have to do much to please the populace.

Elsewhere, a section of the crowd seemed more interested in the solo somersaults of a cheer girl, captured by a gleeful cameraman.

With defeat staring the home team in the face or when within hand-shaking distance, the chanting of the crowd was full-throated, when a couple of wickets fell as the contest drew to a close.

That the conclusion was a foregone one was not lost on a sportive audience. Yet it was quick on the draw when it came to applause, regardless of whether it was a wicket to celebrate or a boundary.
