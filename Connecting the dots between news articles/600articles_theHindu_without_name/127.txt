The get-together was attended by acting Consul-General of the U.S. Consulate General, Martha Haas and other officials from the diplomatic mission.

A few NRIs, businessmen, academics, government officials, students and media personnel were among those present on the occasion. Similar get-togethers were conducted elsewhere by US consulates in India.

A quiz conducted by the consulate officials saw enthusiastic participation from the invitees with many bagging prizes for correct answers.
