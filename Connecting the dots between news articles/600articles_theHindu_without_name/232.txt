NEW DELHI: A Delhi court on Thursday sent up Sukhdev Pehelwan, third accused in the Nitish Katara murder case, on trial under charges of kidnapping and murder and causing disappearance of evidence or giving false information.

Framing the charges against the accused, Additional Sessions Judge Ravinder Kaur said that prima facie there was sufficient evidence on record to send up the accused on trial.

The other two accused in the case are Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav, son and nephew of former Rajya Sabha member D.P. Yadav, respectively.

The prosecution's allegation against Vikas Yadav and Vishal Yadav is that they had kidnapped and later killed Nitish Katara as they were against Nitish having an affair with Bharti, daughter of D.P. Yadav.
