KADAPA: Allah Rakha Rahman, who created history by becoming the first Indian to bag two Oscar awards, visited the Ameen Peer Dargah in Kadapa, popularly known as Pedda Dargah, and offered special prayers on Friday, the concluding day of the three-day Hazrath Khwaja Syed Sha Ameenullah Malik Urs.

The music maestro’s mother, Kasturi, arrived at the Dargah by car around 4 a.m. and Mr. Rahman arrived by 5 a.m. The ancient Dargah was agog with devotees, mediapersons and onlookers enthusiastically awaiting the arrival of the music director. Police organised heavy bandobust to control the crowds.

Offers fateha

Sporting a white pyjama and red kurtha and donning a traditional white Taj cap, Mr. Rahman called on the Peethadhipathi Hazrath Khwaja Syed Sha Arifullah Mohammed Mohammed-ul Hussaini Chisti-ul Khadri and took his blessings. The fakirs carried the floral offering, while Mr. Rahman and the Peethadhipathi walked into the main dargah amid drumbeats and offered Tehleel fateha at the tomb of Hazrath Khwaja Syed Sha Ameenullah Malik and presented a chaadar, a golden zari cloth. He placed the Oscar award insignia at the Dargah.

Mr. Rahman, who spoke to mediapersons later, said he was visiting the Dargah often for spiritual guidance and to seek the blessings of the Almighty.

He was blessed with mental peace whenever he visited the Dargah, he said, adding that the Dargah has a special place in his heart and he has immense faith in it. People of Kadapa were fortunate to have the Pedda Dargah, the music maestro said. Expressing pleasure over winning two Oscars, Mr. Rahman said the awards were an honour for all the music artistes of the country.
