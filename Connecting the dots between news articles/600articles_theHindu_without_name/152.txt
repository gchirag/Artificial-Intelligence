Beverly Hills: A.R. Rahman on Thursday became the first Indian to get three Oscar nominations, even as the British-Indian movie Slumdog Millionaire which brought him these was nominated for seven other categories including best picture and best director. The film, with its rags-to-riches theme, came second in terms of number of nominations after The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with 13 scores.

Rahman was nominated for Best Original Score. The numbers ‘Jai Ho’ and ‘O Saya’ were short-listed for Best Original Song, Rahman sharing the honour with Gulzar in the case of the former and with Maya Arulpragasam in the latter.

Close on the heels of the dual-language film winning four Golden Globes, including one for Rahman, earlier this month, Danny Boyle and Simon Beaufoy were short-listed for best director and best adapted screenplay.

On the eve of its official premiere in India on Friday, the film also won nominations in cinematography, sound mixing, sound editing and film editing. Along with the two tunes from Slumdog Millionaire, the third song nominated was one co-written by Peter Gabriel for the animated WALL-E. The film had dominated the Golden Globes, sweeping all four of its categories, including best drama and best director.

Among the 13 nominations that the romantic fantasy The Curious Case of Benjamin Button grabbed were those for best picture and acting honours for Brad Pitt and Taraji P. Henson, and a directing slot for David Fincher.

Other best-picture nominees are Frost/Nixon, Milk, and The Reader. Kate Winslet was nominated for lead actress for The Reader and shut out for Revolutionary Road.

Actors considered longshots also sneaked in, among them lead-actor nominee Richard Jenkins for The Visitor, and best-actress contender Melissa Leo for Frozen River.
