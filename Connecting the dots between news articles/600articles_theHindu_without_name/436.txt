Team Anna member Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday that social activist Anna Hazare's agitation in the five poll-bound States — Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Manipur, Punjab and Goa — will depend on his health. Last week, Mr. Hazare had to end his three-day fast abruptly in Mumbai due to failing health.

Mr. Kejriwal visited Mr. Hazare, who is still suffering from chest congestion and is admitted to the Sancheti hospital, on Monday. “The future course of action and the agitation depends entirely on his health and suggestions by doctors,” he told reporters.

The Hindu had reported on Sunday that Mr. Hazare would not be able to undertake the tour of the five States at least for another month, as his doctors had advised him against it. “Anna's health is paramount for us and the whole country,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

Mr. Hazare had announced in Mumbai that he would tour the five poll-bound States to propagate against political parties that opposed a strong Lokpal Bill in Parliament.

Dr. Parag Sancheti, who accompanied Mr. Kejriwal, said Mr. Hazare would be administered intravenous antibiotics for five days. “He is not allowed to fast, or undertake any stressful activity for a month,” he stated.
