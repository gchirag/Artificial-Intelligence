Does Osama's death mark the end of terrorism? We all know the answer to the question. The true weapon against terrorism is a strong anti-terrorism team, the elimination of the existing network, and empathy for all. An eye for an eye may give instant solution but it will, in no way, put a stop to the raging war of terror. Every terror group is backed by a group of young, intelligent people. Every year, every month, a new batch of militants is incubated and dragged into the network. Why do militant groups look so attractive for the young? How do they manage to find new people every day?' Maybe we, the young, lack empathy for fellow feelings. We also give up easily, lose hope, lose faith, and gradually build up hatred — for everything and everyone. How easily we are taken in! It is time to wake up.
