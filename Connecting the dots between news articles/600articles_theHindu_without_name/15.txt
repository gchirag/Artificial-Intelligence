 Four former stars of world cricket failed to pick up a favourite but agreed that the best fielding side will take the title in the upcoming ICC World Cup.

A panel comprising three former World Cup captains — Kapil Dev, Steve Waugh and Sourav Ganguly — and one of the game's most celebrated batsmen Sir Vivian Richards discussed a range of topics related to the cricket World Cup, in a programme here on Sunday evening.

“Whichever side wins this World Cup is going to be the best fielding side,” former Australian captain Waugh said.

Kapil Dev said the team under Mahendra Singh Dhoni has the form and the ability to win it. Sourav Ganguly reiterated his earlier stand that there cannot be a favourite in the present context. “The only two occasions when a team was called a favourite were the sides captained by Clive Lloyd (the West Indies of 1975 and 1979) and Steve Waugh (1999). I don't think any other team ever could justify the favourite's tag,” said Ganguly.

Viv Richards said his country has not done anything noteworthy in the run-up to the World Cup to be able to convince the pundits about it being a favourite but the team has enough talent to win the title.

Kapil Dev sounded critical when he was asked about the ongoing the campaign in the country that says ‘win it for Sachin'.

Said, “winning the World Cup cannot be a single man's dream. It is more about realising the collective dream of a team and a nation.

“When everyone's saying ‘bring this World Cup for Sachin (Tendulkar)', I would say Sachin will bring the Cup for us,” he added with a note of humour.
