G.V. Ramanjaneyulu, Director of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, has said that farmers' suicides have been grossly under-assessed in the State. According to him, 95 farmers ended their lives between October 7 and November 8 in six districts.

Dr. Ramanjaneylu, who is also heading the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, and was here to conduct a public hearing on “farmers' suicides”, said farmers' deaths were one of the biggest tragedies of the 21st century. During the current year around 2,500 people committed suicide in the State and majority of them were farmers. As per the newspaper reports 500 to 600 farmers died in various districts.

He said Medak, Adilabad, Karimnagar, Mahabubnagar and Anantapur were the worst-hit areas. Dr. Ramanjaneylu felt that the governments and society had stopped thinking of dying farmers long ago. Even though a farmer committed suicide, the officials tried to hush up the incident by showing other reasons for the suicide. He criticised the procedure laid down for identifying a farm suicide saying the complex rules ended up determining a suicide as non-farm death. Behind the death of every farmer the prime motivating factor was misery brought by the agriculture, he said. He analysed that farmers suffered on two counts - due to crop failure and lack of remunerative prices. Farmers were hit by one of the crisis every season. In a year of bumper crop, the prices tumbled and in a year of good prices there is no crop.

He urged the government to provide remunerative prices and compensation to farmers. He was critical of the functioning of the banks, which met only 27 per cent of the investment needs of the farmers, while the rest was borrowed from the money-lenders.
