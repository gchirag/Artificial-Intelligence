Accusing Mayawati government of stifling centrally-sponsored schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said that Congress can ensure development only after it comes into power in the State.

“Programmes are being chalked out in Delhi, but here problems are being faced in their implementation. Frankly, without having a government in U.P., it is not easy to carry out development works,” Mr. Gandhi said while addressing a function in constituency.

“We will make an effort to form a government in U.P., then both the governments will work in tandem,” said the Congress general secretary who has been leading a campaign to revive the party in the crucial State where the Congress has been out of power for over two decades.

Mr. Gandhi alleged that the benefits of welfare schemes were not reaching the targeted population in Uttar Pradesh.

“Earlier there was shortage of funds for development works, but it is not so now. The problem is that the benefits are not reaching the needy,” Mr. Gandhi said.

He said that adequate funds are provided by the Centre for roads, but the projects are not carried out properly due to corruption.

“First of all the roads are not constructed and if they are constructed they get damaged in six month as the contractors play mischief,” he said.

The Congress leader said that it hurts when development works were stifled by the U.P. government.

“We work our heart out and it really hurts when they are stopped by the U.P. government,” he said.

Citing example of the proposed Hindustan paper mill, Mr. Gandhi claimed that the project was pending with the State government for the last two years.

“The project, which could have given job to nearly 10,000 people, is pending with the State government for clearance,” he said.

Mr. Gandhi said that a lot of work has been done in MNREGA, health and education sector and efforts were being made to do more in future.
