 Senior BJP leader L.K. Advani on Wednesday said Pakistan’s “dual face” stood fully exposed after the U.S. strike on the hideout of dreaded terrorist Osama Bin Laden in that country.

“We have been constantly emphasising that Pakistan is aiding and abetting terrorism but killing of dreaded terrorist Osama Bin Laden in US strikes on his hideout in Pakistan has vindicated our stand and it has been established beyond doubt that he was given shelter by Pakistan,” Mr. Advani told reporters here.

“On the one hand Pakistan is overtly cooperating with America in stamping out terrorism but on the other is giving shelter to terrorists like Osama. The world community must take cognisance of this,” he said.

Referring to BJP affairs in party-ruled states Punjab and Himachal Pradesh, Mr. Advani said everything was fine and there was no problem.
