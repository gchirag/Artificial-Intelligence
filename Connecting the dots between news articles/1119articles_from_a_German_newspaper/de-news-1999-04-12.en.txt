Special party rally of the SPD: Schroeder elected as chairman
</H1>
As expected, Chancellor Schroeder had been elected as new
chairman on the Special party rally of the SPD. Schroeder is the
successor of Oskar Lafontaine, who resigned in March. Schroeder
received 76 percent of the valid votes, 21 percent of the delegates
voted against him. After a partly very emotional debate, the SPD
special party rally favored the course of the Federal Government in
the conflict in the Kosovo. Chancellor Schroeder said, that never
again deportation and murder would be politically allowed. Party
internal critics warned Schroeder of putting the confidence in
Germany's calculability and trustworthiness at stake. The delegates
approved a proposition of the party board, that aims at a peaceful
solution. But the end of the NATO-attacks on Yugoslavia depends on a
positive reaction of the political leaders in Belgrade. There was no
majority for a proposition of left wing party members for an
immediate stop of the air attacks.
