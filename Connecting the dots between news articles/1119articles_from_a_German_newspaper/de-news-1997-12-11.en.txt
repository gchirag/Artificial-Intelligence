Germany Disapproves Results of Climate Conference
</H1>
Germany will accede to the Kyoto climate treaty only under certain
conditions. After the close of negotiations Environment Minister Angela
Merkel
declared in Kyoto Germany only ratifies the treaty if there will be a
satisfying solution for the trade of emmission certificates. The Kyoto
compromise provides for the sale of emmission quotas to other states by
those states where reduction of emmission exceeds agreed-upon norms.
Environmentalists criticize this as a trade of pollution rights. Key
point of the protocoll is the commitment to reduce green house gases by
5.2%. Basis for assessment are the amounts of the year 1990. The
reduction shall be achieved in the years 2008 to 2012.

Small Businesses Fear Consumption Drop Due to Tax Raise
</H1>
Small business owners are in uproar over the tax raise. They fear a
further drop in consumption, and are afraid that they cannot raise
prices without losing consumers. Economy analysts support this view.
Especially home delivery services are getting in trouble, because their
spring and summer catalogues have already been printed. Thus prices are
set. These businesses will have to either print new catalogues or live
with smaller profit margines.

Bundestag Passes New Less Bureaucratic Budget Law
</H1>
The Bundestag changed budget law for federal, state and local
governments. From the year 1998 on administration of tax revenues shall
be less bureaucratic. The measure gives an end to the so-called December
fever. Until now, at the end of the year administrative offices have
been throwing out funds hectically only in order to keep the budget from
shrinking in the following year. If they had saved the money, they would
not have received the same amount for the next year. Starting in 1998
the administration services can keep funds that have not been spent, and
take them into the new budget. This new regulation is to give public
servants the chance to personally take responsibility for citizens' tax
deutschmarks.

</H1>

of Finance Theo Waigel's new advances towards tax reform. SPD
financial specialist Poss said in Bonn that Waigel is just
presenting his tax plans - that SPD considers financially
unbearable - in new packaging with a view to upcoming
elections. In Poss's opinion, there is no factual progress at all
contained therein. The finance minister had announced
his intention of presenting a revised plan early next year.
It would fix the initial income tax level at 20% and the top
level at 47%. For counterfinancing, value added tax would
be increased by another percentage point, among others.

Rhineland-Palatinate for centralized sales procedure for sporting event transmission rights
</H1>
Rhineland-Palatinate intends not to take the Superior Court decision
against the centralized sale of TV-transmission rights for soccer matches.
State premier Beck announced in Mainz that an initiative would be taken to
change the anti-trust code. He intends to discuss this matter with the
heads of the other state governments. In Beck's opinion, this sales
procedure should prevail in the future because socially important
activities depended on the income from it. The Superior Court had today
decided to prohibit sale of these rights through the German Soccer
Association. This decision initially refers to Europe Cup games only. The
court found that individual clubs were entitled to sell the rights. The
procedures as practiced up to now were found to infringe the anti-trust
code.
