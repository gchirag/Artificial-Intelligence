CDU leadership largely approves tax reform
</H1>
Christian-Democratic Party (CDU) leadership has largely
approved the planned tax reform. After further discussions, it will be made
public next Thursday. It seems to be clear that the involved parties have
agreed on a tax bracket starting at less than 19%, and with a maximum tax
rate of 39%. Now, the tax bracket starts at 25.9%. As before, the tax rate
will progress linearly within the bracket.

<P>
Federal Construction Minister Klaus Toepfer said gains from real estate
sales will remain tax free. It is, however, possible that the
anti-speculation period [i.e. the minimal period of time the real estate
has to be kept before selling it] will increase from two to seven years.
After a meeting at the Chancellor's Office, CDU secretary-general Peter
Hintze said a revision of the entire income tax law will be worked out.

<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel has already made clear yesterday that the
Value Added Tax [or Goods and Services Tax] will increase to 16%. Within
the coalition, though, the scale of the VAT increase still seems to be
under discussion.

German-Czech reconciliation treaty signed
</H1>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav
Havel signed today the German-Czech reconciliation treaty. Fifty years
after the end of WW II, this document puts into words both countries'
opinions on their common past.
Therein, Germany regrets the crimes committed against Czech people during
the nazi era, while the Czech Republic does so for the expulsion of
Sudete Germans after WW II.
The agreement is also a commitment to a trusting cooperation in
the future.

<P>
The reconciliation treaty is not undisputed, though. The Organisation of
Sudete Germans criticised the fact that neither their right of residence
[in the Czech Republic] nor their demands for restitution of expropriated
property are guaranteed by the treaty. On the other hand, the agreement
does not accord Czech victims of the Nazi regime the individual
indemnification they demanded.

<P>
Helmut Kohl called upon Germans and Czechs to reconciliate and to
cooperate.

Reemstma testifies in kidnapping trial
</H1>
In the trial against his alleged kidnappers, Hamburg
multi-billionaire Philipp Reemtsma testified today. Mr Reemtsma,
44 years old, had already described the kidnapping from the victim's point
of view in his book "Im Keller" ("In the basement").

<P>
During the first three days of the trial, the two defendants, Wolfgang
Kossetsch (sp?) and Peter Richter, gave detailed accounts of the
kidnapping. Both have admitted their participation in the crime.

<P>
Today, the trial was planned to center on the victim. The multi-billionaire
had been summoned as a witness to testify about details of the kidnapping
and of the five weeks he was detained as a hostage. But even before today,
his testimony had been disputed since he had taken part in all proceedings
of the trial in a third party action. Moreover, he had already written
down his thoughts and feelings in a most detailed way in his book.
Therefore, an unprejudiced testimony was no longer possible, said
Mr Richter's lawyer.

Case of BSE in Germany
</H1>
A new case of mad cow disease (BSE) appeared in Germany, the
first since 1994. An ox that died in Hoexter, Westfalen, had suffered
from the disease, according to test results of the Federal office for
virus infections in Tuebingen. The Galloway was descended from a cow
that had been imported from Great Britain.
The authorities now want to decide on the question of whether all cattle
imported from Great Britain should be killed. This would concern some
3,000 to 5,000 animals.
The origins of BSE disease have been traced back to transmittance to
calves during pregnancy and feeding of ground up animal by-products.

No tuition fees in Baden-Wuerttemberg for the time being
</H1>
From the coming Spring semester, students at universities in
Baden-Wuerttermberg will have to pay enrolment fees of Dm100 per semester.
Those who do not pay will be exmatriculated, said Science Minister,
Mr Trotha today. This rule will also be applied to students who paid the
money into accounts that were put in place by the student representations
but cannot be tapped by the university administrations.
Mr Trotha rejects any negotiations with the student representations about
the money paid into these accounts. The enrolment fees were no tution fees,
and no tuition fees would be introduced in Baden-Wuerttemberg during
the ongoing legislative period, he added. It is still unclear, though, how
universities will be financed in the next few years.
