Former DDR judges acquitted on charges of abusing the law
</H1>
Two high-ranking judges of the former German Democratic Republic were
acquitted on charges of inciting circumvention of the law. The accused had
developed guidelines in their capacities as vice president of the highest
court of the GDR and chairman of the council for work matters. The charges
concerned pressuring citizens who wanted to leave the country by getting
them fired from their jobs. The criminal court in Berlin referenced
decisions of Federal High Court in making the acquittal. They required
extremely glaring examples of arbitrary behavior to obtain a judgment in
work related cases. Proof of rather undemocratic behavior is not
sufficient. The chief judge, Braeutigam stressed that the court was
following precedence, but reluctantly so, as no justice is rendered to
those who were victimized.

Unsanctioned employees in the offices of the European Parliament
</H1>
Apparently there are people working off the record in the offices of the
European Parliament. Or at least that was the claim made today by the
Parliamentary Employees Union. One in five persons working in the offices
of the EU members of parliament in Strasbourg are working without a union
contract, they said, many earning less that 1200 DM per month. The union
called for an examination the actual purposes for which the EU members of
parliament are spending their personnel budgets of 18,000 DM per month.

Environmental Minister still sees end to nuclear power generation
</H1>
Environmental Minister Trittin still regards a compromise solution for the
abandonment of nuclear power generation as possible, although the most
recent high-level conference at the Chancellor's office showed there were
still divergent positions. However, the key points for a consensus on
energy policy could be agreed upon by the time parliament goes into summer
recess, said Trittin on the "ZDF Morning Magazine" television program. It
would be a complete package outlining remaining run times for plants,
waste disposal plans, and mixes of power generation sources. There are
also differences of opinion in the power generation industry as to whether
the consensus talks should be continued.

Employment Minister Riester calls for further pension increases
</H1>
According to a plan by Employment Minister Riester, pensions in eastern
and western Germany would be increased by a greater amount this year than
they were last year. According to government sources in Bonn, Riester's
proposal calls for an increase of around 1.34% in the former West German
states, and around 2.79% in the former East German states. The cabinet
will make a decision regarding the proposal on March 31st. The cabinet has
approved a bill that provides uniform regulation to development of the
elder care system across Germany. The law would enter into force in 2000,
but must first be approved by the Bundestag and Bundesrat.

Schroeder calls for business community involvement in Expo2000
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder has called for stronger involvement from the business
community in Hanover's Expo2000. At a meeting with industry
representatives this evening in Bonn, Schroeder said the project was a
chance to positively influence the world's image of Germany, and
businesses could profit from that.

<P>
The Chancellor would not address newspaper reports saying that he had
threatened his resignation at a cabinet meeting today. According to
information from several papers, Schroeder criticized his governing team
for engaging in anti-business politics in defiance of the majority of
Germany's population. He is said to have been especially critical of
Finance Minister Lafontaine and his Green Party coalition partners.

Funke and Fischler present new compromise on agriculture reform
</H1>
Federal Agriculture Minister Funke and the EU Commissioner responsible for
agriculture, Franz Fischler, have submitted a new compromise paper on
agricultural reform. According to the proposal up to a quarter of the
direct subsidies from the EU for agriculture would be financed from
national budgets -- this will save Germany a billion DM. Further
recommendations include limiting the expenditures for the EU's agriculture
budget to approximately 40.5 billion Euros per year. The prices for some
agricultural products will be gradually lowered as much as 20%. A quota
system for milk production would be in place through the year 2006.
