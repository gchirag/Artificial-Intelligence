Employers in Baden-Wuerttemberg's metal sector against full sick pay
</H1>
Employers in the metal sector of the district of North
Wuerttemberg/North Baden reject 100% sick pay. They criticised the
bargaining agreement in Lower Saxony. The cost level would be too
high for the companies because the agreement disregards that remuneration
should of course take into account the work hours missed due to illness.
Therefore, employers of the district of North Wuerttemberg/North Baden want
to continue negotiations with the IG Metall union soon.

<P>
Meanwhile in the district of South Baden-Wuerttemberg, negotiations seem
to be more successful. The commissions of both sides, though, still have to
agree on details of the bargaining agreement including full
sick pay.

No agreement between Lufthansa and DAG union yet
</H1>
Collective bargaining negotiations between the DAG union
and Lufthansa have been suspended without results last night.
Consequently, flying personnel and ground personnel will stage a limited
walkout on Thursday.

<P>
According to the DAG union, Lufthansa's executive board still rejects
to offer pay rises in the usual scale for next year. The management wants
to reach a similar agreement as the one already accepted by the OeTV union.
According to this agreement, employees get a one-time payment of 33%
of the monthly salary before March 1997, and a pay rise of 1.7% in 1998.

<P>
Lufthansa offers all their customers who have booked a long-distance flight
on Thursday to change their bookings of inner-German flights to
Wednesday without extra fees.

DGB union expects more than four million unemployed persons in winter
</H1>
The national trade union federation (DGB) expects the number
of unemployed in Germany to reach at least four million this month. DGB's
deputy head Ursula Engelen-Kefer said in a newspaper interview a new high since
WW II could be reached by the end of the month. Ms Engelen-Kefer blames
government failures for the problem - the coalition government again
and again cuts funds of the Federal Labour Office and thus increases
unemployment.

Coalition parties debate planned tax reform
</H1>
The coalition government needs more time to decide on all details
of the planned income tax reform. Despite earlier plans to announce them
before Christmas, discussions will now be finished by the end of January,
said head of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos.
The FDP is optimistic that experts will at least agree on the corner
stones of the tax reform by Christmas, in particular the minimum and the
maximum income tax rate. The main problem is the compensation for this tax cut
of some Dm80bn. Therefore the coalition government plans to cut tax
privileges rigorously. FDP head Wolfgang Gerhardt rejects increases of
other taxes.

<P>
FDP and CDU/CSU quarrel again over when to decide on the decrease of
the solidarity surcharge tax. The Liberal Democrats insist on taking
this decision by the end of this month, while CDU/CSU do not want to decide
on the matter before having figured out all the details of the tax reform.

Kinkel wants special NATO partnership for Russia and Ukraine
</H1>
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel demands a special NATO partnership
for Russia and Ukraine. A security concept for Europe could not be built
against but only with these two countries, said Kinkel in a newspaper
interview. The foreign ministers of NATO's member states debate today
the admission of new members.

New peace troops for Bosnia
</H1>
The foreign minister of NATO's member states approved today
the conception for a new employment of peace troops in Bosnia. Germany
will send more than 3,000 of a total of 30,000 troops that will oversee
the implementation of the Dayton peace accord. The UN security council
still has to approve the mission, though.
The UN mandate for the NATO commanded IFOR mission ends December 20.

SPD approves deployment of German troops but boycotts parliamentary voting
</H1>
The SPD faction in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament)
approves the deployment of German troops for NATO's peace mission in
Bosnia but it will nonetheless boycott the parliamentary voting on the
matter. The faction decided unanimously that it was necessary to wait with
the voting until the UN security council approves the mission. This, however,
will not happen before Friday morning. Therefore, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
asked the Bundestag to take a preliminary decision to avoid a special
session next week.

Reactions to German-Czech declaration
</H1>
The Federation of Sudete-Germans has heavily criticised the
German-Czech declaration that was published yesterday. On the other hand,
FDP and Greens signaled approval.
The Head of the Federation of Sudete-Germans, Mr Neubauer, called the text
unacceptable since the expulsion of Sudete-Germans after WW II by the
Czech Republic is not pronounced wrong. According to Mr Neubauer, the
declaration does not even consider any measures for reparation.
In particular, the Sudete-Germans demand the right to live in the Czech
Republic.

<P>
Head of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos does not want to exclude
the possibility of rejecting the treaty. The CSU is the party that backs
the Sudete-Germans most strongly. Mr Glos wants that as many as possible
of the demands of the Sudete-Germans will be met.

<P>
On the other hand, FDP head Wolfgang Gerhardt and politician of the
Greens Antje Vollmer praise the declaration as a great achievement for
appeasement.

<P>
Czech Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Wondra (sp?), called the declaration
an important contribution to the future cooperation of both states.

<P>
Bavaria's State Premier Edmund Stoiber does not consider the German-Czech
talks to be finished. He assumes that before paraphing the contract
on December 20 in Prague it will again be discussed within the coalition
in Bonn.

<P>
Germany's Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel regretted that the text of the
declaration had been published early. At the meeting of NATO's foreign
ministers in Brussels he said he will not comment on the declaration before
it has been signed.

Bargaining round stopped in Bremen
</H1>
The bargaining negotiations for the metal sector in Northern
Germany seem to be harder than expected. The talks in Bremen are still
suspended. The Head of IG-Metall district Kueste (coast),
Mr Teichmueller, said opinions of employers and employees are still far
away from each other. Employers have questioned an already existing agreement.
According to this agreement, employees' representatives
can demand a decrease of working hours if employees were fired otherwise.

Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg want highway vignette
</H1>
 The states of Bavaria and of Baden-Wuerttemberg want to introduce
a highway vignette for cars and small lorries. The vignette would cost
Dm80. The Dm2.5bn raised by the vignette are to be used only for road
construction. This is the result of the first joint cabinet meeting of
both state governments.
