More and more aliens leave Germany
</H1>
The federal statistical office published new data on immigration
and emigration of aliens this morning. They show that last year
the number of resident aliens leaving Germany exceeded the number
of new arrivals.. Altogether, 637.000 aliens left the Federal
Republic, almost 80.000 more than in the previous year, while only
615.000 moved into Germany, 93.000 less than before. Nevertheless
the total number of resident aliens in the 16 states has
increased, a fact that statisticians ascribe to the high birth
rate the group shows.

Bavarian state government threatens Munich
</H1>
The Free State of Bavaria might cancel the subsidies paid the
state capital for asylum applicants. The ministry for social
affairs wants thereby to protest against the Munich practice of
giving the applicants money instead of material support.
Department head Stamm said that Munich must once and for all obey
the law against the misuse of subsidies. In Munich, asylum
applicants can buy their own food and health and body care
products.

morning that 5,000 new employees will be needed this year.

Complaints against fiscal federalism filed
</H1>
Negotiations re-structuring the fiscal federalism procedures led
to no result. Now  Bavaria and Baden-W=FCrttemberg have filed their
long announced constitutional complaint. They want to attain a
procedural change in order to lessen the burden on giver-states. A
decision is expected for next year. The two Southern states are
not willing to accept having to hand over (as the current
regulation provides) 80% of their above normal tax-revenues poorer
states. The plaintiffs propose reducing this level to 50%.
Bavarian finance-minister Huber, talking to the official Bavarian
radio station, again criticized the existing regulations as being
unfair and discouraging.

Reduction of social security contributions
</H1>
The federal employment office continues believing that pension
fund contributions can be lowered next year by about 0,1%.
Admittedly, the social security system revenues during the first 6
months of 1998 were lower were lower than last year's by DM 1.5
billion, but this had not come as a surprise, it had been foreseen
in the latest budget review. This statement is a denial of a
report by the daily "Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung". The paper,
based on data received from the VDR [Association of Social
Security Insurers], had announced that due to reduced revenue in
the first 6 months of 1998, the announced reduction of
contributions for 1999 might possibly not be implemented.
Meanwhile, VDR has confirmed that the data weren't all that new
and had already been included in the federal government's social
security report. Parting exactly from this base, the federal
government had announced a .1% reduction of contributions for
1999. Spokespersons for both the ministry of labor and the VDR
stated that the Hannover paper's report must not be interpreted as
meaning a new and recently discovered loss of revenue in the DM
billion range  One thing is certain: Nobody can say with absolute
certainty, at this date, exactly what will be the contribution
level next year. Unless a turnaround of the negative trend of the
first six months occurs in the fall, even a minimum lowering of
contributions will not be possible.

Five year sentence for "Tatort" TV series actor
</H1>
Actor Ernst Hannawald has been sentenced to five years in custody
on grounds of two of armed robbery. The Munich Regional Court #1
pronounced the 38 year old actor guilty on two counts of severe
predatory extortion. At the same time, the court ordered his
internment in a drug rehabilitation center. The sentence is in
line with the prosecution's demand. The judge assessed the two
raids, which brought the actor DM 25,000 within 24 hours from a
Munich post office and a savings bank branch, as two counts of
heavy predatory extortion without aggravating circumstances.
