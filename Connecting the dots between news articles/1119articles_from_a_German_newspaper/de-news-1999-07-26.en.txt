Capital gains tax apparently not to be reintroduced
</H1>
The Ministry of Finance seems to plan not to reintroduce the capital
gains tax. A spokesperson for the ministry said that the states would
have to agree on it first. In addition, the government is aiming at
reducing taxes.
The social democrats continue showing different views on capital gains
tax. After the State Premiers of Schleswig-Holstein and Saarland,
Simonis and Klimt, had already spoken out in favor of it, the SPD
secretary-general Schreiner now supports the attempt, too. According
to Schreiner, this would support the social balance of the savings
package.
State Premier of Lower-Saxony, Glogowski, and Bremen's mayor Scherf,
both SPD, turned down the plans. Scherf said on Deutschlandfunk, that
the introduction of a new tax would be counter-productive.
The finance expert of Buendnis 90/Greens, Scheel, also spoke against a
capital gains tax.

Environmental minister plans nationwide speed limits during smog
</H1>
Beginning next year, drivers in Germany will have to adjust to nationwide speed limits during summer smog. The federal government considers
the current driving restrictions for vehicles without catalytic converters during high ozone concentrations to be insufficient, according
to a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Environment in Berlin.
Department head Trittin said again in the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" to
replace the driving restrictions with speed limits beginning with the
year 2000 in anticipation of an EU guideline. According to the politician from the Green Party, trucks would have to follow a speed limit
of 60 km/h on the autobahn and 50 km/h on highways during ozone warning
states, and passenger cars would be restricted to 100 km/h on the autobahn and 80 km/h on highways.
The Federal Department for the Environment supports these plans. A
spokesperson for the department said that a large-scale speed limit
should be set for everyone beginning with 180 micrograms of ozone per
cubic meter of air.
Automobile clubs and the federation of freight transportation, on the
other hand, warned against such a new traffic management scheme.

Gerhardt favors limiting pension plan contributions to 20%
</H1>
FDP leader Gerhardt spoke out in favor of freezing the pension plan
contributions at 10% of gross income. In an interview with "Berliner
Zeitung," Gerhardt said that this could be done through the planned
large pension reform. The tolerable limit is said to be 20%. At the
same time, the pension level should be reduced from its current value
of almost 70% to 65%. Private provisions would have to become the
second form of support next to legal pension plans.
According to their chairperson, the Free Democrats are ready to discuss the pension plan reform with the federal government. However,
SPD and Greens would have to correct the mistake made by Labor
Minister Riester to turn the pension plan level into an arbitrary
parameter of the federal budget.

Search for Zurwehme continues through the night
</H1>
100 police continued searching for the criminal Dieter Zurwehme during
the night. The police now assumes that he is armed with a pistol and a
knife. Despite a large-scale manhunt during the day, there are no clues
as to the whereabouts of Zurwehme. Officers searched a wooden area
between North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower-Saxony after receiving more
than 100 tips from the population. 40 officers were dealing with a
tip from Brandenburg. Zurwehme escaped from prison last December and
is said to have murdered two couples in Remagen in March by shooting
them.

Fee for use of border patrol troops at railway stations
</H1>
Railway customers may have to pay a so-called security fee. The newspaper "Die Welt" reports that the federal government is asking the
federal railways to pay 260 million German marks for the use of border
patrol troops at railway stations. The costs could be shifted to the
customer. A spokesperson for the federal reailways said to the newspaper that these fees could not easily be handled. It would then be
questionable whether the use of border patrol as railway police could
continue as before.

Price dumping by major retail chains under investigation
</H1>
The federal anti-trust office is investigating the price dumping by
major retail chains. The office wants to check first whether the retail
chain Rewe sold goods below costs, thus commiting price dumping. The
owners of small businesses in Lower-Saxony complained to the anti-trust
office about the low-price offers by the retail chain. They hold these
offers to be price dumpings.
During the last week, the major retail chains continued to underbid
each other using special sales. Even the managers of large companies
spoke about a dramatic price war.
