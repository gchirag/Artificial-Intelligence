Federal minister of defense visits Israel
</H1>
The federal minister of defense, Ruehe, traveled to Israel today. He is the
first member of the federal government to meet with the new State premier
Netanjahu. Subjects of the discussions were the peace efforts in the Middle
East and the concern of the EU that Israel's new land settlement policy could
destroy the recent progress. Meanwhile, the peace effort seems to continue. It
is now confirmed that Israelis and Palestinians have met in secret over the
past two weeks and the word is that these contacts between close advisors of
Netanjahu and Arafat are close to be concluded. The path for the first personal
meeting between Netanjahu and Arafat would be cleared. State premier Netanjahu,
who has so far refused to meet with Arafat, indicated over the weekend that he
is now willing to do so. It is expected that Netanjahu and Arafat will meet
within the next days to try to overcome the stagnation in the peace efforts
for the Middle East.

Federal cabinet deliberates in Bonn

although some special privileges will remain. SPD and the tenants association
therefore reject the draft. The cabinet also discussed the globalization of
the economy and its effects on German research policy.

Kohl discusses apprenticeship calamity with economic representatives
</H1>
Everybody willing to start job training should receive an apprenticeship,
according to the federal government. However, there are still numerous high
school graduates who do not have one. Chancellor Kohl is now personally trying
to persuade employers to provide training beyond their own needs. Kohl is
meeting with leading associations of independent businesses and industry this
week. Today he met with the managers and presidents of the chambers of
commerce. The topic of their discussion was not so much the question of how
many vacant apprenticeships are needed, but to find a general solution for the
problem of providing enough opportunities for the coming age groups with a high
birth rate. One thing is clear after the education summit last year: The
chancellor is not willing to rely on the promises made by the employers. Too
big is the danger that someone has to run after these promises year by year.
Subjects of discussion were two suggestions for a solution: Decrease of the
salary for trainees or an apprenticeship fee for businesses that do not provide
training. Lower salaries and a shorter vocational training are the key to more
vacancies according to a survey performed by the chamber of commerce in
Rhineland-Palatine, fees are the suggestion made by the DGB (German federation
of unions). Both ideas have been rejected by the employers as well as by the
federal minister for education, Ruettgers. Remaining is the chambers of
commerce's suggestion to allow apprentice wages of up to 30 percent below the
wage agreement, a suggestion that will result in vehement discussions with the
unions. According to a 1991 Federal Constitutional Court decision, an
ppropriate salary cannot be more than 20 percent lower than the wage agreement.

DGB presents principle paper for planned tax reform
</H1>
In the paper, the DGB (German federation of unions) demands,
among other things, an increase of the basic tax-free income to DM 15,000 and
child benefits based on corresponding rates of social welfare assistance. The
initial tax rate should not be higher than 20 percent. Starting in 1997, a socalled "energy tax" should be raised, which would help finance the unemployment
insurance. The DGB is willing to agree to an increase of the value added tax,
but only if that would result in a relief for the social welfare budgets.

Social democrats pass tax concept
</H1>
The SPD Executive board decided on its own concept for a decrease of income
taxes. Planned are relieves with a volume of DM 50 billion which should go in
effect in 1998. According to the concept, the initial tax rate should be
lowered from the current 25.9 percent to 19.5 percent. A reduction of the top
tax rate could also be possible but that depends on the extent to which
subsidies can be cut. The social democrats also want to increase the basic free
allowance as. SPD leader Lafontaine told journalists in Bonn that it is the
intention of his party to simplify the tax law and to strengthen the purchasing
power. The current regulations are a burden for people in the medium income
group, whereas those with a high income could use various tax breaks.
