Health reforms slowly taking shape
</H1>
Apparently the reforms of the health sector are slowly beginning to take
shape. SPD and the Greens agreed on the first common ground at a meeting
behind closed doors. There are plans now to provide better treatment for
patients by close co-operation between stationary and non-stationary
care. The coalition parties also want to strengthen the position of the
family doctor, and they furthermore agreed on a positive list for drugs
public health insurers would pay for (probably axing what's *not* on the
list). The new rules will apply as of next year.

Confusion in Lower Saxony
</H1>
In Lower Saxony both sides agreed on accepting the Baden-Wuerttemberg
compromise for metal-workers, after recent arbitration there. It provides
for 3.2% more pay as of March, plus a one-off payment of 1% of a yearly
wage. For the months of January and February there will be lump-sum payments
of 350 marks each. Early last night, however, members of the Employers'
Federation, to everyone's surprise, declared:" We can't wear that, it's
too expensive for us." A final solution must be reached until 2 March.

Ex-RAF-terrorist to be released before time
</H1>
Approximately 21 years after the RAF kidnapped and killed Mr Martin Schleyer,
erstwhile president of the Employers' Federation, one of the four
perpetrators, Mr Stephan Wischniewski, will be released from prison. In 1981
he had received two life sentences. Now the Higher Regional Court in
Dusseldorf ruled that he had cut all ties with terrorism and wanted to stay
away from it for good. Mr Wischniewski will leave prison on 1 March

Rising danger of avalanches in the Alps
</H1>
After abundant snowfalls in the Alps there is renewed danger of avalanches,
reaching 4 points (on a scale of five) in the Bavarian Alps. Bavaria's
Environment Minister Schnappauf warned skiers: "Avalanches are
life-threatening". In Switzerland and Austria access-roads to many
ski-resorts are blocked by snow. Authorities think they will take at least
till Sunday to clear the access-roads to Adelboden and Grindelwald
(Switzerland). Currently about 20,000 tourists are marooned in the two
villages, so air-transport has been arranged to fly them out this weekend.
