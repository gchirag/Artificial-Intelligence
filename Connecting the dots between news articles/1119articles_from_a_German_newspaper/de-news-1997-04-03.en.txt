Kohl to run again in 1998 elections
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has voiced his intention to run again in the federal
parliamentary elections next year.  At his vacation retreat in Bad
Hofgastein in Austria, Mr. Kohl told the ARC TV station that he feels it
is his duty to stand for re-election, in view of the current political
challenges.  The Chancellor celebrates his 67th birthday today.  He said
his decision was motivated by a desire to contribute to the on-going
construction of European unity and the eastward expansion of NATO.  Mr.
Kohl also stressed the importance of the timely implementation of the
European Monetary Union in 1999.  Mr. Kohl has served as Chancellor since
October 1st 1982 - longer than any previous Chancellor of the Federal
Republic of Germany.

Political reactions to Kohl's decision to run again
</H1>
The parties of the government have welcomed Mr. Kohl's desire to run again
in the elections next year.  The head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group,
Mr. Schaeuble, said that Kohl could count on their support.  The FDP
chairman Mr. Gerhard explained that the Chancellor's decision paves the
way for a continuation of the Coalition.  The SPD and The Greens, however,
predicted that Mr. Kohl would lose in 1998.  The head of the SPD
parliamentary group, Mr. Scharping, declared Mr. Kohl's policies a
failure.  He went on to say that, in view of the highest unemployment and
the largest federal debt in the history of the Federal Republic of
Germany, the time has come for a change of power.  The Social Democrats
have declared their intention not to select their candidate before April
of next year.  The spokesman for the executive board of Alliance 90/The
Greens, Mr. Trittin, said that the population will now have the
opportunity to call the Chancellor to account and to vote him out of
office.

Discord between Germany and Turkey
</H1>
The friction between Germany and Turkey continues to increase.  Interior
Minister Kanther has called on the Turkish government to refute
immediately a statement by the Turkish Interior Minister Ms. Axena.
According to the semi-official Turkish news agency Anadolu, the Minister
had said with reference to the Germans: "They can't throw us out [of the
country], but now they burn us alive."  Mr. Kanther commented he considers
it incredible that a member of the Turkish government did actually say
this.  Mr.  Kanther called the fact that Ankara immediately refuted this
latest statement an act of great political significance.  The Turkish
Ambassador to Bonn was summoned to the Foreign Office.  Secretary of
State, Mr. von Ploetz, declared that it was unacceptable for official
Turkish agencies to contribute to prejudices and insinuations and to mount
attacks against the German government.

</H1>
The Interior Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Kniola, considers it
almost certain that the arson attack in Krefeld was not motivated by
racial hatred.  Mr. Kniola said that a number of facts and clues appear to
indicate the opposite, but these cannot be disclosed whilst the
investigation is still in progress.  One Turkish woman and two of her
children lost their lives in the attack on Easter Monday.

Concert promoter Avram arrested on suspicion of tax fraud
</H1>
Marcel Avram, one of the world's leading concert promoters, was arrested
in Munich yesterday and is now in police custody.  Mr. Avram, chairman of
Mama Concerts, is charged with tax fraud.  Prior to his arrest, his office
and private residence had been searched.  Mr. Avram and his agency Mama
Concerts are considered to be one of the largest event organizers.  Hardly
a day goes by when 59-year-old Avram cannot be seen side-by-side with any
star of the music business in the Munich popular press.  Of his present
surroundings, however, there are unlikely to be any pictures, for Mr.
Avram has been in solitary confinement in the Munich-Stadelheim jail since
last night, when the investigating judge executed the arrest warrant
issued several days previously.  The charges are tax fraud.  Although the
investigation has been underway for three years, it remains unclear,
whether Avram was the sole beneficiary of these practices, or whether his
music star clients with permanent residences abroad are also implicated.
The auditors have seized numerous boxes of documents which will be
examined during the coming months.

Members of the Suhl Orchestra go on hunger strike
</H1>
Members of the Philharmonic Orchestra of the Thuringian city of Suhl have
begun a hunger strike.  They are protesting against the imminent
dissolution of the orchestra.  The authorities in Suhl have withdrawn the
orchestra's 3.5 million DM funding.  Up until now the costs of financing
the Suhl orchestra have been divided equally between the city and the
State of Thuringia.  The city authorities justified the measure, saying
that Suhl was already deeply in debt.
