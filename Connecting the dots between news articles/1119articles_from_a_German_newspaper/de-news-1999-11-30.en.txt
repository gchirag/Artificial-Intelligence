Kohl admits hidden accounts on special party meeting
</H1>
The CDU executive board has started its special meeting at
which former Chancellor Helmut Kohl is to answer questions about
alleged hidden accounts. Before the meeting, Mr. Kohl said he did not
feel stressed by the party donations affaire. A Berlin newspaper
reported that the CDU honorary president had worked with the unofficial
accounts until the end of his office. In addition, Kohl had not
collected any donations for the CDU. Party friends thought it unlikely
that the CDU president with his large network would have been unable to
raise any funds. Meanwhile, the parliamentary executive officer of the
CDU Hans-Peter Repnik announced that he would file a complaint with the
Constitutional Court against the party donation inquiry committee
because the government coalition had violated all regulations by
arbitrarily appointing members to the committee. Repnik called on
Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Gruene to let the committee represent
the actual political proportions of the parliament. Earlier this
afternoon ex-Chancellor Kohl had admitted for the first time that there
were hidden accounts during his office. He also stressed that political
decisions have never been influenced by money and that he had not been
mutable. CDU secretary-general Wolfgang Schaeuble backed Kohl saying
that nobody had profited [personally]. According to a report by the
daily Leipziger Volkszeitung the CDU presidency assumes that at least
two to three million marks have bypassed the official bookkeeping.

Real estate speculator Schneider again suspected for tax fraud
</H1>
Real estate speculator Juergen Schneider purportedly still has
assets worth millions of marks in off-shore accounts on the Channel
Islands Jersey and Guernsey. News magazine Der Stern reported that the
accounts have been held in trust by Schneider's sister. The money was
part of the inheritance from Schneider's father, but his three children
had not paid taxes on the money. Now, they will be sued for tax fraud.
Thus it is unclear whether Schneider will be released from prison where
he is serving a 7-year sentence for aggravated fraud. His status as
day-parole prisoner and the permission for a holiday have been
recalled. According to the ARD broadcasting chain Schneider has
inherited 13 million marks for which he has not paid taxes. Schneider
claims that he has not accepted the inheritance. Now, the Prosecution
must examine the allegations.
