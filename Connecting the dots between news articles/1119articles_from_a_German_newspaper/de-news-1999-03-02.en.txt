Decision on strike ballots in banking sector
</H1>
A strike is looming in the banking sector. The unions HBV and DAG announced
that strikes would start as soon as mid-month after the ballots next week.
Last night, the third round of bargaining talks for the banking employees
had been adjourned without result or setting a new date. Today, the
bargaining commissions of HBV and DAG declared the talks failed. According
to the employers an agreement could have been reached if the unions had
accepted a realistic wage improvement. The employers had offered for the
first half of 1999 a one-time payment of 850 DM. HBV and DAG, however,
demanded pay increases of 6, respectively 6.5%.

Schroeder: no co-operation with PDS on federal level
</H1>
The argument among Social-Democrats continues about a possible
collaboration with the Socialist party PDS. The State Premiers of
Lower-Saxony and Rhineland-Palatinate, Gerhard Glogowski and Kurt Beck,
rejected any co-operation with the successor of the SED, thus opposing
party leader Oscar Lafontaine. They said that one could not collaborate
with a party that had not become clear yet with its totalitarian past. SPD
deputy president Wolfgang Thierse made similar statements.
After a meeting of the SPD Bundestag faction, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
took a stand on the debate. He said a collaboration with the PDS on the
federal level was out of the question for him because of differences in
principle. Schroeder said: "I will not be involved in any collaboration
with the PDS in the Bundestag." Differences between the SPD and PDS in both
interior politics and economics must not be covered. Further Schroeder
stressed the SPD's position that the lower party hierarchies in East
Germany would have to decide for themselves about a collaboration with the
PDS.
On the weekend, Lafontaine had endorsed statements by SPD secretary-general
Mr. Schreiner that the Social-Democrats had to rethink the "Dresden
Declaration" of 1994 that excludes a collaboration between SPD and PDS.

DIHT spring survey shows pessimistic view
</H1>
Industry and trade are pessimistic about the future. The Council of German
Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) expects only 1.5% economic growth this year.
Managing director Mr. Schoser said the change of mood in the enterprises
was due to the latest collective bargaining results and the "unclear course
of the federal government". At the presentation of the traditional spring
survey by chambers of commerce Mr. Schoser said in Bonn that the
expectations had declined compared to the fall survey especially in the
industry. The export impulses remained weak. In addition the tendency for
investments decreased and the consumption demand, too, did not take up any
speed. Schoser called the latest collective bargaining results a "heavy
burden".

Parents to pay tution for primary school
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg's Finance Minister, Mr Stratthaus, proposed
that parents payed tution to finance reliable teaching and care hours
at primary schools. These tutions should depend on income, in the opinion
of the minister. The state's budget could not be further burdened by the
introduction of half-day care [at primary schools].

<P>
The union "Erziehung und Wissenschaft" (Education and Science) refused
the proposal of the minister. When the minister believes that reliable
half-day care was necessary it had to be introduced overall as a regular
service that is without any tution or fees, said the union's regional
head, Mr Dahlem, to SWR radio station.

Stronger stance against repeated under-age offenders
</H1>
The State of Baden-Wuerttemberg will take a stronger stance
against children and youth that repeatedly get into conflict with the law,
announced the state's Interior Minister Thomas Schaeuble in Stuttgart.
According to the minister, the state criminal police has searched police
statistics for offenders aged 10 to 17 years. They found 26 children and
355 youth that have been registered for more than 20 criminal offences.
In the future, police, the judiciary system, the youth welfare departments
and the foreigners' offices in the cities and communities will install
coordinating bodies to exchange study and to decide on individual cases -
that could even lead to the expulsion of delinquents.
[This is obviously aimed at foreigners only... - the translator.]
