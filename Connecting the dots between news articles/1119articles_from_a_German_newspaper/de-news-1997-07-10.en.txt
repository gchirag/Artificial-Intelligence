Consensus on tax reform within reach
</H1>
 The mediation committee set up to sort out differences between
Bundestag and Bundesrat in the tax reform is approaching a consensus.  Chief
negotiator for the SPD, Hamburg's Mayor Mr. Voscherau said an agreement on the
issues of corporate capital gains tax and employment overhead cost is
thinkable.  He welcomed that the tone of the discussion has become more
pragmatic.  Two working groups were formed that are supposed to prepare the
second session of the mediation committee at the end of July.  Minister
President Vogel of Thuringia said that he is now less pessimistic than before
the meeting.  The SPD's demands in the tax reform are an increase of the gas
tax by six Pfennigs and of the V.A.T. by one percent.  In addition, the SPD
wants to reduce pension and unemployment contributions by one percent.

Coalition approves drafts for '97 budget supplement and '98 budget
</H1>
 The parliamentary groups of CDU/CSU and FDP have approved Finance
Minister Waigel's bills for a 1997 budget supplement for and for the 1998
budget.  Head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Mr. Schaeuble, said in Bonn
it had been important to get both drafts under way.  The supplementary budget
for this year has arisen under difficult constitutional circumstances.  New
borrowings would exceed investments which Mr. Waigel says is acceptable given
the special conditions.  However, this is only lawful if the Bundestag finds
that the economic balance is disturbed.  The SPD doesn't grant this fact.  In
general, the SPD criticized Waigel's plans as completely unsound.  The
Minister sells federal property to plug holes in the budget.  True
consolidation is not happening, the SPD concluded.

Sick pay to be cut for Public Services
</H1>
 The Federal Government, the States and municipalities are planning to
cut sick pay for their roughly four million employees in the public sector.
Federal Minister of the Interior, Mr. Kanther, called on the unions to start
collective bargaining talks early.  He proposed September 25 as starting date
which was rejected by OeTV [Union for public service] and DAG [National union
of employees].  Regular negotiations are scheduled for January.  The unions
declared that cuts in sick pay are out of the question.  Mr. Kanther asked the
unions to appreciate that the public service guarantees secure employments.

<P>
In fall 1996, the governing coalition changed sick pay regulations.  However,
the extension of these modifications to public service officials was struck
down in the Bundesrat by the SPD-led states.  In breaking with the past,
Mr. Kanther's current offensive is supported by the SPD State Finance
Ministers as well as municipal employers.

Lower-Saxon State budget for 1995 maybe partly unconstitutional
</H1>
 The State budget of Lower-Saxony for 1995 may have been partly
unconstitutional.  This was decided by the State's High Court today.  The
State Government had failed to give adequate reasons for exceeding the
borrowing limits as set by the State Constitution.  Minister President
Schroeder doesn't see a need for action after this finding.  The controversial
budget bill has been executed.  The SPD State Government made improvements
already in the 1996 budget in a critical point.  The chairman of the
Lower-Saxon CDU, Mr. Wulf, called the court's finding a defeat for
Mr. Schroeder.  The decision is a victory for tax payers, municipalities and
the CDU in Lower-Saxony.

DIHT: Economic growth in 1997 from exports
</H1>
 The economic growth this year is again a result of exports.  The
Council of German Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) expects an increase in exports
by six to seven percent.  This would noticeably exceed last year's export
growth which lay at 4.6 percent.  In the opinion of DIHT Secretary General
Mr. Schoser (sp?) this indicates that corporations have done their homework
and increased their competitiveness.  He does not count on the export trend's
jump-starting the domestic economy.  Mr. Schoser said that making Germany a
more attractive economic location continues to be a political challenge.

after a meeting of the Central Bank Council at Aschau on lake Chiemsee.  The
Council left the interest rates unchanged.

Flooding now threatens eastern Germany
</H1>
 The flood that has inundated large parts of Poland and the
Czech Republic now also threatens eastern Germany.  According to the State
Environmental Agency at Dresden the high water mark on the Elbe and Neisse
rivers has risen considerably and the level of the Oder river is increasing as
well.  The experts of the Catastrophe Protection Agency expect water levels to
recede over the next days.  In eastern Europe at least 39 people have died as
a consequence of the flooding.  Numerous persons are still missing.  The Czech
Government has assured the victims of the flood of immediate financial aid.
In southern Poland and in northern parts of the Czech Republic large areas are
still under water.  Meanwhile, however, the heavy rainfalls have lessened.
International organizations have started coordinating aid for the affected
regions.

State Health Agency in Lower-Saxony cautions against poisonous algae
</H1>
 The Lower-Saxon Health Agency has cautioned against poisonous algae
in lakes.  They could be a health hazard especially for children.  Under no
circumstances should the blue-green threads, that increasingly float on the
surface of swimming lakes, be ingested.  They could provoke irritation of
mucous membranes, nausea, diarrhea as well as fever and vomiting, the Health
Agency informed.  The bloom of these algae is caused by the high levels of
phosphate pollutants in the lakes.
