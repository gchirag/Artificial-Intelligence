Day Before State Parliament Elections in Hesse
</H1>
A new state parliament will be elected tomorrow in Hesse.  Approximately
4.3 million registered voters will have 17 parties and electoral
coalitions to choose from. The CDU and FDP have made it their goal to
break up the SPD and Green majority that has ruled for the past 8 years.
However, according to opinion polls, the government, led by Minister
President Eichel (SPD), will probably strengthen its lead over the
opposition and its challenger Koch (CDU).

purchase low-interest government bonds. There was no official statement
from the Ministry of Finance on this matter.

levels stable for another year if more hospitals are closed. Ahrens
claimed that up to 20 percent of patients could be treated on an
outpatient basis. Ahrens referred to a recent European study that claims
that there are 85,000 unnecessary hospital beds in Germany as a whole and
that patients are also often kept in hospitals longer than necessary in
order earn more money. Ahrens claims that this nonsense must stop.

DAG Also Approves of Pension at the Age of 60
</H1>
The German white-collar union (DAG) is calling for a deduction-free
pension as of 60 years of age. The labor market can quickly be relieved of
the strain of one and a half million unemployed persons through early
retirement. At the same time the federal government must increase the
contributions to the pension scheme. The DAG thereby supports the German
Federation of Labor Unions which will make these recommendations in talks
meant to draw up the Alliance for Work.

Will There be Another Design Competition for the Holocaust Memorial?
</H1>
The American architect Eisenmann strictly refuses any further reduction of
his field of steles for the Berlin Holocaust memorial. His original design
had planned 4,000 concrete pillars; the second reworked design had 2,700.
The Berlin State minister of culture is now assuming that there will have
to be another design competition for the memorial. Eisenmann told the
newspaper "Berliner Tagesspiegel" that he would take part. ["Stele" is a
relatively rare architectural term for a memorial slab found near tombs.
Eisenmann uses it to describe the rectangular pillars of various heights
that make up his proposed memorial.]

Chaos on the Roads in Bavaria and Austria
</H1>
Massive snowfalls have created considerable chaos and delays on the roads
of Bavaria and Austria and led to kilometer-long traffic jams heading
north as well as south. The Tauern autobahn in Austria was closed near

tomorrow morning at the earliest. According to the Austrian automobile
club, all of the alternative routes are also overloaded. The Inntal
autobahn is also chaotic. Other streets, for example the approach to
Arlberg, were closed due to the danger of avalanches.
