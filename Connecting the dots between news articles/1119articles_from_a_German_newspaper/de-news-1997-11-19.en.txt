FDP has to pay back DM 12.4 million
</H1>
Following a ruling by the Administrative Court in Cologne, the
FDP must pay back DM 12.4 million it had received from the federal Party
Financing Fund. The court based its decision on an error in the 1996
application for the funds. The complainants in the case against the FDP
were the right-wing Republikaner party, the "Grey Panthers" seniors'
party, and the South-Schleswig Voters' Association. They charged that the
Bundestag administration had granted the FDP the funds even though the
party had missed the application deadline. The Republikaner party was
refused funding for exactly the same reason.
<P>
Despite the ruling, the Bundestag administration remains convinced that it
acted correctly. The FDP is appealing the case to the Superior
Administrative Court in Muenster.

Political parties in Germany get their funding primarily from three

Governmental purse-strings to remain tight
</H1>
Federal, state, and local levels of government intend to remain frugal in
the coming year, keeping expenses from increasing by more than 2 percent
over current levels. Finance ministers and representatives of local
governments made a statement to that effect in a Financial Planning
Council led by Federal Finance Minster Waigel in Bonn.
Among the plans: interest payments on state-issued credit in the private
sector are to increase to DM 140 billion, whereas the figure for this year
is DM 134 billion. Despite significantly less tax revenue than expected,
the total deficit for all levels of government in 1998 is supposed to be
DM 101 billion, down from this year's DM 110 billion. Surpluses are to go
into special federal funding programs, ranging from the EU to coal mining
subsidies.

Budget conflict between federal government and Federal Labour Office
</H1>
The federal government and the Federal Labour Office are in conflict over
the latter's budget for 1998. The Office, by a narrow majority, approved a
budget which anticipated DM 16.5 billion in federal money. The government,
in its budget, allotted the Office only DM 14.1 billion. The Office's
vice-chairman, Engelen-Kaefer, said that given the high unemployment rate,
the amount was too small. The Office's budget assumes a projected 4.38
million unemployed in the coming year; the projected budget total for the
organization comes to DM 110.92 billion.

Protestants want Day of Prayer and Repentance a legal holiday again
</H1>
Protestants in Germany, speaking in church services and assemblies, are
calling for the Day of Prayer and Repentance to be made a legal holiday
again. The chairman of the German Protestant Church Council, Kock (?),
said that given the growing number of supporters, this is a grass-roots
movement. The leader of the Church Synod, Schmude (sp?), wanted employers'
contributions to nursing-care insurance to be compensated for in some
other way; he suggest shortening vacation time by one day.
The Day of Prayer and Repentance has been abolished as a legal holiday
everywhere in Germany except in the state of Saxony.

million for the next two years.

German soldiers given warning by court
</H1>
The courts have issued a warning to six soldiers in the German
Armed Forces. During an exercise, the six soldiers had abused four members
of the reserves, taking them prisoner, forcing them to stand out in the
cold for three hours, and to kneel on tentpoles, and spraying them with
water at an air temperature of 4 degrees Celsius. The judges were lenient
with the soldiers because they confessed and regretted their actions, also
because their commander had not instructed them properly.
