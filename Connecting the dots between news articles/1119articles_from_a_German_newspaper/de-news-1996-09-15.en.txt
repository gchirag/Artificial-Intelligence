Bonn's Comments on Elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina
</H1>
 Federal Minister for Foreign affairs Kinkel has called the
elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina less than perfect but indispensable.
The election was an important step in realizing the Dayton peace
agreements, Mr. Kinkel stated in Bonn.  It had been clear from the
beginning, he stated, that these elections would not be up to the
usual standard of functioning democracies.  He added, however, that
he counted on the conclusion of the democratic reconstruction of the
country by the end of this year.
On the other hand, Mr. Verheugen, an SPD politician, expressed
scepticism in regard to the elections. During a radio interview, he
said that they would not contribute to the true pacification of the
country.  He stated that the SPD should agree to the continued
presence of German troops on the basis of a UN mandate.
A spokesperson for Federal Minister of Defense Ruehe, CDU, declared
readiness to send infantry units of the German army to Bosnia to
police the peace.

Stolpe: Tax Debate Is Pretext for Raising Value-Added-Tax
</H1>
The minister president of Brandenburg, Mr. Stolpe, SPD
considers it a possibility that the on-going  debate about a major
tax reform serves as a pretext for raising the value-added-tax as
early as at the end of this year.  Mr. Stolpe said on South German
Radio he suspected that the Bonn government would raise the valueadded-tax to close the gaps in the 1997 federal budget.  The state
needed the money, he continued, after the solidarity surtax had been
prematurely dropped.  Mr. Stolpe referred to the raising of the
value-added-tax as a declaration of bankruptcy of financial policies
because it would have an especially harsh effect on people with low
incomes.

Ruettgers Wants to Reform Apprentice Training
</H1>
 Federal Minister for Education Ruettgers wants to reform the
training of apprentices.  In a newspaper interview, Mr. Ruettgers
appealed to the states to organize continuing schooling in such a way
that the young people would be in their apprenticeship training 20 to
30 additional days  in the course of a year.  In many cases, the
second day of continued schooling each week could be dispensed with.
Also, Mr.  Ruettgers believes, the amount of the training subsidy
[granted to employers] should be reconsidered.  Through such a
reform, the Minister hopes to create readiness for the creation of
new apprenticeships.  In the meantime, the unions have expressed
their opposition.  They fear that, instead of learning a trade,
apprentices are increasingly abused as cheap labor.

40%; the Greens and the FDP, approximately 6% each.

Baden-Wuerttemberg's Savings Package Encounters Criticism
</H1>
The savings package of Baden-Wuerttemberg's CDU-FDP-
government has encountered criticism among parents' representatives.
The workshop of the united parents' advisory board
[Gesamtelternbeiraete] referred to the projected extra payments
on pupil transportation to and from school as a special tax for
parents.  It would disadvantage parents in socially weak families.
The transportation of pupils who attend a technical school or
academic high school costs between 500 and 1 000 Marks per school
year per child.  Those who could not afford these expenses, would
have to send their children to a general school [Hauptschule].  They
called it incomprehensible that state parliament deputies avail
themselves of free public transportation while parents are asked to
pay for their children's travel to and from school.

30% of Breast Cancer Related Deaths Avoidable
</H1>
 According to the views of scientists, approximately 30%
of breast cancer related deaths could be prevented by early
diagnosis.  At the 16th annual meeting of the German Society for
Breast Medicine in Goettingen, the physicians emphasized that a tumor
diagnosed early with the aid of mammography could be removed and the
breast could be saved.  The feared radiation entailed in mammography,
the scientists continued, has been reduced by means of new techniques
and now corresponds to the amount of radiation received on a
transatlantic flight.
