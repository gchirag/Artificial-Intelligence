Thierse New President of the Bundestag
</H1>
Wolfgang Thierse (SPD) is the first Eastern-German politician as
president of the German Bundestag (lower house of parliament). He was
elected with 512 votes of 666 parliamentarians being present.
Afterwards the deputies were elected. The Union had tried to prevent
the election of the PDS-politician Petra Bless as vice president of
the Bundestag with a request. But with the new majority situation this
did not happen, because most parliamentarians of the SPD, the Greens
and the PDS decided against this. Also the FDP did not support the
request of its former coalition partner CDU/CSU. Thus each faction
only had the chance to bring through one candidate. After the
nomination of Rudolf Seiters, the CSU-candidate Geiger had no chance
anymore. Finally, the PDS-candidate Bless won the close voting against
Geiger. Bless got 355 votes, Geiger 285 and 19 MPs refrained from
voting. Before that, the SPD-politician Fuchs, the CDU-politician
Seiters, the candidate of Buendnis90/The Greens, Vollmer, and the
nominee of the FDP, Solms, had been elected as vice presidents.
