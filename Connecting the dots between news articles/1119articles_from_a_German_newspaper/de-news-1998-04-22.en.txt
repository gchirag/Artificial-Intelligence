Federal government presents plan for employment policy
</H1>
The federal government has put a resolution of the EU-summit in
Luxembourg into action and submitted a plan of action for employment
policy.  The core of the program as presented is strengthened
assistance for unemployed young persons, as well as the long-term
unemployed.  The necessary funds are to come primarily from the
reorganization of existing budget appropriations.  Minister of
Economics Rexrodt stressed that labor policy is primarily a national
affair.  The Greens accused the government of activism; the unions
criticized the program as being largely without substance or
perspective.

Printing industry headed for labor dispute
</H1>
The German printing industry is on course for a labor dispute.  IG
Medien, the industry union, today explained that collective bargaining
for the approximately 200,000 employees has failed.  The no-conflict
period between the industry and the union expires at the end of April.
 A union spokes-person in Stuttgart said the employers do not seem
prepared to substantially improve their offer of a 1.5% increase in
salaries and wages.  The employers' association said that the decision
by IG Medien made no sense.  The employers offer was a reasonable and
solid base for negotiation, said a spokesperson for the employers'
association, and referred to settlements in the civil service and
construction industry.  The negotiations will  continue on May 13th,
in Frankfurt/Main.

Waigel criticizes lack of unity on stability pact
</H1>
Minister of Finance Waigel criticized the German states for their
continuing failure to agree on the national stability pact for which
he had asked. At a meeting of the CDU economic council in Bonn, Waigel
said if the states did not reach an agreement at their conference
tomorrow, he would introduce his own version of the bill.  The pact
would specify fixed debt ceilings for the country, the states and
municipalities.  In addition it will contain penalty provisions to
apply if the allowable deficit criteria are exceeded.  The chairperson
of the council, Murmann (sp?), also called for a reorganization of the
federal transfer payments.

FDP defends call for repeal of solidarity tax
</H1>
The FDP defended the resolution of its party congress to repeal the
solidarity tax.  During a question period in the Bundestag, FDP
General Secretary Westerwelle as well as politicians of the CDU/CSU
stressed that abolishing the surcharge implies no reduction in
solidarity with the former East German states.  Representatives of the
opposition, from the SDP and Green parties, strengthened their
criticism of Liberals, saying that they intended to deprive the East
German states of support.  They also claimed that this move
demonstrates how little interest leading politicians of the Bonn
coalition seem to have for the problems of East Germany.

Soccer championship ticket sales cause chaos
</H1>
The French organizers of the World Soccer Championship only sold
15,000 tickets today, despite more than 20 million telephone
inquiries.  The remaining 90,000 tickets will be sold over the next
several days, according to a spokesperson.  The onslaught of soccer
fans paralyzed European telephone networks.  In Brussels meanwhile, 30
delegates of the European parliament said they had submitted
complaints to Paris about what was in their view an unfair
distribution of tickets for the soccer games, saying that it is
against European law for only 1/4 of the 2.5 million tickets to be
sold outside of France.
