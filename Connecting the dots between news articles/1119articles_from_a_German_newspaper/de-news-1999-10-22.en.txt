'Tanks to Turkey' issue on coalition talks' agenda
</H1>
Coalition partner The Greens want the rules for weapons exports tightened,
in the wake of internal squabbling about the delivery of a tank for
evaluation to  Turkey. The Greens' spokesperson for defence matters Beer
told a Berlin newspaper, that it wasn't good enough to change a few words in
the rules, to be nice to the Greens. She emphasised that weapons should only
be sold, even to NATO member-countries, if the latter respected human rights.
Federal manager of the Greens Buettighofer previously had declared that his
party would try and mobilise the general public in this matter. He
emphasised in Berlin, that they would wait 'till after Monday's coalition
talks before getting into anything concrete.

Opposition parties to shoot down health reforms in Upper House (Bundesrat)
</H1>
In spite of the prospect of sweeteners in the form of transfer payments to
East German public health insurers, the opposition parties intend to shoot
down government's health reforms in the Upper House (Bundesrat). Head of
the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Schaeuble refuted reports claiming that some
states would break ranks and back the project instead. Federal Health
Minister Fischer had offered to pay several billions of marks to the East
German public health insurers, who are in debt, but tied it to her
reform-plans. The reform project is to be passed by parliament at the
beginning of the month, but its main components require the Upper
House's (Bundesrat) consent.

Mr Fischer: German-French relations important
</H1>
Foreign Minister Fischer once again said that German-French relations were
fundamental for the development of Europe. At the opening of the first
German-French forum in Paris he, as well as his French colleague Vedrin,
refuted claims that relations between the two countries had cooled
substantially. Of course there would be the odd discrepancy, but that's what
created dynamics, according to Mr Fischer. Politicians, journalists and
experts will discuss about the media and communications policies until
tomorrow, when the forum closes its doors.

Health reform debate hotting up
</H1>
The debate about health reforms has been cranked up a notch. The Medical
Association (Aerzteverband Hartmannbund) opened their Annual General Meeting
at Baden-Baden with vigorous attacks on Federal Health Minister Fischer.
President Thomas said government's plans to reform the health sector showed
"signs of ideological stubbornness and a tragic absence of factual
knowledge". Head of the CDU Schaeuble stated that his party would block the
reforms in the Upper House (Bundesrat).

forgot that this scheme would allow them to have long-term awards
