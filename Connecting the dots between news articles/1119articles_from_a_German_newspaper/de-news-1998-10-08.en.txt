Greens will lower social contributions
</H1>
Greens Party Spokesperson Juergen Trittin announced today a reduction of
pension and unemployment insurance of up to 4%. The incurred costs of DM
70 billion will be financed through an eco tax imposed on power
consumption. Mr Trittin did not say how expensive gasoline will become.

<P>
The Social Democrats and the Greens agree on higher energy taxes and
lower non-wage labour costs. Mr Scharping said that they want to have
ecological elements in the tax system which offer incentives to conserve
resources, especially power. Scharping does not want to be a part of the
gasoline debate. Trittin, on the other hand, explained that concerning
gas prices, Germany ranks 13th within the European Union. Several
countries have reached a price of DM 2.00 per litre, so there is a lot
of room for negotiation.

<P>
CDU's Parliamentary Leader Schaeuble protested against the accusation
that the old parliament had hampered with balance sheets. "It is a lie
that the Social Democrats now know something they didn't know before.
All numbers we put on the table in early September were accurate."

small print only. The Supreme Court indicated that it is common knowledge
that the phones are paid for with net access fees which apply to every
purchase. The Supreme Court asked the dealership to start itemizing the
various costs to fully inform the buyer.

The first trial against the 14-year-old serial perpetrator Mehmet started
