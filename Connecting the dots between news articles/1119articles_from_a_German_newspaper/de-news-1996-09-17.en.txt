Sick-leave payments also to be reduced for public service employees
</H1>
The tabloid BILD reported today that the federal government plans to reduce
sick-leave payments also for public service workers. According to the
newspaper's information the collective agreements will be terminated this
autumn if the Bundesrat, the Upper House of Parliament, approves the
cutting of sick-leave payments for government employees. This means that
the new regulations of the government's austerity package would apply to
the whole public service. Employees would receive only 80% of their normal
wage for the first six weeks of sick-leave.

Hesse's chemical industry wants to cut sick-leave payments
</H1>
Starting October 1, the employers of Hesse's chemical industry want to
reduce sick-leave payments to 80%. Mr. Gruber, member of the board of
directors of the Federation of Chemical Industries, said sick-leave
payments were not covered by the sector's general collective agreement.
Therefore, the general regulations as set forth in the new law are
applicable, i.e., payments are reduced to 80% of the normal wage during the
first six weeks of sick-leave. His view was shared by the Employers
Association of the Metal Industries (Gesamtmetall). Mr. Stumpe, president
of Gesamtmetall, said the general collective agreement gave the workers no
individual legal right. In addition, Gesamtmetall recommended its member
organisations to terminate existing collective agreements regarding
Christmas and holiday benefits by December 31.

Discussion about repatriation of Bosnian refugees
</H1>
Two days before the decisive conference of state interior ministers,
Alliance90/Greens have rejected a repatriation of Bosnian refugees starting
October 1. Mr. Mueller, the party's spokesman of the Bundestag faction,
stated that conditions in their home country prevented an integration. Mr.
Cohn-Bendit, Member of the European Parliament, suggested to leave the
decision to European bodies. An expulsion would make the German interior
ministers to accomplices of war criminals.
The State of Brandenburg will not repatriate Bosnian refugees before March
next year. A spokesperson of the Interior Ministry said in Potsdam, the
foreigner offices had received instructions to that end already in April.
Mr. Ziel, Interior Minister of Brandenburg, will continue to work for a
joint solution for all states.
The president of the Parliamentary Committee of the Interior, Mr. Penner
(SPD), however, wants to stick to the October 1 date. In a radio interview
he advocated a gradual procedure.
The United Nations has called upon Germany and other countries not to
repatriate refugees from Bosnia-Herzegovina for the time being. A
spokeswoman of the UN Children's Fund Unicef said the elections in Bosnia
had showed that a return to the original areas was still difficult. An
expulsion of refugees had to depend from the further development in Bosnia.
More than 300,000 refugees from Bosnia are living in Germany.

Verheugen for extension of IFOR-engangement with German participation
</H1>
Vice-president of the SPD Bundestag faction Guenther Verheugen advocates
for an extension of the IFOR engagement in Bosnia involving German units.
In a radio interview he said that only the presence of a strong IFOR
contingent creates the conditions for the rebuilding of communities. The
strength of the troops, however, could be reduced significantly. Germany's
armed forces, police and other helpers had stood the test in the
deployments until now. Drawing from past experience, Verheugen did not
expect the soldiers to become involved in fights.

Telekom on the road to the stock market
</H1>
Speculators have waited anxiously for the half-year balance of German
Telekom. These figures are important criteria for buying shares when
Telekom is listed at the stock market in November. Future shareholders can
be content with winnings of DM2.7 billion during the first six months. On
the other side, there are debts worth DM105 billion. "Fit for the Stock
Market" is the slogan of the half-year balance. Telekom's top manager Ron
Sommer said, Telekom -Europe's largest telecommunications company according
to the balance report- was able to increase its returns by 1.5% during the
first six months in spite of price reductions of 15%. By now, telephone
prices in Germany were ten percent lower than the average of the most
important industrialized nations. One fifth of the shares will be available
to shareholders after the company's listing at the stock market, the
remainder will be owned by the government. So far, Telekom is wholly
state-owned. Sommer promised future shareholders attractive dividends. The
greatest latest success of Telekom was the expansion of ISDN and on-line
services. Subscriber numbers increased rapidly. Sommer was also content
with the legal frame provided by government politics. He rejected, however,
demands by competitors to open access to its proprietary networks even
further. The limit of what is acceptable had been reached, Telekom must not
degrade to a quarry for competitors, Sommer said.

Fourth day in Graf trial

In the trial against Mr. Graf and Mr. Eckardt the Court defended its
decision to suspend the arrest warrants against the two accused. At the
same time, presiding judge Justice Plass rejected a reproach by Prosecutor
Jobski that Court and Defence have made secret arrangements. Plass stated
that Graf and Eckardt would not have to expect long prison sentences beyond
their detention during investigation. Therefore it was unlikely that they
would flee to another country. Moreover, Graf had agreed to a number of
injunctions. Before the two accused can be released, the Higher Regional
Court in Karlsruhe has to decide about a complaint by the Prosecution.
