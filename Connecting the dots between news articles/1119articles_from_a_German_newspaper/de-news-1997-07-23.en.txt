Dikes break in Brandenburg
</H1>
Frankfurt an der Oder. For the first time since the recent flooding
began, the river Oder has breached a dike to the south of Frankfurt,
causing hundreds of people to flee their homes. Near the village of
Aurith, which has already been evacuated, the high water level broke a
150 metre wide hole in the dike; despite trying for several hours,
helpers could not fill the hole. Shortly after 3 p.m., the crisis
management group in Potsdam decided to abandon Brieksow-Finenheerd in
an effort to conserve manpower and materials. Ziel, Brandenburg's
Minister of the Interior, decided at the scene that efforts would
continue to shore up the ends of the dike at least, so that the damage
would not affect any more than 80 metres. Around half a million litres
of water escaped through the breach in the dike every second; this
provided a little relief for the areas along the river to the north -
in Frankfurt, for example, the record water levels dropped back under
6.30 metres. Hundreds of thousands of sand-bags are being brought to
the region from other federal states, along with other support from
specialists and donations.

No more work permits to be issued to Eastern Europeans
</H1>
Germany will no longer accept workers from Poland, Hungary,
and other south-eastern European countries. The Federal Labour Office
has instructed all employment offices that they may not issue any new
work permits to people from Poland and Hungary. This ordinance is the
result of an initiative by the EU Commission which decided that the
quota agreements between Germany and eastern Europe countries on this
issue contravened EU law.

Germany against new BSE measures
</H1>
Despite Germany's resisting the move, the EU Ministers of
Agriculture have agreed by a small majority to implement new measures
in the fight against BSE. Because of the risk of mad cow disease
(BSE), the use of the parts of cattle, sheep and goats which are most
likely to carry the infection will be forbidden in the EU from next
year onwards. The ban applies to the production of foods, animal feed,
cosmetics and pharmaceuticals. The parts of animals affected by the
ban are the brain, eyes and spinal cord; the BSE agent is thought to
affect these parts the greatest. BSE is thought to cause the deadly
Creutzfeld-Jakobson disease in humans. Up till now, only animals from
the UK were affected by the ban.

Greens call for tougher approach to financial crime
</H1>
The Greens have said that shoplifters and drug addicts should
not be treated harshly by the justice system. They have announced an
alternative concept for public safety and called for a tougher
approach to financial crime. They say that crime is best combated by
tackling its causes, such as high unemployment, the lack of training
places and the poor integration of foreigners living in Germany. The
Greens also attacked Gerhard Schroeder, saying that he was only trying
to play on people's fears with his suggestions for fighting crime and
that his ideas were a bad copy of those of the CDU/CSU. The Greens
also say that crime committed by foreigners should be considered more
carefully, as simple statistics often give a completely inaccurate
picture of reality.

Baden-Wuerttemberg to support German construction firms
</H1>
Prime Minister Teufel has announced that the federal state
Baden-Wuerttemberg has decided to only award contracts for the
construction of new buildings and roads to firms which employ at least
70 per cent of their workforce full-time. This will largely exclude
the use of sub-contractors who employ people from other countries on
low wages from state work. This policy is intended to help the middle
sized businesses which are bound by the pay and condition agreements
that are agreed with the unions and, the state government believe,
should be protected, along with their employees.

Jan Ullrich retains the yellow jersey in Tour de France
</H1>
Jan Ullrich continues to dominate the Tour de France. The 23
year old professional cyclist has defended his yellow jersey for the
seventh time now, in the fifth to last stage of the most gruelling
cycle tour in the world. He arrived at the finish today together with
the other leading riders. The winner of today's stage was Neil
Stephens, but he is too far behind Ullrich in the overall table to put
him in any danger; neither could Richard Virenque cut much off the
lead held by this 23 year old new cycling star from Merdingen - he is
still seven minutes behind Ullrich. The race had few surprises and the
Deutsche Telekom team never seemed likely to lose the yellow jersey,
which clearly pleased the many German fans who had come to spectate at
the biggest street party in the world.
