First Bundeswehr units to advance into Kosove on Saturday
</H1>
The UN Security Council passed the long disputed Kosovo resolution. China
was the only member who abstained. The paper is a pre-requisite for the
actions of peace keeping force in Kosovo which is supposed to consist of
50,000 soldiers. The federal government and the Bundestag in Bonn postponed
the final decision regarding an increase of the German NATO-contigent for
the Kosovo peace troops until tomorrow. Germany wants to participate with
up to 8,500 soldiers. Prior to any advances of the Bundeswehr soldiers,
however, the Bundestag will have to agree to it at tomorrow's special
meeting.
Together with British troops, the first Bundeswehr units are to advance
into the province of Kosovo via Macedonia on Saturday.  Also, Germans,
jointly with Dutch soldiers, are to control the southwesternmost corner of
Kosovo.

would not even be registered. In Koschnik's opinion, repatriation would
have to have been planned at the beginning of the war. In the meantime,
UNHCR plans an action for repatriating up to 500,000 displaced Kosovars.
