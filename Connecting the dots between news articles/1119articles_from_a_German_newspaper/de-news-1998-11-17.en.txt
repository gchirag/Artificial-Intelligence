</H1>
The parliamentary factions of Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Die Gruenen
(B90/G) have approved the bill for the eco tax. This clears the way for
introducing the bill in the Bundestag for its first reading on Friday. The
coalition intends to have the law in effect by January 1. The eco tax is to
garner 11.3 billion marks next year. The government wants to use the money
to reduce the contributions to the pension plan by 0.8 percentage points to
19.5 percent. The bill provides that taxes on gasoline and diesel increase
by 6 pfennigs, heating fuel by 4 pfennigs per litre. Gas prices will rise
by 0.32 pfennigs and electricity by 2 pfennigs per kilowatt-hour (kWh),
specially priced power for night storage heaters will increase by 1 pfennig
per kWh. B90/G resolved that also in future the eco tax alone is to finance
the reduction of wage fringe costs.

</H1>
The Handelsblatt newspaper reports that the group of economic experts, also
known as the Five Wise Men, predict 2.0 percent economic growth in 1999 and
2.75 percent for 1998. The reason for the decline is supposedly the
financial crisis in Asia. The experts also predict only a slight
improvement in the unemployment rate, a decrease from 11.2 to 10.8 percent
next year. The Handelsblatt reports further that the experts criticize the
government's tax plans. The net tax relief for citizens and enterprises was
too late and too low.
