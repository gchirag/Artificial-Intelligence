Agreement reached on keystones of tax reform 1999
</H1>
The weekly Bild am Sonntag reports that finance experts of CDU/CSU and FDP
have agreed on the keystones of the 1999 tax reform. The lowest income tax
rate will be 20 percent and the highest rate 40 percent. The commission
wants to set the basics of the tax reform by next Wednesday. The coalition
plans to approve the draft one week later. The tax cuts are to be financed
by the abolishment of tax benefits.

<P>
After Christian Union and Liberals had compromised on the 1997 annual tax
law the debate about the great tax reform has erupted again. Today, FDP
faction leader Dorothee Solms said newspaper reports that the tax
commission had already reached an agreement were wrong. Apparently, there
are still arguments about the increase of the sales tax and the future
income tax bracket. Therefore, it is questionable whether CDU, CSU, and FDP
can table their bill as planned before Christmas.

Verheugen in favour of red-green coalition after general elections
</H1>
Vice-president of the SPD Bundestag faction Guenter Verheugen is in favour
of a coalition with Alliance90/Greens after the next general elections.
Verheugen said on ZDF television that only a coalition with
Alliance90/Greens was realistic. If one wants to make changes in Germany
one would have to tell the voters how it can be done. Verheugen said
further he could understand that SPD head Oskar Lafontaine does not want to
discuss any coalition intents at this time to keep the party together.
Also on ZDF television, Mr. Schlauch, Alliance90/Greens member of
parliament, said his party did not need an SPD declaration for a coalition
but wanted more tangible signals.

Construction employers want to halve Christmas benefits
</H1>
Employers in the construction industry want to demand a cut of Christmas
benefits by half in the next collective bargaining round, says Mr.
Eichbauer, president of the German Construction Industry Association. This
was the least the employers want to achieve in view of the continuing
crisis. As in this year, production in the construction industry is
expected to decrease in 1997 by about 5% after inflation adjustment. This
would presumably mean the loss of another 100,000 jobs. Eichbauer announced
that his organization would return to the German Association of Employers
Federation after the minimum wage issue had been clarified.

SPD and unions on government's European Monetary Union policy
</H1>
Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul, vice-president of the Social-Democrats, has accused the
German government of stubbornness in the discussion of the reform of the
Maastricht Treaty. It was time that the government gave up its opposition
against including into the treaty the target of a high level of employment.
Otherwise, it would be Bonn against the majority of the twelve [fifteen]
member states. Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul also criticized her own party. The
discussion about the introduction of the new European currency was
small-minded.

<P>
The German Federation of Unions, DGB, has called upon the government to be
more open to compromises regarding the European Monetary Union. The
government's position was economic nonsense and counterproductive in
employment policy. Countries that are in a light recession should be
allowed a larger than 3 percent budget deficit. Here, the DGB shared the EU
Commission's view.

education. Vogel said on Deutschlandfunk radio that for tomorrow's success

Otherwise, Germany was in danger of falling behind in comparison with
Anglo-American universities. On the other hand, Vogel rejected an
increasing "Americanization" of science: universities for the rich because
of high tuition fees must not be created in Germany.
