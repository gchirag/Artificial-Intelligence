Germany boosted efforts to help the earthquake victims in Turkey. Johanniter,
Caritas and Help sent sniffer-dogs, water, tankers, blankets, food and

International raised 400,000 marks between them, and Bavaria's state
government another 150,000. Meanwhile Munich's Council for Foreigners
appealed to all companies and government departments, to be generous when
granting Turkish staff special leave for travel to their former home-country.

German Association of Tenants thinks state housing is in danger
</H1>
The German Association of Tenants (Deutscher Mieterbund) thinks that state
housing is in its last throes. They accused government of neglecting this
area and using it as the "Finance Minister's piggy-bank". Since 1994, the
budget had been trimmed by close to 3 billion marks to currently 1.2 billion
marks. Therefore the Association appealed to the Finance Minister to stop
further cost-cutting, and raise income-thresholds for government subsidies
instead. Government pays income-tested subsidies to owner-occupiers.

Medical practitioners give in
</H1>
Doctors relented in the renewed dispute between medical doctors and the
Health Ministry, offering excuses for a letter their deputy president had
written to the ministry, and emphasising that they intended to honour the
recently struck compromise. Last Tuesday doctors, (public) health insurers
and the ministry had agreed to make sure they did prescribe cheaper
alternatives instead of the original drugs. This put paid to a week-long
dispute about staying within the budget for drugs.

Ms Heike Drechsler flags away World Championship
</H1>
Days before the World Championship, Ms Heike Drechsler had complained about
problems with injuries. In the end, an injury in her left upper leg she had
suffered in a tournament in Switzerland last Sunday, made her throw the
towel. Ms Drechsler had arrived in Seville only yesterday. Practising
sprinting this morning broke the camel's back. Mr Drechsler and her coach
and de-facto husband Alain Blondelle said they were even relieved at the
decision, after all the hassles during the last days. Ms Drechsler, who
is long jump world-champion 1983, will return to Germany today.

Mr Schumacher back behind steering-wheel
</H1>
Someone else, however, apparently has had a successful comeback, and we are
talking of double Formula-1 world-champion Michael Schumacher. Mr Schumacher
is back in Italy and behind the wheel of his beloved red Ferrari. 40 days
after his accident at Silverstone/England, he did his first trial-rounds at
Mocello/Italy. And he was even a little bit faster than his team-mate Eddie
Irvine. In spite of that, management in Italy do not believe he will be able
to take part in the Spa/Belgium race at the end of August; they rather think
he will be back in style at Monza/Italy in September. The medical specialists
in Geneva, who had examined him yesterday, said that he was fit, but would
need another 3 to 4 months for a full recovery
