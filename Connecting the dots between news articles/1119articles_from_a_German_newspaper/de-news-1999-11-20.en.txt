Strategy session of the Greens
</H1>
Federal Environment Minister Juergin Trittin has urged his party to commit
to a realistic environmental agenda.  Rather than crusading against
environmentally problematic behavior, the party should emphasize how
environmentally conscientious behavior adds to the quality of life.

<P>
He continued that, despite many success stories, the big ecological
questions have yet to be solved. Carbon dioxide emissions from both homes
and cars have to be drastically reduced in order to save the ozone layer.
He said that politics has to prevail against blind market forces.  He
finished by saying the two big challenges for the Greens were changing
consumer behavior and getting re-elected.

<P>
This strategy session marks the first stage of crafting the new party
platform that the Greens will implement in the Spring of 2001. In the
concluding speech tomorrow, Foreign Minister Fischer will discuss Green
foreign policy.

Campaign donations scandal
</H1>
The CDU has dismissed the controversial accountant Mr. Weirauch.  The
audit of 1998 accounts will now be carried out by the accounting firm of
Schwaebische Treuhand. Mr. Weirauch is involved in the campaign donations
affair surrounding former CDU treasurer Leisler Kiep.  The news magazine
"Der Spiegel" has accused the CDU of covering up the origin of large
donations, even after Kiep left office.  "Der Spiegel" reported that the
CDU received donations from both the Quelle Corporation and the
pharmaceutical company Merck of 100,000 marks apiece.  But instead of
reporting these amounts, the CDU allegedly recorded many smaller
contributions in its books so that the donors could remain anonymous.
According to the law, all donations in excess of 20,000 marks must be
reported.

<P>
The CDU has refused any comment on these new accusations.  In the course
of this ongoing "Keip Affair," the SPD has now focussed its attention on
former party chief Helmut Kohl.  SPD representative Hoffman said that Kohl
would be summoned before the Kiep investigative committee after it is
constituted.  A long-time CDU member has filed charges against Kohl for
embezzlement of party assets.

<P>
According to a report by ZDF [German Public Television], the arrest
warrant against former CDU treasurer Kiep will be suspended next week.
Kiep was unlikely to flee after giving his testimony, the TV network
reported.  Nonetheless, the investigation of Kiep continues.  He is also
alleged to have evaded taxes on one million marks of commissions from an
arms deal.

Commission on store hours to report soon
</H1>
The government says the commission it set up to study store hours will
complete its report in a few days.  According to the Economics Ministry,
the cabinet is expected to discuss the commission's proposals at the
beginning of December. According to "Welt am Sonntag," the government
allegedly will hold off presenting the bill in parliament until mid-2000.
In the opinion of Federal Economics Minister Mueller, stores should be
able to stay open until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays and 4 p.m. on Saturdays,
but be closed all day on Sundays.

Phase-out of nuclear power
</H1>
The government's plans for a phase-out of nuclear power are moving forward
as several power companies have declared their willingness to consider the
de-centralized and temporary storage of nuclear waste.  A spokesman for
the Hamburg electric utility said there were already plans for temporary
storage facilities at Kruemmel and Brockdorf.

<P>
The chairman of the Association of German Industry (BDI), Mr. Henkel, told
the news magazine "Focus" that agreement is possible if the government
gives up the idea of making a phase-out mandatory.  The German nuclear
industry would sue the government for damages of 50 billion marks if it
were legally forced to give up nuclear power.  A phase-out over 25 years
would produce losses of 45 billion marks; if it were spread out over 30
years, it would cost 29 billion.  Henkel reiterated that an agreement is
possible, but said that existing nuclear power plants must be allowed to
remain online for a period deemed acceptable by the operators.

<P>
"Der Spiegel" reported further that the German nuclear power industry
could expect a lawsuit from the European Commission in Brussels for
receiving illegal subsidies for nuclear power.  The reasoning goes that
the nuclear power companies use special tax-free savings for tearing down
de-commissioned nuclear power plants.  This would allow German operators
to gain a competitive advantage in a liberalized European electric power
market.

Workers attempt to save the Holtzmann Corporation
</H1>
The employees of the Holtzmann Corporation, which is in financial
distress, have agreed to work longer hours and to forgo part of their
wages in order to save their jobs.  The workers' representatives at the
construction company have suggested a 43-hour work week and a 6 per cent
cut in wages. 30,000 jobs are at risk at Holtzmann.  The company needs
another 3 billion marks in loans.  The lender banks will discuss a rescue
plan tomorrow.

Glogowski's wedding paid for by local corporations
</H1>
The wedding of Lower Saxon Minister President Gerhard Glogowski was
partially paid for by companies from Braunschweig.  This was confirmed by
the state's executive office in Hanover.  Braunschweig breweries supplied
free beer, and music was provided by a bank.  The state's executive office
rejected a report by "Welt am Sonntag" which claims that Glogowski had had
his honeymoon to the Red Sea sponsored as well.  The report asserts the
Minister President had paid for his trip only after rumors of a gratis
vacation at the expense of tour organizer TUI had sprung up.

Tennis
</H1>
The entire executive board of the German Tennis Association (DTB) has
resigned. Only Mr. Hordroff remains in office.  Former DTB president Weber
has thus surrendered to his critics.  This turn of events makes it
questionable whether Boris Becker will remain team leader for the Davis
Cup.  Becker had made his participation contingent upon Mr. Weber's
remaining in office.

Track and field
</H1>
The President of the German Track and Field Association (DLV), Mr. Diegel,
is also considering resigning, this on account of the doping scandal
surrounding long-distance running star Dieter Baumann.  Diegel said that
the association's credibility has been badly damaged because the DLV has
always asserted a leading role in the fight against doping.  Diegel said
in an interview with "Suedwestfunk" radio that he didn't see any chance
for Baumann to have his ban reversed.  The doping levels found in Baumann
could not have originated from natural sources, the DLV president said.
