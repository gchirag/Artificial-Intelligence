SPD and coalition criticize call for 100 km/h speed limit
</H1>
The B90/The Greens demand for a 100 km/h speed limit on motorways
has been criticized by leading politicians of both coalition and
the Social Democrats. SPD Candidate for Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said that the Greens seem be avid to work towards
their own extinction. The call for speed limits is digging up
dead bodies. Schroeder says he will not support the
realization this kind of proposition.
Federal Minister of Transportation Matthias Wissman (CDU) stressed
that general speed limits would lead to traffic jams
and thus increase accident risks. FDP Secretary-General Guido
Westerwelle also came out against this advance of the Greens.

Ruehle defends speed limits but weakens demands
</H1>
Heide Ruehle, political manager of B90/The Greens talking
over radio "Deutschlandfunk" this morning, rejected comments about
her party being against progress. She particularly defended a speed
limit of 30 km/h in towns and villages. According to Ruehle, the
demand of The Greens is in accordance with the Council of German
Cities, for instance. Qualifying that, she said that the call for
speed limits did not have priority. A speed limit for motorways
and country roads was not a prerequisite of The Greens for a
red-green coalition. Like Fraction Chairman Joschka Fischer,
Ruehle declared her support for a 100 km/h speed limit. In order
to avoid future slips and solo efforts of individual Green
representatives, party and fraction leaders want to work out a
consensus prior to public pronunciations.
The topic "100 km/h on motorways" had been brought up again last
weekend by the transport expert of The Greens, Mrs. Altmann.

the Social Democrats for social basic social protection for pensioners.
In an interview to the daily "Sueddeutsche Zeitung",
she said that her party wants to prevent pensioners from having to

the amount which would otherwise have to be added by welfare offices.
