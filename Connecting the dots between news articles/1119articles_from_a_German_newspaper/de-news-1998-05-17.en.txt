Clement rejects cuts to social benefits
</H1>
The State Premier designate in North Rhine-Westphalia who is the
current Minister for Economics has rejected cuts to social benefits. This
statment was a clear rejection of the proposal by Mr. Hundt, the
president of the Employers' Association, that pensions and medical aid
insurance be reduced to a minimum basis. Mr. Clement said in an interview
that this was a reactionary proposal and that one shouldn't forget that
prosperity in a country is dependent on social balance. Mr. Clement
emphasised that a government led by the SPD would only rescind some of
the reforms legislated by the current coalition government. Changes would
mostly be in connection with pensions.

SPD plans to stop Castor transports after winning elections
</H1>
According to Mr. Clement, the Minister for Economics in North
Rhine-Westphalia, the SPD plan to stop the controversial transport of
atomic waste if they win the upcoming Bundestag elections. Mr. Clement
said that he could not imagine that after the elections atomic waste would
be transported at short intervals to the intermediatory storage facilities
at Aahaus and Gorleben. The SPD politician called for intermediatory
storarage facilities to be established at the atomic power stations
themselves. Moreover, he emphasised that SPD policy would be to reduce
dependence on atomic energy.

NRW plans radical reform of tertiary education
</H1>
The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia is planning to
introduce radical reforms in tertiary education and to legally prohibit
the
charging of tuition fees. This, according to the German Press Agency, was
taken from the draft of the new German state tertiary education laws.
According to the draft, more self-government is planned for universities
and technicons on matters which were formerly regulated by the Ministry
of Education. In this way, universities should in future be able to
determine for themselves how money should be allocated. It is planned
that
academic counselling will be extended and that students will have to
provide
some proof of the degree of academic knowledge attained by the end of
their second semester.

Sucessful outcome predicted for Railways wage negotiations
</H1>
It was announced in Mainz today during the second day of arbitration
talks
that agreement is expected to be reached in the current wage negotiations
for the 161 thousand employees of the German National Railways (Deutsche
Bahn AG). German Railways had proposed to make only a one-off payment of
DM 150 and to increase the state-subsidised savings scheme slightly due
to weak earnings in the first quarter of this year. This would have
amounted to a total wage increase of about a half of a percent. The
unions,
however, had called for a total wage increase of five percent; that
is, a three and a half percent increase and that wages in Eastern Germany
be
increased to the level of wages in the West. The Engine Drivers' Union
and the Union for Transport's demands were somewhat more temperate, in
that they called for a wage increase of only four percent. One reason for
assuming that there will be a positive outcome today, is that Friday is
the
deadline for reaching an agreement by arbitration.

<P>
The arbitrators presented their judgement in the afternoon. Salaries and
wages should be increased by one and a half percent. Wages in Eastern
Germany should be increased from 86 percent to 88 percent of wages in the
West. The Unions have said that the arbitration will provide a good basis
for the resumption of negotiations. The German Railways Board of
Directors
for Personnel said that the arbitrators' ruling was high, but could be
justified.
