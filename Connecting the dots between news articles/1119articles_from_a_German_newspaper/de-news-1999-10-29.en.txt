EU experts: no risk from British beef
</H1>
Health experts of the European Union consider the consumption of British
beef risk free. After two days of deliberations in Brussels the ministers
stated it was as safe as beef from any other EU countries. There was no
scientific base for the French import ban. Paris was concerned about the
threat of BSE or 'mad cow disease'. EU Health Commissioner Burn called on
France and Germany to lift immediately national restrictions for British
beef products. The government in London welcomed the decision of the EU
experts. German Health Minister Andrea Fischer said that the next steps
would be discussed with the federal states next week. Germany would rather
err on the side of the consumer, she stated in Berlin. The French
government will comment on the report in November. The EU had lifted the
ban of British beef exports as of August 1. The ban had been introduced in
1996.

Controversial Bundestag debate about demonstration tank delivery
</H1>
The decision by the Federal Security Council about the delivery of a
demonstration tank to Turkey has stirred a lively debate in the Bundestag.
Buendnis90/Gruene and PDS said the decision was wrong in view of the human
rights situation in Turkey. SPD members stressed there was nothing wrong
with the security council's decision as it was not a precedent for future
business. CDU and CSU called the governments policy contradictory. The FDP
demanded Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer`s resignation because he was
unable to stand his point in the security council. In a TV interview on the
ARD chain Fischer demanded a higher readiness for compromises on both sides
for future export decisions, else the storage of common interests within
the coalition would be used up quickly.

Lambsdorff for increase of forced labourer fund
</H1>
The German government's commissioner for a compensation of Nazi forced
labourers, Otto Graf Lambsdorff, advocates an increase of the fund. Graf
Lambsdorff said in Berlin an increase of the current offer of 6 billion DM
was necessary for an agreement. He had discussed this with Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder and the faction leaders. According to a WDR report, the
lawyers of the forced-labourers had reduced their demands on the German
government and the German industry from 28 billion US$ to 12 billion US$.
This was four times the amount of the German offer noted the American
lawyer Housefeld (sp?).

Protests against austerity package in 180 German cities
</H1>
In 180 German cities unemployment associations, churches and welfare
organizations have protested against the government's austerity package. A
spokesperson of the Coordination of Unionized Unemployed Workers said in
Bielefeld that almost 25% of all measures were affecting the unemployed.
This had nothing to do with social justice. The German Federation of Civil
Servants has paid its members 50 DM for taking part in the rallies against
the government's policy of saving and reimbursed their travel expenses. The
organization's head, Mr. Geier (sp?) said, the civil servants had to
sacrifice a day of holiday to take part in the protests.
