Schaeuble is still optimistic about a tax reform compromise
</H1>
The tax-reform did not happen, and yesterday's and today's reactions show
clearly how far the two sides were - and still are - apart. Mr Schaeuble,
of the CDU/CSU, puts on a brave and optimistic face: he thinks the reforms
will happen, in 2000 at the latest, according to a newspaper-interview.
Why? The SPD opposition will not want to be seen to be driving up
unemployment by throwing spanners in the works or by being uncooperative.

<P>
Mr Schaeuble also critised Lower Saxony's premier Schroeder (SPD). He
claimed that Mr Schroeder had just jumped ship when the going got rough,
and kept talking about things without doing something. Mr Lafontaine, SPD,
wanted to put a stop to the tax-reforms and call for early federal
elections. This would be what the vast majority of the population would
prefer, too. It would be a disgrace to give millionaires large tax-breaks
and at the same time rip off pensioners, commuters and shift-workers.

Zwickel wants collective agreement on part-time retirement
</H1>
Head of metal and engineering union IG Metall Klaus Zwickel wants to press
for a collcetive agreement on part-time retirement by strike if necessary.
If the employers are not to prepared to negotiate a solution the union
would have a strike ballot in September in the North Wuerttemberg/North
Baden region, Zwickel said in Frankfurt on Main. Without an additional
collective agreement the law on part-time retirement was likely to become a
flop. In North Wuerttemberg/North Baden collective bargaining talks have
been suspended on June 25 without result. Employers had demanded that
companies could offer part-time retirement voluntarily while IG Metall is
striving for a obligatory part-time retirement.

available on the Internet, such as telebanking, teleworking and
transaction-processing. Digital signatures are to boost safety, but
government will have to provide some orders-in-council to put digital

that until September.

"Colonia Dignidad" under pressure
</H1>
The controversial sect "Colonia Dignidad", founded and run by German-born
Paul Schaefer, is getting more and more into hot water. In order to escape
arrest by the police in Chile, Mr Schaefer had gone into hiding a while
ago, and his deputy plus some members now followed suit, crossing the
border into Argentina. Last night Mr Hartmut Hopp, the second-in-charge and
the sect's so-called Foreign Minister, fled to Argentina, accompanied by
his wife, Ms Dorothea Withan, and his adopted son Michael as well as a
servant and a man called Friedhelm Zeitner. Mr Hopp was to be arrested
today for fraud. Allegedly he had taken his adopted son from an illiterate
mother, pretending he was very ill and required an urgent operation. The
mother was tricked into signing both the consent-form (for her son's
operation) and adoption-papers. The child subsequently had been sexually
violated and later made to marry Dorothea Withan (who was 15 years older
than the bride-groom). Mr Hopp currently resides in Mendoza in the
Argentinian Andes.

Arrest warrant for Tengelmann blackmailer
</H1>
Today the person allegedly trying to hold supermarket-chain
Tengelmann to ransom was arrested. The 30-year old unemployed man admitted
to his wrong-doing. He had asked for 5 million marks, threatening to poison
food in the Tengelmann supermarkets. He had asked for (and got) several
credit-cards which he used to withdraw a couple of thousand marks from
automatic teller-machines before he was arrested. Apparently he was in debt
up to the hilt.
