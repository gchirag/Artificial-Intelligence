parliament in the coming elections. The two-day conference was described
by Mr. Stadler as being a significant step forward. Mr. Stadler also
spoke out in favor of exposing what he called the striking contradiction
in
the Christian Social Union (CSU), otherwise the Bonn Governing coalition
could suffer even more damage. Mr. Stadler said that both the opposition
parties in Bavarian state parliament (the SPD and the Greens) had no
effective policy for constructive cooperation. Conference delegates also
elected Gisela Bock, the Vice-President of the Bavarian FDP, to the post
of General Secretary of the party. She obtained 99 percent of the vote.
Mr. Stadler's position as head of the Bavarian FDP was also confirmed
