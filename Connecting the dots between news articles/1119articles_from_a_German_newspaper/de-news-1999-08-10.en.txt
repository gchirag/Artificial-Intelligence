Struck reiterates his point in tax dispute
</H1>
In the internal dispute within the Social Democrats (SPD), its
faction leader in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), Peter Struck
has reinforced his call for a reorientation of the party. The old motto
of a workers' party - to take from the rich and to give to the poor - did
not fit a modern society, said Mr Struck at a TV interview. Mr Struck
also called for a complete overhaul of the tax system, though he did no
longer fight for the FDP model with only three tax rates of 15, 25 and
35 per cent, previously supported by him. Instead, Mr Struck called on
the government to implement after 2002 a tax reform that deserves the name.

Reintroduction of wealth tax abandoned
</H1>
The plans to reintroduce the wealth tax are now totally abandoned.
The red-green coalition government in the State of Schleswig-Holstein
that planned to initiated such a reintroduction of the tax in the
Bundesrat (upper house of parliament) today withdraw its bill. The SPD
faction leader in the state's parliament, Mr Hay, said the project
failed because it did not get the support of the majority among the
German states. Neither will the state Schleswig-Holstein introduce the
tax just on itself. Instead, Mr Hay now strongly supports an increase
in the inheritance tax. In his opinion, private assets above DM one
million should be taxed more heavily. SPD faction leader in the
Bundestag (lower house of parliament) Peter Struck, too, supports
such an increase in the inheritance tax. Mr Struck said at an
interview in the weekly "Stern", for heirs of third degree tax
allowances should be decreased, and tax rates be increased.

Baden-Wuerttemberg too collects more taxes
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg too has collected more taxes this year
than was hitherto expected, finance minister Mr Stratthaus announced. Up
to the end of July, 23 billion DM in taxes were collected, which is
approximately 880 million DM, or close to 4 percent, more than was
previously assumed. Despite the positive figures, Mr Strathaus warned

revenue is based on the favourable economic situation of the past year.
It is unclear whether this development will continue.
