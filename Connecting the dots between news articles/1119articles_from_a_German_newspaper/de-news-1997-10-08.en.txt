Suspects in abduction of Matthias Hinze in custody
</H1>
Investigators are apparently near to having solved the case of abduction
of 20-year-old Matthias Hinze. The police director in charge of the case,
Schulthais, announced in Potsdam this afternoon that two Russians, who are
now in custody, have been charged. Voice and handwriting comparisons
provide supporting evidence that the two men are identical with the
kidnappers. Schulthais said that the Public Prosecutor's Office would be
applying for warrants for the arrest of the two men, on suspicion of
kidnapping.
Following the seizure of the suspects, police are now worried about the
survival of the victim, even as they continue to search for the place
Hinze was being held. It is thought to be significant for the search that
the men now in custody served in the Soviet Army stationed in former East
Germany. The kidnappers had always threatened that the victim would starve
to death if they were arrested.

Stoiber criticizes position paper on the euro
</H1>
Bavarian Premier Stoiber has issued sharp criticism of a paper from the
CDU/CSU parliamentary group about its position regarding the introduction
of the euro. The contents of the paper do not correspond to the position
of the CSU, Stoiber told the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper. He said
that the text, rejecting any delay whatsoever in the introduction of
monetary union, goes against previous decisions by the two sister Union
parties. He said that parliamentary group leader Schaeuble was wrong in
thinking that the stability criteria had lost importance. For Stoiber, the
stability criteria are what must determine the timing , and there is still
the possibility of delaying monetary union.
The parliamentary leader of the CSU, Glos, was one of the signatories of
the paper.

Public officials to contribute to pension fund
</H1>
German officials are to begin contributing to their own pension fund in
1999. The federal cabinet approved a bill to that effect today. The bill
provides for a deduction of 0.2 percent, off any negotiated wage agreement
for other public sector employees, for officials over the next 15 years.
That money will go into pension funds. It is expected that the savings to
the pension system realized in this way will amount to DM 66 billion over
that time.
At the same time, bonuses for officials are to be cut, semi-retirement for
police and firefighters will be restricted, and wages for candidates
trying to obtain the designation of "official" will be lowered by 5
percent.

German Armed Forces transport planes to get collision warning device
</H1>
All transport planes of the German armed forces are to be outfitted with
collision warning devices. Defence Minister Ruehe made the announcement
today. Adding the device to the 107 aircraft is expected to cost about DM

A new report from the Ministry of Defence traces that accident back to
inadequacies in flight security in Angola.
