BfA: Pensions will continue to remain secure
</H1>
According to the Federal Social Insurance Office for Salaried
Employees (BfA), pensions in the future will continue to remain secure.
The president of the BfA, Rische, said in an interview that the present
old-age pension insurance system has been in existance and functioning for
100 years. With necessary and sensible adjustments, it will continue to
function for another 100 years. Further, he said that to date there had
been no practical alternative which could have made possible a transition
to a new system for one, and that was affordable, for another. In addition,
the costs of the proposed basic federal pension have at this stage not been
precisely calculated. The BfA estimates, however, that a basic pension
system would cost more than the revenue earned from sales tax. Mr Rische
said, furthermore, that he rejects the notion that pensions should be
privately financed. The consensus remains that the workforce carries the
responsibility for financing old-age pensions.

Economic and financial policies criticised
</H1>
The chairman of the board of the Deutsche Bank, Kopper, has criticised the
German government's economic and financial policies according to a report
in the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag". Mr. Kopper said in a talk in January
to CDU and SPD politicians in Bonn that there is a lack of coordination
between the responsible ministries. The economics portfolio did not
contain enough impetus or initiative. As far as financial policy is
concerned, Mr Kopper also rejects drastic austerity measures. He considers
the goal of leading politicians' to halve unemployment by the year 2000 to
be unrealistic.

Considerations regarding essential health-care benefits
</H1>
Statutory health insurance is to continue to pay for massages, private
nursing and a number of preventative measures. However, the criteria for
establishing medical necessity will be stricter said a health-care
spokesman for the CDU/CSU, Lohmann, to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag".
According to Mr Lohmann, health insurances, doctors and professional
organizations had got together to determine which treatments were
applicable for which illnesses. Certain medication and treatments will not
generally be paid for by health insurance, rather only when they are
considered effective according to the newly defined schedule of benefits.

Wilhelm calls for improved protection of children
</H1>
The CDU member of parliament, Wilhelm, wants to better protect
children against criminal acts by the use of mini-transmitters. He said to
the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that such transmitters could be hidden in
childrens' schoolbooks, clothing or jewellery. If kidnapped, the children
could then be more easily traced. Greater protection could be attained by
implanting electronic microchips under the skin. The Federal Minister of
Research has promised to look into Mr Wilhelm's idea.
