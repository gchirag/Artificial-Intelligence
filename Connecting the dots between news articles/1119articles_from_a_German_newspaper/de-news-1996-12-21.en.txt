Greens Will Not Coalesce with PDS
</H1>
Coalescing with the PDS would be out of the question during
the next few years, states leadership spokeswoman of Alliance
90/The Greens, Ms. Roestel.  The party congress of the Greens
in Suhl gave an unambiguous signal concerning the year 1998,
Ms. Roestel told the  MAGDEBURGER VOLKSSTIMME on Sunday.  To
be sure, no decision could be reached at this time concerning
the situation at the end of the millennium.  Ms. Roestel
emphasized that the possibility that the PDS might change its
outlook should not be ruled out.  The party should not be
forced into playing the role of martyr, which the CDU did
with its "red socks campaign."  The Coalition Greens member
of the Bundestag, Mr. Poppe, declared that he would turn his
back on his party in the event of a coalition with the PDS.
To be sure, he considered such a coalition impossible, Mr.
Poppe told the BERLINER MORGENPOST.  This was the reaction of
the former DDR-citizens' rights advocate to delegates'
Laengsfeld and other former DDR-Opponents' conversion to the
CDU.

Protestant Church Objects to Search of Parish Rooms
</H1>
The leadership of the Protestant Church [Evangelische
Kirche] in Berlin-Brandenburg  has lodged a protest against
the Prosecutor's Office search of parish rooms. The church
leadership declared that this occurrence was a singular one
in the history of the Federal Republic and constituted  the
exacerbation of the State's  policies in regard to
congregations which offered their protection to refugees in
danger of deportation.  The action in Berlin at the beginning
of December had been against the members of a congregational
council who are said to have granted church asylum for a year
to a Vietnamese person.

Major Fire In Munich's "Euroindustriepark"
</H1>
A major fire occurred in a warehouse of the European
Industrial Park [Euroindustriepark] in the north of Munich.
Evidently, the fire department had major problems
in controlling the blaze.  Hours after its outbreak, the fire
was not completely put out.  The flames also touched
adjoining buildings.  The cause of the fire has not been
determined as yet.
Only after more than five hours,  was the leader of the fire
fighters able to report that the fire was under control.  It
still had not been put out at the time of this report.
Replacements were requested in the morning for the 120
professional and volunteer fire fighters.  It has not been
determined as yet why the fire broke out around 1:30 A.M. in
the building measuring 5000 square meters.  At any rate, when
the first fire fighters arrived, the flames, already several
meters high, were already shooting out of the building which
could not be entered a few minutes later because it was about
to collapse.  The fire-proof walls failed to prevent the
flames from spreading rapidly from the construction warehouse
of a roofing company to the neighboring buildings.  At this
time, the firefighters, using hoses among other devices, were
able to combat the flames only from the outside.  It has not
been determined when investigators from the Munich criminal
police will be able to enter the site to investigate the
cause of the fire.  The Munich fire department stated that
damages will run in the millions.
