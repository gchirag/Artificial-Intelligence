Analysis of Hamburg election results
</H1>
Former First Mayor of Hamburg Henning Voscherau wants to
substantially reduce his activity in politics. During a press
conference at the SPD headquarters in Bonn, Voscherau announced he
would also resign from his position as SPD negotiator for finance
politics in the Bundesrat (upper house of parliament). It stands to
see whether he will participate one last time in Thursday's
discussions about tax reform in the mediation committee.
The current senator for finance, Ortwin Runde, is the person most
often named as Voscherau's successor. Before assuming his present
post, Runde  headed the Social Welfare Office for many years. Runde
has detailed knowledge of Hamburg's problems and the internal
workings of the governing party and would probably be capable of
heading a red/green coalition government. His one handicap is that
he is not the charismatic orator who can present himself to the
public and to the media as Voscherau could. This might rather be
expected from the current senator for environmental affairs, Fritz
Vahrenholt. But the latter belongs to the right wing of the party
and might not easily agree to a red/green cooperation. Voscherau
himself also considers his close collaborator, Thomas Mirow, a
possible successor.
The Hamburg SPD achieved its worst post-war election result with
36.2% of votes. Preliminary analyses attribute this fact to the SPD
campaign. Centering the election campaign on internal security
proved disastrous for SPD. In districts with a high crime rate, high
unemployment rates, and high percentages of foreigners, many voters
switched over to the Green-Alternative List (GAL) and to the radical
right-wing DVU. REP-voters this time gave a strategic vote to DVU.
Wherever the SPD lost votes, the CDU gained (30.7%); SPD voters and
blu-collar workers turned their backs on the party. The CDU also
succeeded in recovering votes formerly lost to the STATT party.
STATT, DVU, and FDP did not achieve the 5% of the vote necessary to
win seats in the state parliament.

Analysis of Hamburg election results by Bonn
</H1>
After the Hamburg State elections, party headquarters in Bonn
and in Hamburg presented their analyses. The CDU is getting
optimistic: In spite of the reform bottleneck in Bonn, the party
increased its share of the votes in Hamburg. Party Chairman and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl sees this as a positive sign for next year's
national elections. Kohl's hope is that the SPD will form a "grand
coalition" with the Christian Democrats in Hamburg.
The SPD is still discussing the consequences of yesterday's defeat.
The Social Democrats need a new first mayor as well as a new
financial coordinator for the tax debates with the ruling coalition
in Bonn, an office from which Voscherau also intends to resign.

SPD discusses Voscherau's succession
</H1>
The SPD state executive board met to discuss the succession
of former First Mayor Henning Voscherau. Voscherau had said that his
resignation should make it easier for the party to make a new start
after Sunday's electoral defeat. Meanwhile, the CDU commented on the
election results in Hamburg as being the logical consequence of the
SPD's blocking tactics in the matters of tax and social security
reforms. They consider the result of the elections as proof of the
fact that citizens don't like blocking tactics.
SPD national chairman Oskar Lafontaine declared that the Hamburg
results had nothing to do with Bonn's tax policy - a clear sign that
the Social Democrats do not intend to change their course.

Green Party counts on red-green coalition in Hamburg
</H1>
The Green party expects a red/green coalition in Hamburg as a
consequence of election results. This was declared by both Ms.
Roessel, spokeswoman for the national board of the Green party, and
Krista Sager, Hamburg's top GAL candidate. Both consider a red/green
coalition in Hamburg to be an excellent starting signal for a change
of power in Bonn. They expressly warn against a "grand coalition"
between SPD and CDU in Hamburg, which would only strengthen the
right wing.

Temporary workers have no guarantee for continuous employment
</H1>
Persons who had contracts to substitute for an employee who
is temporarily off the job cannot claim a right to continued
employment. This was a basic decision issued by the Federal Labour
Court.
The court reasoned that the employer had an undissolved employment
contract with the temporarily absent employee, who had a right to
return to the job. A temp worker cannot claim to be accepted into an
unlimited employment situation.

Ghana citizen dies of Lassa fever
</H1>
Health authorities are looking nationwide for about 50
persons who had contact with a Ghana citizen who died of Lassa fever
in Mainz on Saturday. Lassa fever is a potentially deadly disease if
not detected in time. It is also highly contagious. The deceased
patient had been to Wiesbaden and Duesseldorf.
Lassa fever is mainly transmitted by rats. Infection between humans
is less dramatic. There are no working vaccines at this time. The
mortality rate is 15 to 20%, according to the Robert Koch Institute;
other sources claim a mortality rate of as high as 30%. As the
mortal disease is transmitted by way of bodily fluids, e.g., during
sexual intercourse, authorities are now on the lookout for persons
who had close contact with the man from Ghana.

The Bundeswehr Tupolev that collided with a U.S. plane off
Namibia was off the course set down in the flight schedule. This is
the finding of an investigation presented by Minister for Defense
Volker Ruehe. Ghana flight safety agreed to the change. Also, the
flight elevation as stated in the flight schedule did not completely
comply with international regulations. According to Ruehe, it is
still to early to attribute culpabilities.

The Consumer Association of North Rhine-Westphalia accused a large
number of credit institutes of transgressing regulations when it
comes to authorize loans to minors. For instance, many banks waive
