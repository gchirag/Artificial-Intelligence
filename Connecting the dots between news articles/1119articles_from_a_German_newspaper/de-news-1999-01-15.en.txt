Getting out of nuclear power raises hackles
</H1>
Government is planning to get out of nuclear power, and that is
guaranteed to raise someone's hackles. The power generators thinks that
changing the laws about nuclear power would cast a big shadow over
the planned consensual talks at the end of January. Preussen-Elektra
threatened to take government to court over the planned ban on reprocessing
nuclear fuel-rods as of this year. According to CEO Haarig, technical
and economical reasons as well as the law were against putting a stop to
reprocessing as early as this year. At the same time, he warned against
an excessive number of shipments of (reprocessed) nuclear material from
France and Great Britain back to Germany

Nuclear power policy causes concern abroad, too
</H1>
Government's nuclear power policy has caused some concern abroad,
too. France and Britain may ask for billions of marks in damages, in case
existing re-processing contracts are cancelled before time. Minister
Trittin, however, said he could not see any lawful reasons for that, after
having had talks with France. At the same time he guaranteed that Germany
would take back their own nuclear waste, generated during re-processing at
La Hague/France.

Metal-workers' award-talks postponed without having reached an agreement
</H1>
Award-talks for approximately 840,000 metal workers in the
South-West of Germany have been postponed without having reached an
agreement. The employers did not make an offer in round two, and that's why
some 40,000 workers downed tools for a short while. Both sides agreed on new
talks on 28 January, which happens to be when the ban on industrial action
('cooling-off period') runs out. Unions are asking for a 6.5% rise, for East
and West Germany.

CDU starts collecting signatures
</H1>
In spite of heavy criticism, the CDU started collecting signatures
against the planned dual citizenship laws. The CDU-party is against
foreigners taking out German citizenship while keeping their existing
passport/citizenship. The unions once again accused them of fanning
xenophobia, the hate of foreigners/things foreign. According to government,
some 2 million foreigners are expected to take out German citizenship
according to the (planned) new legislation.
