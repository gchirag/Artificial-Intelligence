Bundestag again discusses austerity package
</H1>
Today, the Bundestag again dealt with the welfare laws relating to the
savings measures.  After the mediation committee between Bundestag and
Bundesrat [Upper House of Parliament] last Monday had rejected the law and
demanded that corresponding resolutions be annulled, the coalition's majority
of CDU/CSU and FDP today overruled the committee's vote.  The debate was
scheduled to last four hours.  During the parliamentary debate, the parties
of the opposition accused the government of running a course of
confrontation.  The SPD representative Dressler said in Bonn today that the
measures are economically wrong and threaten the coherence of society.  In
the opinion of The Greens' spokesperson for social policy, Ms. Fischer, the
government itself has caused the precarious situation on the job market.
Economics Minister Rexrodt defended the austerity plans for which there are
no alternatives.  Employment Minister Bluem accused the SPD of blocking
policy and of unwillingness to compromise.

Israel is urged to show more sensitivity and responsibility
</H1>
The representative of the Autonomous Palestinian Authority to Bonn,
Mr. Franji, has urged the Israeli Government to more sensitivity and
responsibility in view of the peace process in the Near East.  He said on
Deutschlandfunk radio this morning that a meeting between Israel's Minister
President Netanyahu and the Palestinian President Arafat is critically
advised, given the current tensions.  Franji views the demolition of a
Palestinian care center for disabled people in East Jerusalem as a sign that
Netanyahu somewhat disdains the Autonomous Palestinian Rule.  Franji
continued saying that in this situation, Arafat should make it clear that the
Palestinians' patience has reached its limits and that they are not willing
to yield in the questions of Jerusalem and of the expansion of Jewish
settlements.  Arafat had called for a general strike to protest against
Israel's measures.  Stores and offices remained closed for four hours this
morning, not only affecting the West Jordan territories and the Gaza strip
but also East Jerusalem.

projected DM 60 billion.  In coalition circles it was said today that the
deficit will be by 10 to 15 billion DM higher.  Finance Minister Waigel

give numbers.  The reasons for the bigger budget deficit are high

Discussion about repatriation of Bosnia refugees
</H1>
The representative of the UN refugee organization in Germany has appealed to
the federal government and to the states to not begin repatriating refugees
from Bosnia-Herzegovina as soon as October 1st.  In an interview with the
"Neuen Osnabruecker Zeitung" newspaper she said that the postponement of
municipal elections in Bosnia had created insecurities on the local level
which delays the return of the people.  Several local politicians were waging
a cold war which aimed at constructing ethnically clean miniature states.
Federal and State Ministers intend to convene on September 19 in order to
agree on a definitive starting date for repatriating refugees from Bosnia.
The Ministers of Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia told the ddp/adn news agency
they opt for starting the campaign not before next spring.

Sex offenders to be rigorously prosecuted and convicted
</H1>
Family Minister Ms. Nolte has again called for rigorous prosecution and
conviction of sex offenders.  Sexual abuse of minors in no trivial offense,
the CDU politician emphasized on Deutschlandfunk radio this morning.  In the
interest of effective prevention, the subject must lose its taboo stigma.

as passed by the World Women Convention in Stockholm yesterday.  She said it
would give a guideline for action for every country, aiming at enhanced
international cooperation in particular.  The convention at Stockholm
continued today with expert consultations, discussing options to prevent the
prostitution of children and child pornography.
