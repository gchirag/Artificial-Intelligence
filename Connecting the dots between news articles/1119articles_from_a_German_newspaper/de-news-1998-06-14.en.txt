Diverging opinions on Kosovo deployment within German government
</H1>
There seem to be divergent opinions on a NATO deployment in Kosovo
within the German government. At issue is the underlying international
law concerning military intervention. Changing his stand compared to
previous statements, German Minister of Defense Volker Ruehe now says
that a mandate from the UN Security Council is not necessary. He said in
a newspaper interview that he now feels that the current legal situation
is sufficient. Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, on the contrary, insists on
the necessity of a mandate from the United Nations. Anything else, the
Minister says, is legally not tenable.
