Mediation committee discusses severity measures
</H1>
The Bundestag/Bundesrat mediation committee began decisive consultations on the
government's severity measures. Proposed changes in job security protection and
sick pay are particularly controversial. The special meeting on the severity
measures marked the end of the summer break for Bonn politicians. Various
politicians have indicated that there is only a slim chance to reach
compromises regarding the controversial laws. Oskar Lafontaine, head of the
SPD, and Rudolf Scharping, leader of the parliamentary opposition, expect the
SPD majority in the Bundesrat to stick to its rejection of the controversial
parts in order to make clear that the SPD demands a different kind of politics.
However, the Social Democrat minister president of Rhineland-Palatinate, Beck,
saw chances for compromises. No matter how long the negotiations in the
mediations committee will take, the parliamentary schedule indicates that the
Bundestag will probably reject the Bundesrat's objection to the severity
measures on September 13 and thus clear the path for the laws to be passed.

Retail wage dispute continues
</H1>
Negotiations for the 500,000 retail trade workers continued in Essen today.
According to the DAG union, the talks had been postponed for an hour following
a request from the employers. The HBV union had quit the negotiations last
Tuesday because of their demand for bonuses for work performed at night, which
the DAG did not support. A union spokesperson confirmed at a meeting of the
great wage commission in Duisburg that the HVB would not participate in the
next round of negotiations. More than 1000 retail workers in six cities
followed an HBV call and went on strike temporarily. In Berlin, about 350
department store employees went on a short strike.

Biedenkopf denies blackmailing by VW
</H1>
The minister president of Saxony, Kurt Biedenkopf, denies having been
blackmailed by VW in the dispute over subsidies. The relationship between VW
and the state of Saxony was marked by cooperation, not blackmailing, Biedenkopf
said in Dresden  before a meeting with the head of VW, Piech. Saxony is taking
the EU commission to court at the European Supreme Court. Despite the
commission's prohibition, Saxony had paid VW about 91 million marks in
subsidies.

</H1>
Regarding the VW subsidy dispute in Saxony, federal minister Rexrodt intends to
suggest to the federal cabinet to file suit against the European Union. Rexrodt
told PRO 7 TV that a direct suit filed by the federal government would mean
that Bonn could approach the European Supreme Court's highest instance
directly. The EU commission is now preparing legal procedures against the
Federal Republic.

CSU demands future participation in political top positions
</H1>
The Bavarian CSU no longer wants to limit itself to a minor role in top
government positions. When the Christian Union will look for new candidates for
the positions of chancellor or president in the future, the CSU must no longer
be overlooked, the state party leader Michael Glos demanded. He immediately
clarified that this claim to the highest federal positions was not aimed at
Helmut Kohl or Roman Herzog. However, once Kohl and Herzog retired from
politics, it must be possible for the CSU to claim one of these positions. With
Theo Waigel as finance minister, the CSU is already more influential on a
federal level than ever, Glos said.

Merkel warns against global decline in soil quality
</H1>
The minister for the environment, Ms. Merkel, warned about the global decline
in soil quality. It is probably more dramatic than assumed at the 1992
environmental summit in Rio de Janeiro 1992, Merkel said at the opening of an
international conference on soil protection in Bonn and pointed out that even
the German environmental laws do not yet protect soil.

1995 annual report of customs authority
</H1>
424 live snakes and turtles, illegally imported in two private vehicles, were
confiscated by Bavarian customs officers in late July. Federal finance minister
Waigel said at the presentation of the 1995 report of the customs authority,
the spectacular discovery proved the increasing significance of the species
protection department in customs. He was also concerned about cigarette
smuggling. A special commission is hunting the criminal kingpins. 730 million
confiscated cigarettes are only the tip of a billion-mark business. Anyone
smoking cheaply bought smuggled cigarettes is liable to punishment, Waigel
emphasized. Despite similar and well-known laws regarding drugs, 1.6 metrics
tons of cocaine and 9 metric tons of marihuana were confiscated last year. New
technology, such as 36,000 drug detectors and an x-ray device for ship
containers at the Hamburg main customs office, as well as about 40 mobile
customs checking groups are supposed to replace the missing customs checks at
all German borders except those to the east.
