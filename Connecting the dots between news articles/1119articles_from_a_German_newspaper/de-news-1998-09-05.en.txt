Greens find conditions for coalition negotiations unacceptable
</H1>
The Greens have warned SPD candidate for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
about making conditions for coalition negotiations. Ms. Roestl, speaker
of the Executive Committee, told Deutschlandfunk public radio that it is
unacceptable for the SPD to set up detailed guidelines in order to begin
talks on a coalition. Schroeder, in turn,  said in an interview to the
newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that he is not willing to have a red-green
coalition at any cost. He added that he is prepared to ask for a maximum
increase of six pfennigs on gas prices but that is as far as he would
go. The minister president of Lower Saxony is still committed to having
Expo 2000 in Hanover. On the program "Interview of the Week" on
Deutschlandfunk, Mr. Schroeder said that he and Helmut Kohl are in
complete agreement on this issue.  Canceling the event would be a
disgrace for Germany, he added.
