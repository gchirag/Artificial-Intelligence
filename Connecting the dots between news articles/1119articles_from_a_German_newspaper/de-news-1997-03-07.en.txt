Less to do for compulsory unemployment- and pension-insurance schemes?
</H1>
Government allegedly wants to rid the compulsory unemployment- and
pension-insurance schemes of 25 to 30 billion marks worth of tasks they
currently are responsible for. According to the newspaper BERLINER ZEITUNG,
sales- and excise-duty on motor-spirits will rise to make up shortfalls, and
that would have been agreed to by top politicians of the coalition parties
and the FDP.

<P>
Minister Bluem's proposal to lower pensions from currently 70 to 64% (mainly
based on your last pay) until the year 2030, plus granting subsidies to the
pension scheme, was discussed by the CDU-party today. Mr Bluem's proposal to
set up a so-called family-fund seems to be doomed from the start. Mr Bluem
himself is against a so-called basic pension (regardless of contributions).
Saxony's state premier Biedenkopf, however, is very much for the latter, and
put up more details for discussion. According to him this should replace the
existing system.

Reactions to plans to cut coal-mining subsidies
</H1>
Government's plans to cut subsidies for coal-mining raised
miners', unions' and the SPD-party's hackles. Miners occupied mines and
demonstrated against planned job losses. All mines in the Ruhr and the Saar
regions stopped work. The coal-mining states of North-Rhine/Westphalia and
Saar asked the federal government to scrap their plans.

Mr Kinkel in Jerusalem
</H1>
Foreign Minister Kinkel met Israel's head of state Netanyahu and
Palestinian head of state Arafat. Mr Netanyahu defended Israel's decision to
build a Jewish quarter in the (Arab-controlled) eastern part of Jerusalem.
Mr Kinkel, however, confirmed that he had reservations about the matter.
This issue re-surfaced in the talks with Mr Arafat, who also criticised
Israel's withdrawal from more parts of the West-Jordan region as not being
enough.

Equal treatment of women and men at work and in society
</H1>
Tomorrow is International Women's Day, and politicians and associations
asked for more equal treatment of women and men at work and in society.
According to the minister, Ms Nolte, there had been progress but there is
no reason why we should be content with the actual state of affairs.
Unions asked for the distribution of work and income to be more just and
respecting the principles of solidarity.

Trial of Ms Fleuchaus' kidnappers
</H1>
Nicola Fleuchaus and Susanne Siegfried identified their alleged kidnapper
in court. Yesterday Ms Siegfried was cross-examined for almost two hours.
She recognised Julio Cesar Vega without fail, but was unable to confirm that
the 32-year old man actually was the head of the gang of kidnappers, as
police had claimed. She described Mr Vega as her guardian angel, who would
have helped her and Ms Fleuchaus save their lives, if the ransom-deal had
failed. They also touched on the issue of the photos showing Ms Fleuchaus
kissing Mr Vega. "I don't know when Ms Fleuchaus and Mr Vega became more than
friendly, though he was the only one to drop his mask as early as 10 days
after the kidnapping." In spite of a court summons, Ms Fleuchaus was absent.
According to her lawyer, Mr Rilling, she already had made depositions at the
Costa Rica embassy in Bonn last May, and identified two perpetrators on
photos. She wanted to be left in peace now. And, according to Costa Rican
law, she would have had to pay the airfare to Costa Rica herself, which
would have been unacceptable.

Stuttgart public servant taken to court once again
</H1>
Mr Benno Buble, former public servant, was taken to court once
again for alleged graft. Last October his first trial had been aborted when
the public prosecutor had swamped the court with literally last-minute
submissions for evidence, wreaking havoc to the court's roster. Mr Buble had
been a member of the state lottery's advisory board, and gone on a
business-trip to Brussels, together with his wife and other members. At the
time Mr Buble had applied for retirement, having learned that the district
court would begin investigating the matter. As the business-trip was a bit
'touristy' as well, Mr Buble and other travellers were taken to court.
Mr Buble thinks he is not guilty, and the business-trip to Brussels is not
a matter for the penal court.

Investigations begin on how police shot and killed motorist on the run
</H1>
The Stuttgart public prosecutor began investigations after
a firearm had been discharged killing an unarmed motorist, stating that there
had been no apparent reason for using a firearm. A week ago three
police-officers had shot and killed a 32-year old man. They had stopped him
near Esslingen after having followed him for some 20 kilometres. So far
it is unknown which of the three officers actually fired the shot.
