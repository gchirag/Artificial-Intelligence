Scharping denies plans for ground troops in Kosovo
</H1>
According to German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping, NATO is not planning
on using ground troops in Kosovo. Mr. Scharping told journalists that
reports to the contrary are not true. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
stressed that, for now, NATO will stick to the strategy of continuous air
attacks against Yugoslavia. The Secretary General did not want to preclude
the possibility of using soldiers in Kosovo later, though, and he is sure
that all members of the alliance would participate in the use of ground
troops. Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov is convinced that NATO is
secretly preparing for the use of ground troops. A week ago, US Secretary
of Defense Robert Cohen declared that there have long been plans for the
use of ground troops.

<P>
SPD politician Mr. Bahr said on "Suedwestfunk" radio that the use of ground
troops should be rejected no matter what, because the price is too high and
the consequences are unpredictable. The Bavarian SPD has come out in favor
of a NATO cease fire. An official pronouncement of the State Executive
Board of the party stated that negotiations should be the goal.

NATO continues air attacks on Yugoslavia
</H1>
NATO considers that it has severely damaged the Yugoslavian air defense. A
NATO spokesman said that the Yugoslavian air defense had been seriously
degraded and now has to improvise its activities. NATO attacked targets in
Yugoslavia again last night [Saturday], destroying 13 Yugoslavian tanks and
continued air attacks the following afternoon, as well. According to the
Yugoslavian news agency "Tanjug", targets northwest of Kosovo's capital
Pristina were attacked. Several thousand people in the NATO member states
Spain and Greece demonstrated against the air raids on Yugoslavia.

Wave of atrocities against Kosovo Albanians
</H1>
NATO is speaking of a new wave of atrocities against Kosovo Albanians. The
alliance has accused the Yugoslavian army of expelling more and more people
out of their villages, ransacking and then burning their houses. The
Yugoslavian army, however, denies these accusations. The International War
Criminal Tribunal in the Hague wants to step up investigation into war
crimes. To that end, refugees who have been brought to Germany will be
interrogated soon. NATO alleges that it has aerial photos of 43 supposed
mass graves in Kosovo. A spokesman for the alliance also said that there is
evidence that Kosovo Albanians are being forced to bury the bodies of their
own people. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)
has reported that five refugees died, among them three children, at the
northern Albanian border crossing of Morina. Their car hit a land mine and
exploded just a few meters from the border.

Coalition fight about 30 km/h speed limit
</H1>
A new bone of contention regarding city speed limits has arisen within the
governing coalition. A representative of the Green Party within the German
Ministry of the Environment, Gisela Altmann, has demanded that the
coalition agreement be honored. The coalition agreement generally provides
that the speed on city streets must be limited to 30 km/h and that only
roads with right of way can have a speed limit of up to 50 km/h. On the
other hand, Traffic Minister Mr. Muentefering, a member of the SPD, has
proposed that the individual cities should be allowed to decide what speed
limit to use.

Mueller rejects increase of value added tax
</H1>
German Minister of the Economy Mr. Mueller has again advocated significant
reform of tax and finance policies. Pointing to the "desolate state of the
public coffers," Mr. Mueller said it was necessary to reduce government
expenditure, increase income and lessen the peoples' expectations of what
the government should do. The Minister has rejected an increase of value
added tax. During an event in Duesseldorf, the Minister, who is not
affiliated with a political party, said that this tax is basically financed
through work and can lead to reduced private consumption. Mr. Mueller
instead demanded a reduction in public expenditure, especially subsidies.
Furthermore, Mr. Mueller announced that the government will propose binding
parameters for business tax reform before the summer break.
