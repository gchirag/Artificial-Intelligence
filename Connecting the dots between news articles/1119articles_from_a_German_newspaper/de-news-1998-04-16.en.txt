Sentence against Pastor Geyer announced
</H1>
The murder sentence against Pastor Klaus Geyer was continued in the
morning at the Regional Court in Braunschweig. Geyer is accused of
slaying his wife in the heat of passion. The 20th day of trial began
with two dead ants. One ant was found on the dead body of Veronika Geyer
and the other one was found under a dirty boot the police seized in
Geyer's vehicle. Several experts agreed that the dirt came with great
likelihood from the scene of the crime. A comparison of the two ants is
supposed to reveal whether the two animals are alike and could be from
the crime scene. Delays in the trial are expected if the experts cannot
come to a clear result.

Energy tax: industry fears elimination of jobs
</H1>
Henkel fears the elimination of jobs due to the energy tax. The President
of the Federation of the German Industry rejects the introduction of
so-called energy taxes to make energy more expensive. It would lead to
higher unemployment and prevent investment. A reduction of carbon dioxide
emissions could not be guaranteed with such a tax. The Bavarian State
Premier Stoiber called the discussions about the energy tax unrealistic
and rejected increased costs of energy on a national level.
