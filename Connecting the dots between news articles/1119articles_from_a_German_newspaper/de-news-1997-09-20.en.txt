Cairo bombing without terrorist backing
</H1>
The Egyptian government continues to assert that the
bombing attack on a tourist bus on Thursday was the work of two
madmen. In Cairo, the Minister of the Interior declared that the
two arrested men had no connections with any terrorist
organizations. He said that one of the men had recently run away
from a mental hospital and he had committed this act with his
brother. He added that questioning had failed to offer additional
revelations.

<P>
The German government is not satisfied with this explanation,
however. German detectives are to check out the results of the
investigation.  Nine Germans and the Egyptian bus driver lost their
lives during the bombing. The Federal Government is once again
warning against travel to Egypt.

IMF raises membership dues
</H1>
Hong Kong. The International Monetary Fund is raising the
size of contributions expected from its members. The so-called
quotas will rise by 45%. According to Federal Minister for Finance
Waigel, this is acceptable as far as Germany is concerned. The
monetary fund will receive an addition of approximately 150 billion
marks in its coffers. The additional revenue is to strengthen
economic supports.

<P>
Before this year's economic summit in Hong Kong, the ministers for
finance and the heads of note issuing banks of the seven leading
western industrial nations G7 had conferred about the most recent
monetary turbulences in Asia. On this occasion, Federal Minister
for Finance Waigel rejected any criticism of the monetary fund and
stated that the responsibility lay with the governments of the
countries which had not heeded the warnings of the IMF. An
example: after a severe market decline, Thai currency lost 30% in
its dollar exchange value. The IMF granted Thailand a short term
credit of 17.2 billion dollars.

Ministers of agriculture fear lifting of the beef embargo
</H1>
The German ministers of agriculture are afraid that the
European commission wants to use a backdoor approach to make
British beef acceptable once again. The reason for their fear is
the decision of the EU commission to declare all its member states
as BSE-risk areas.  According to the explanation offered by the
minister for the environment of Rhineland-Palatinate, Ms. Martini,
to the SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the following line of reasoning by the
EU commission is feared: all the countries are areas of risk; all
the countries have the same safety regulations; therefore, it makes
no sense to treat Great Britain differently from the others.

Mr. Kohl appeals to the SPD for cooperation
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Kohl has appealed to the Social Democrats to
stop blocking the taxation and pension reform in Germany. Even
after the meeting of the mediation committee, which made no
progress, the Coalition was ready to make a reasonable compromise,
Mr. Kohl told the WELT AM SONNTAG. He charged that the Social
Democrats were kindling social envy with their blockade and, to
quote exactly, serving their own tactical election agenda. Perhaps
the SPD would come to its senses, Mr. Kohl stated, after the public
elections in Hamburg.

Mr. Schaeuble also wants to raise tax on oil
</H1>
Concerning the disagreement about pension reform, the head
of the CDU/CSU faction, Mr. Schaueble, stated that the CDU/CSU would no
longer resist the idea of raising the tax on mineral oil products.
Mr. Schaeuble said that raising the tax would not constitute a stumbling
block in making a compromise with the SPD. This is the way Mr.
Schaeuble's proposal looks: in order to keep contributions to
pension insurance under 20%, the value added tax is to be raised to
16% and the tax on mineral oil products is to be raised by no more than 15
pfennigs (that is DM0.15) per liter. In connection with this, Mr.
Schaeuble spoke about an ecological tax reform.  He said that it
was economically unsound that energy and raw materials were cheap in
Germany. This had a brake-like effect on introducing new techniques for
energy savings and creating jobs. The SPD welcomed Mr. Schaeuble's
forward movement.  SPD faction leader called it a step in the right
direction.

Rexrodt against "french style" employment policy
</H1>
German minster of economics Rexrodt is against the kind of joint European
employment policy proposed by France. In an interview to Deutschlandfunk
radio station this morning he said he was against it because public
expenditure in this area acted like a flash in the pan and did not bring
much relief for the unemployed. Notwithstanding, he agreed that fighting
unemployment on a European level was class-A priority. The upcoming summit
conference on employment in Luxembourg would certainly show this. He showed
hope that this would lead to improved rapport in the area of economic
policies. In Rexrodt's opinion the monetary union will also tend to improve
the labour market situation.

Norbert Bluem called for continued efforts towards fighting child labour.

allow conciliation of professional activity and family life. Talking to
Deutschlandfunk, Ms. Nolte admitted that, as far as day-long child care was
concerned, Germany was still an underdeveloped country.

Garzweiller II expendable within energy policy framework
</H1>
The controversial open-air lignite mining operation at
Garzweiller II is expendable within the energy policy framework. This is
shown by a study carried out by the Wuppertal Institute for Climate,
Ecology and Energy, cited by the daily Koelner Stadtanzeiger and by
the weekly news magazine Der Spiegel. Electric Power Company RWE is
charged with having exaggerated growth rate projections of power
consumption. This jeopardizes one of the fundamental arguments that
brought about the legal working concession for Garzweiller II.

<P>
Increased mining activities for open-air lignite exploration have been an
eternal matter of discord within North Rhine-Westphalia's red-green State
Government. SPD is in favour of Garzweiller II, the Green Party is against it.

BKA President favours applying US police procedures in Germany
</H1>
The BKA (Federal Criminal Office) President, Mr Kersten, came
out in favour of pilot operations to try out US police procedures in
Germany. He told Deutsche Presseagentur (dpa) news agency that the
strategy of community-integrated police work might lead to an improvement
of quality of life in German cities. However, he warned against limiting
these procedures to increased severity in police action. To effectively
curb minor criminality and vagrancy, political intent and fast action by
the judiciary were also necessary. Mr Kersten went on to say that the
success of the US police force was also due to increased personnel
headcount and modern equipment.

Diana's driver buried at Lorient.
</H1>
In Lorient, in western France, the driver killed in the accident which also
killed Princess Diana was buried in a ceremony marked by severe security
measures. The memorial service was private to family members and close
friends. The body of the 41 year old driver had only recently been liberated
for burial because police authorities had several times ordered additional
blood tests. These tests revealed that the driver not only was inebriated,
but also under the influence of medication which further reduced his driving
ability. Still, it is not established yet whether he alone was reponsible
for the accident. The only survivor of the crash, Princess Diana's
bodyguard, was questioned yesterday, but no new aspects have up to now
come up.
