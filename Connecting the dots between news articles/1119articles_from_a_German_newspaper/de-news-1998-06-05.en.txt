Broken wheel hoop presumably cause of ICE disaster
</H1>
The fatal high-speed train accident in Eschede was presumably caused by a
broken and jammed wheel hoop. The Federal Train Department stated that the
cause for the broken hoop remains completely unclear. Wear and tear could
be excluded and so could attacks. The number ofpeople killed increased to
96 after more bodies were retrieved from the wreckage. Only one body has
been identified so far. The federal government is planning a state funeral
for the dead. Until Friday afternoon German Rail had checked 30 of its 59
first-generation ICE trains for potential damages. The checks caused
delays, cancellations and chaotic conditions at some stations.

Disciplinary action in Stammtisch affair dropped
</H1>
The Badem-Wuerttemberg finance ministry announced today that it has dropped
the disciplinary action against Mr. Merkle, the head of the tax department.
Merkle had violated the tax privacy unintentionally with negligence but the
event had the character of a one-time occasion. One could assume that it
would not be repeated. The prosecution had dropped the case last March
because of little fault. Last year, Merkle had talked about the tax case of
concert organizer Hoffman in a Stuttgart pub.
