Celebration of tenth anniversary of fall of Berlin Wall
</H1>
The celebrations of the tenth anniversary of the fall of the
Berlin Wall began with a commemorative service. It was followed by a
ceremony in the Bundestag to commemorate the peaceful revolution in the
GDR (former East-Germany). President of Parliament Wolfgang Thierse,
former GDR people's rights activist, commended the courage and
intelligence of the people in the GDR during the turnaround period.
Former Chancellor Helmut Kohl, too, emphasized the role of the people
in the GDR in the peaceful revolution. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
reminded the audience that in all the jubilations about the fall of the
wall one must not forget the other special meaning of November 9. In
1937 it was the day of the Kristallnacht, the Night of Broken Glass
[when Nazi thugs launched the pogrom against the Jews]. Former Soviet
president Mikhail Gorbachev reminded that the unification of the German
people would need time, the division had not yet disappeared in all
heads. Tonight, an open-air festival will take place at the Brandenburg
Gate to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the opening of the Wall.
