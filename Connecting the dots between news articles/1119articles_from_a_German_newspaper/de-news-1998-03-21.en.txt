</H1>
The German physicians are fighting against the general authorization
of hospitals for out-patient treatment. The head of the Federal
organization of physicians Schorre explained in a magazine interview that
clinics are more expensive than general practitioners due to the clinics'
infrastructure. Since the need for in-patient treatment is decreasing,
hospitals are trying to build up their out-patient treatment and survive
at the cost of the patients. This would lead to higher insurance premiums.

The Ecological Democratic Party (OEDP) is planning to center its election
