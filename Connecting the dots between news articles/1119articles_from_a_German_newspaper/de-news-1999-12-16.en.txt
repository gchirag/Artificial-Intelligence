Committee investigating party donations begins work
</H1>
 The parliamentary committee investigating the party donation scandal
will begin work today to discover whether decisions by former chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government were for sale. The committee chairman, Volker
Neumann (SPD), expects that it will take until the end of February before
they have looked through all the documents and interviewed the first
witnesses. Neumann came out in favor of rescinding former Chancellor Kohl's
immunity should the public prosecutor's office in Bonn find probable cause
for suspicion in connection with slush fund accounts during his tenure as
head of the CDU. The task of the committee is to determine "to what extent
contributions were made to members of the former governing coalition, i.e.,
CDU, CSU and FDP, and did these influence political decisions, including the
sale of tanks to Saudi Arabia and the privatization of the East German oil
refinery Leuna?" According to statements by Neumann, the committee will also
investigate the two new accusations made against the CDU/CSU.

</H1>
The Bundestag voted today on the results of the mediation committee's
deliberations. The committee decided yesterday evening to cut the budget by
only 27.5 billion DM instead of the 30 billion DM originally proposed.
Finance Minister Hans Eichel was able to push through most of his savings
package. The Bundestag passed the compromise made in the mediation committee.
Life insurance benefits will continue to be tax-exempt; in two weeks the
child benefit will increase to 270 DM or, alternately, the child tax
allowance will increase to 10,000 DM. The housing benefit for low-income
households will increase in 2001 an average of 83 DM and more people will
qualify. On the other hand, the homeowner's bonus will be eliminated for
homeowners with high incomes. Increases in civil servant salaries, however,
remain open. With the watered-down health care reform, the budgets of the
individual sectors have been maintained, some were even increased. However,
certain operations can now only be performed on an out-patient basis.
