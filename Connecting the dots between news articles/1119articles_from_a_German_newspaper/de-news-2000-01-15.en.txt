Hessian Minister President Koch is not considering resigning
</H1>
Hessian Minister President and regional head of the CDU Roland Koch is not
considering resigning despite his party's donation scandal. Koch stressed
in a interview with the ZDF [German public television station] that he is
not responsible for the problems in the past and therefore intends to
complete the full four years for which the voters elected him. The
opposition parties in the Wiesbaden regional parliament demanded that the
politician step aside to ensure new elections take place. The SPD and
Greens feel that the Bundestag's [lower house of German parliament] factfinding committee should now audit the entire CDU party's management of
public finances. Both the former Hessian Minister President and the
present Federal Finance Minister, Hans Eichel, are demanding that the CDU
strive for a clean slate.

<P>
The former regional head of the CDU and Federal Minister of the Interior
Manfred Kanther admitted yesterday that the Hessian CDU had transferred
approximately eight million German Marks during the 1980s to an illicit
foreign bank account and then fetched back the money with an anonymous
inheritance as a cover. The sum total had risen over the years to 30
million German marks due to a favorable exchange rate. The Hessian CDU
treasurer back then, Prince zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, has taken full
responsibility for the transactions and admitted that he lied.

Ruehe stands for a complete investigation of the donation scandals
</H1>
Volker Ruehe, the CDU chairman and the leading candidate for the state
parliament elections in Schleswig-Holstein, has demanded a complete
investigation of the CDU donation scandals. Ruehe said that the party owed
the people as much during an CDU election campaign appearance in
Pinneberg, a town near Hamburg. He feels that a weak CDU would damage the
political balance in Germany. CDU Secretary General Angela Merkel called
on the party to unite because the party should show the voters what it can
do even in times of trouble. According to Merkel, there is no other
alternative but to aid the investigations of the finance scandal. She
feels that the actions of the CDU in Hesse (disclosing the existence of
secret foreign bank accounts) were right on the mark. After all, the CDU
has always stood for law and order as well as domestic security.

CDU donations scandal damages the democratic process
</H1>
According to politicians and scientists, the CDU donations scandal has
damaged the democratic process in Germany. Professor Hans-Peter Schneider,
a professor of constitional law told the dpa [a German news agency similar
to Reuters] that he feels the scandal is much more serious than the Flick
scandal and will have a devasting effect on politics in the eyes of the
public. Schneider said that in the Flick scandal financial donators
manipulated the laws and used certain tax advantages unlawfully; however,
this time the political parties are directly involved. A former judge on
the Federal Constitutional Court, Paul Kirchhof, also feels that these
activities have seriously endangered democracy. He is one of the CDU's
crisis consultants.

Party executives from the SPD and Greens hold conference
</H1>
The SPD and Greens have agreed on their agenda for the next few months
during the first joint conference of their party executives today in Bonn.
Both parties stressed their unity regarding central reform projects after
the conference. However, they could not come to an agreement regarding the
future retirement formula.

<P>
Green party leader Kerstin Mueller said that they need an element in the
formula that considers the increasing average life expectancy of the
population. The SPD does not feel this is necessary. According to SPD
party leader, Dr. Peter Struck, the coalition does, however, agree that
retirement contributions should be lowered. Some of the other topics that
were discussed including abandoning nuclear power and tax policies.

<P>
The SPD and Greens could not agree on a deadline for halting the operation
of nuclear power plants. Representatives of both parties could only agree
on continuing talks with the energy industry. A political decision should
be made by the end of February. According to party spokeswoman Mueller,
this way the Green party will be certain by the beginning of their party
conference in March whether the abandonment of nuclear power will be
undertaken with or against the will of the industry.

Young Socialists reproach Chancellor Schroeder
</H1>
The Young Socialists are accusing Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of breaking
his election promise regarding study grants. Schroder vetoed Federal
Minister of Education Edelgard Bulmahn's plan for BafoeG [federal
education/training assistance]. Under this plan, students would receive a
basic grant of 400 German marks a month, independent of how much their
parents earn.

Pharmaceuticals budget
</H1>
CDU and FDP politicians are calling for more freedom for physicians when
prescribing pharmaceuticals. They told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag"
that in light of the imminent wave of influenza, Federal Minister of
Health Andrea Fischer should either temporarily suspend or at least
increase the budget. Otherwise patients could be denied prescriptions for
necessary but expensive medications.

The student from Schwaebisch Hall who was suffering from Lassa fever has
died. According to the hospital (Missionsaerztliche Klinik) in Wuerzburg
treating her, the patient's organs stopped functioning this morning. The
23-year-old was probably suffering from a new, extremely aggressive form

pathogene she had contracted. No other new cases of Lassa fever have been
reported in Germany.
