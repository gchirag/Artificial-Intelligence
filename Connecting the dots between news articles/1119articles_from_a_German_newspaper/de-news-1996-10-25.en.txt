Bavaria's metal-workers' union cancels award
</H1>
The dispute about fully paid sick-leave is being regionalised once again.
The Bavarian metal-workers' union (IG Metall) were the first to give notice.
Mr Neugebauer, head of the Bavarian chapter of the union, said: "Today the
awards commission decided, after a lengthy discussion here in Regensburg,
to give notice as far as some clauses for workers and employees were
concerned, as of 31 January 1997. We want a settlement that's water-tight,
so not even underemployed backroom-lawyers will have something to argue
about. We have to give longer notice in other states, so we may be setting
a trend in Bavaria, and, if required, use industrial action to guarantee
fully paid sick-leave."

Early awards talks in chemical industry
</H1>
A day after mass-demonstrations in the metal-industry, employers and unions
in the chemical industry agreed to solve the dispute about fully paid
sick-leave by starting negotiations as early as in November - though the
awards will not run out until the end of 1997.

<P>
Today they only agreed on one item: they will meet again on 19 November, in
Wiesbaden, and combine the issue of paid-sick leave with talks on more pay.
Until then, it is up to the employers how much they are going to pay for
sick-leave (provided it is not less than 80%). Big companies such as Hoechst,
BASF and Bayer kept paying 100%, in order to avoid social conflicts - though
they did not have to do so (was not part of *their* awards).

Decision on minimum wages for construction workers postponed once again
</H1>
And the ministry's awards commission wants to wait for another meeting
between employers and unions. Labour Minister Norbert Bluem now wants to
put his oar in. The sticking-point is, as in the past, the employers'
demand to limit minimum wages until the end of May 1997, thus keeping the
option of lowering them once more in spring. The unions do not agree to this
time-table, and claim that the time-frame is far too short for an assessment
if minimum-wages would work. Now Mr Bluem wants to enter the ring, to
negotiate, though he does not want government arbitration. "We have to make
good use of any chance or occasion for an agreement that's acceptable to
both sides. We have to get away from confrontation, these days we're beyond
that. We just have to come to an agreement on this issue."

<P>
Employers and unions consider this renewed stalemate as a step back, and
mainly middle-sized companies are worrying about survival, plus each day
without a minimum-wage agreement also means job losses for German
construction workers. The new time-table stipulates that a solution
should be found until November 1996. Till then the law on secondment will
have no teeth, a law parliament passed to protect the construction industry
against wage-dumping from South European construction workers.

Subsidies for coal-industry to be reduced
</H1>
And they are to be a lot lower than the the 7 billion mark threshold the
unions asked for, according to the chancellor, but there are no numbers so
far. They only agreed that they disagreed. The unions would not object to
lowering subsidies from currently 10 billion marks to 7 billion marks, until
the year 2005, but Chancellor Kohl said that subsidies had to be much lower.
All agreed to keep negotiating, and next month there will be talks between
employers, unions and state representatives of North/Rhine-Westphalia and
the Saarland.

Education ministers on spelling reform and university entrance exam
</H1>
In Dresden the state ministers for education tackled real education problems:
the new German university entrance exam (Abitur), and the controversy about
reforming German spelling, and they were able to reach an agreement on both
issues. Early in the afternoon, they released a communique as far as the
spelling reform was concerned.

<P>
The reform will go ahead, and the declaration refuted authors' and
publishers' claims as unfounded and wrong. The latter had simply missed the
boat, joining the discussion far too late in the play. They also pointed out,
that Goethe's and Schiller's works would not have to be reprinted because
they were following the now obsolete rules on spelling.

<P>
As far as University Entrance (Abitur) is concerned, they stuck to the rule
that the exam should normally be taken after 13 years of schooling.
The exception to the rule: it may be taken after 12 years, provided the
accrued total of so-called total lecture-hours/week reaches 265. This number
might sound a bit strange to students and teachers alike. It does not mean
that only 265 hours of school is enough to sit the exam, but rather that
265 divided by 9 years equals 29.5 lecture-hours/week. In case someone
wanted to fast-track it and sit the exam a year earlier, they would have to
do 33 hours per week (instead of 29.5). Only Saxony and Thuringia had stated
that they wished to stick to 8 years' secondary schooling. That would require
a more tightly packed time-table, and even classes in the afternoon. This,
however, would apply only from 1 August 1997, to pupils entering secondary
school then.

More affirmative action against Scientology
</H1>
The state premiers want to take more affirmative action against the
Scientology organisation. At their meeting in Erfurt, they asked the state
ministers for internal affairs to check if conditions were met to warrant
a general observation all over Germany, by the Federal Intelligence Agency
(Bundesverfassungsschutz). The states, in turn, would try all legal avenues
to fight the organisation's quest for supremacy, according to the resolution
passed by the state premiers.

Lufthansa award settled
</H1>
The transport and services union and Lufthansa settled their
award, whereas the employees' union (DAG), representing cabin and cockpit
crew, walked out on the talks: they thought the employers' offer was
too low.

<P>
Some of the award's details: pay goes up by 1.7% from April 1998, and all
staff are to get a one-off payment of one third of their monthly wage.
Lufthansa also offers profit-share, back-dated to last year. Last year, the
company's profit was more than 700 million marks, before tax. Staff are also
to share future years' profit, provided there is one. A spokes-person for
the union said: "We don't want to make a song and dance about it, but we can
live with it." The award was settled within 6 days, and there had be no
industrial action. It is moot if the employees' union (DAG) will come to
the party.

Mr Kinkel back from Asia
</H1>
Ulan Bator. Foreign Minister Kinkel finished his 5-day tour of Asia,
covering China and Mongolia. Before flying out, he assured Mongolian
government officials of political and economic support as far as their
reforms were concerned. At the beginning of the week, Mr Kinkel and China's
representatives had agreed on expanding their relations. Irritation
between Bonn and Beijing, caused by the German parliament's resolution on
Tibet in June, now was a thing of the past, according to Mr Kinkel.

Chancellor Kohl to travel to Asia for a week

Last night Chancellor Kohl left for Asia to spend about a week in Indonesia,
the Philippines and Japan. Mr Kohl is accompanied by three ministers,
several members of parliament and 56 high-ranking managers. He mainly wants
to foster economic contacts in these three countries. Mr Kohl also wants to
talk about human rights when he meets Indonesia's premier Suharto in
Djakarta on Monday. There are no plans for him to meet up with
representatives of East Timor's independence movement, though members of
the German delegation wish to meet some dissidents.

Mr Stolpe files complaint against discontinuation of investigations
</H1>
Brandenburg's state premier Stolpe filed a complaint against the public
prosecutor's decision to discontinue investigating him and two former
security (Stasi) officers. Investigations are based on the question who
presented Mr Stolpe with the GDR's medal for merits in 1978. Mr Stolpe
gave assurances that Mr Seigewasser, the then undersecretary for church
matters, had done it, while former security officer Rossberger declared
under oath that he had been the one. The public prosecutor had discontinued
investigations due as it would be impossible to find out unequivocally
what had happened at the time.

The ACE automobile club has to stop offering discounts on new cars
to union members, for the time being. The Stuttgart Higher Regional Court
upheld an injunction obtained by the central association of German car
manufacturers and dealers. The Stuttgart Regional Court had previously ruled
that discounts of up to 15% for union members broke the law on discounts.
The main trial has not been set so far.
