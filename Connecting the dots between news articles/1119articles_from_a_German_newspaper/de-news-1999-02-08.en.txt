</H1>
After the Red/Green defaet in Hesse state elections, the SPD

Struck, on the other hand, said the plans would not be changed.

the electoral debacle and resigned collectively. State manager

Employers demand new government course after Hesse elections
</H1>
After the government changeover in Hesse, employers called on the
federal government to restructure their economic and financial
course from the ground up. Especially the tax laws would have to
be taken back, said employers'association chairman Hundt in Bonn.
The change in the Bundesrat voting division should give reasons
to the government to have a completely new think coming about tax
policies. Hundt also appealed to the chancellor's office to
discuss the future of wage policies. A basic consensus on the
matter must needs be reached in the course of the "alliance for
employment" talks, he said.

"Last mile" will cost Telekom competitors DM 25.40
</H1>
The regulatory office decided to authorize Telekom to charge its
competitors DM 25.40 a month for use of their user terminals. The
rent cost is seen as the decisive factor for competition in local
calls. Telekom had asked for a monthly rent of DM 37.30, while
competitors offered to pay something between DM 10 and DM 20. The
regulatory office announced that the new rates were effective
immediately and would run until March 31st, 2001. Deutsche
Telekom said they accepted the ruling. Mobilcom said they would
reduce their planned offering for local calls. The rent price now
established would limit competition to commercial clients.
Mannesmann Arcor, on the other hand, said they would go to court
against the decision and also file an appeal to the anti-trust
office.
