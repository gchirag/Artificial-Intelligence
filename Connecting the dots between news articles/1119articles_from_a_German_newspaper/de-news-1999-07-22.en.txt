Fischer: Positive Assessment of Trip to Turkey
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer gave his two-day visit to Turkey a
positive assessment. In his words, Berlin and Ankara had begun a new chapter
in their relations. They had many common interests, he said, as do Europe and
Turkey - it was harder and harder to keep them apart. He added that there was
a great deal of agreement and that the two countries had similar ways of
describing the problems. The federal government plans to help Turkey in its
efforts to be formally granted member candidate status at the EU summit in
Helsinki at the end of the year. Fischer also brought up Turkey's human
rights record in his discussions and pressed for a peaceful settlement to
their problem with the Kurds.
