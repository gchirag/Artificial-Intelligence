Simonis appeals to Green Party
</H1>
Schleswig-Holstein's State Premier, Mrs. Simonis, has called on Alliance
90 / The Greens not to jeopardize a possible change of government in
Bonn. Mrs. Simonis, a member of the executive board of the Social
Democratic Party (SPD), said on "Deutschlandfunk" radio that the Greens
have to stop emphasizing the contentious items in state coalitions
between the Greens and the SPD. Stressing issues like Gartzweiler II
instead of positive government work keeps voters from recognizing that
red-green is a viable alternative to the coalition now governing in
Bonn. Mrs. Simonis stressed that her party wants a change of government
to prove that a different employment policy is possible in spite of
empty coffers. She appealed to her party to overcome mental blocks and
develop new ideas, as the Netherlands have done, so that the long-term
unemployed will find work again.

violence and mobbing against fellow students. There has also been an
