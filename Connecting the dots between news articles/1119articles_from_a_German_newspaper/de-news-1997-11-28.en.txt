Parliament passes 1998 budget
</H1>
Parliament's governing coalition-parties passed the 1998 budget, as
well as the additional budget for 1997. During the final debate, there were
signs of a certain inclination to compromise, as far as the tax-reforms were
concerned. And that was also true for the Upper House (Bundesrat), as far as
the planned pension-reforms were concerned. The FDP will give up their
original plea for a net lowering of the tax-burden in the first instance, and
they also agreed to not ask for pension-reforms to be tackled as early as
next year. Head of the opposition SPD-party Oskar Lafontaine stated that
now there should not be any problem getting the legislation through both
Houses straight away - meaning sales tax would go up by 1% as of 1 April
1998. This would enable contributions to the compulsory pension-scheme to
stay at 20.3%. The SPD for their part gave up plans to raise 'petrol-tax'
and do away with reforms of the so-called 610-mark jobs (very popular, as
they are exempt from social-security contributions, and only the employer
pays 'a bit of' tax).

<P>
Mr Lafontaine, however, wants a compromise based on his party's plans. The
FDP in turn added a qualifier to their's: they will agree to
pension-reforms, provided the SPD will come to the party as far as
tax-reforms are concerned. Government and Mr Lafontaine had already been on
the phone about the matter, and they had agreed to keep the conversations
confidential, which would also go for a first round of talks following
the SPD Party Congress next week.

Federal states join ranks in looking for ways to save money
</H1>
In view of the dire straits public finances are in, the states want to have
another look at how money could be saved in their budgets. According to
Bavaria's Premier Stoiber, public servants would not be exempt from
scrutiny. All premiers agreed that a big reform of the tax-system would be
what they wanted. Baden-Wuerttemberg's premier Teufel saw some signs of
hope, looking at the narrowing of the rift between CDU and SPD, as well as
the FDP: "We, the state premiers, agree that it would be excellent if taxes
were reformed until the upcoming federal elections. And well done to all
concerned, who've started talking to each other once again."

Preliminary hold on payments for FDP-party
</H1>
For the time being, there will be no further public money for the FDP-party,
as Speaker Suessmuth (Bundestagspraesidentin) decided today to put a hold on
the instalment due on 1 December (2 million marks). She stated that this was
due to the matter being under investigation by the Cologne Administrative
Court. The judges intend to rule on 10 December if the FDP received
12.4 million marks in 1996 without being entitled to them - due to some
procedural errors.

Region around the river Oder to get five million marks
</H1>
The Brandenburg state government intends to spend more than five million
marks on boosting the region around the river Oder, which had been badly hit
by last summer's floods. Until 2010 some 770 million marks will be spent on
flood-protection measures, according to State Premier Stolpe. The biggest
chunk would be spent on repairing and upgrading roads. Apart from that,
money would also be spent on getting towns and villages up to scratch, plus
economic development of the area.

German electricity producers are to lose their territorial
supply-monopolies, according to a law passed by parliament today. This would
open up energy markets to European competition.

Baden-Wuerttemberg teachers' working-hours to be reformed
</H1>
The Baden-Wuerttemberg government wants to reorganise the hours
worked by their teachers. This would fill gaps caused by lack of teachers,
according to Education Minister Schavan. Teachers are to work another hour
per week for the next five years: in return, they will work one hour less
per week as of 2008. This would be compulsory for all teachers aged between
30 and 49 years - except for secondary school teachers.

Mr Wienand's appeal shot down
</H1>
The German Federal Court of Justice did not allow an appeal
against the sentence of former SPD top-politician Wienand. Mr Wienand now
will have to serve 2 1/2 years in prison, and pay back a million marks in
fees he received as an agent. Between 1976 and 1989, Mr Wienand had passed
on internals and personal observations to his contact-person in the then East
German Secret Service. He would have received close to 1.3 million marks for
his services, which the court thought most certainly were not mitigating
circumstances. Mr Wienand had complained that two eventual witnesses for the
defence had not been heard, but that argument was shot down by the court:
the two witnesses had been members of the GDR Secret Service staff, and
therefore unfit as witnesses for the defence. As Mr Markus Wolf, former head
of the GDR Secret Service, had already stated that he would not testify in
case he was asked to be a witness for the defence (which he was entitled to),
the court did not consider him either.

Murderer of Kim Kerkow on trial
</H1>
Defence counsel joined ranks with the public prosecutor, asking
for a life-sentence for the murderer of 10-year old Kim Kerkow. The accused,
Rolf Diesterweg, had the last word: "I'm a man who has become guilty, I've
done something bad. I expect to get life, and I deserve it." The worst, in
his opinion, would be if he did not get treatment. As Mr Diesterweg had
made a full confession, defence counsel did not plead against life. It would
make sense to start treating him straight away, and it would not matter if
this took place in jail or in a psychiatric care hospital.
