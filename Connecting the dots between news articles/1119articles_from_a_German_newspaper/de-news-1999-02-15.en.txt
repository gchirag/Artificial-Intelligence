Parties blame each other for Tragedy of Guben
</H1>
The parliamentary party leader of the PDS, Gysi, holds the CDU and CSU
somehow responsible for the death of the Algerian in Guben/Brandenburg.
According to him, from the signature campaign against the double
citizenship the people only learn that they sign against foreign fellow
citizens. Gysi wants the CDU/CSU parliamentary party leader, Schaeuble,
to stop the campaign. After the tragedy of Guben, the political parties
mainly blame each other instead of being sorry about what happened.
According to the regional CDU-chairman, Schoenbohm, the Government of
Brandenburg welcomes the positive development of right-radical parties,
because so they can take some percent points from the CDU. The SPD of
Brandenburg characterized Schoenbohm's statement as a depressing
violation of the political style. In the night from Saturday to Sunday,
a 28-year-old Algerian died of loss of blood after crashing in a window
pane. He was running away from 15 skinheads. 8 of the supposed pursuers
had been arrested until now.
