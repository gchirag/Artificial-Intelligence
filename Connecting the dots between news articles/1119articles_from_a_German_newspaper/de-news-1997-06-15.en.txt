Preliminary meeting to the EU summit in Amsterdam
</H1>
EU finance ministers met the evening before the EU summit in order to try
and find a solution to disputes in the Stability Pact. The new French
Minister of Finance, Dominique Strauss Kahn, said last week in Luxembourg
that France would not sign the Stability Pact if no measures were taken to
combat unemployment. There has been much negotiation in the background in
this regard since. The Stability Pact is an addendum to the Maastricht
criteria, the aim of which is to commit member countries to a solid,
durable financial policy. The pact also aims at convincing member citizens
and economies that the Euro will be a stable currency. Should the finance
ministers not be able to reach a compromise by tomorrow [Monday], both the
currency reform as well as the summit itself will be endangered. The Euro
was not originally scheduled as an item for discussion at the summit. Great
Britain and France, however, now do not want to talk about currency reform,
but rather about the fight against unemployment.  The summit, which was
actually supposed to be concerned with reforms, has now been overshadowed
by the Euro and unemployment issues.

Kohl does not expect decrease in unemployment figures
</H1>
Bad Woerishofen.  Chancellor Helmut Kohl does not expect employment figures
to decrease either this year or the next, despite an improving economy.
During the festivities for the 100 year anniversary of the death of
Minister Kneipp, Chancellor Kohl said that the German economy stands a good
chance of improving, however that an improved gross national product does
not necessarily mean an increase in available jobs. Earlier, Chancellor
Kohl and Finance Minister Theo Waigel were booed by about 3,000 farmers who
accused them of failed agriculture politics.
