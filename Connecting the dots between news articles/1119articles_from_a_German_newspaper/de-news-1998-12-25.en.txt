In his traditional Christmas address, John Paul II called for the
protection of life, for peace in the world, and for the end of violence. He
was praying that the awareness will prevail all over the world to prohibit
the production and selling of weapons, to defend human life, and to abolish
the death penalty. Pope John Paul also included in his address those who
worked for the peace process in the Middle East. Thereafter, the head of
the Roman-Catholic Church gave the blessing "Urbi et Orbi" (to the City [of
Rome] and the World) from the balcony of the Cathedral of St. Peter. Then
the Pope read Christmas greetings in 58 languages in the presence of 40,000
people on St. Peter's Square.

the market economy. Referring to the next generations, Herzog said that a
society was in order only when one part did not live off the other part.
Those who have lots could share. Those who are strong could carry the weak.
