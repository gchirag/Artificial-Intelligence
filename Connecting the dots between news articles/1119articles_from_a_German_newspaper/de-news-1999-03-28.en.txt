German government is allegedly planning major tax reform
</H1>
According to the weekly paper "Bild am Sonntag", the German
government is allegedly planning a major tax reform bill. It is
speculated that this has been discussed in detail among the higher ranks
of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and will put into effect in the year
2000. Reforms include the family regulations which have been recently
stipulated by the German supreme court. According to the report, business
taxes will be reduced from around 50% to 35%, and the maximum tax rate
from 53% to 45 %. Government child support subsidies of 250 marks per
child since January 1 will probably be increased to 400 marks.
Apparently, the tax reform will be financed by increasing value added tax
(VAT) from 16% to 18%.

<P>
The government has denied the above report. A speaker for the Federal
Finance Ministry said that the figures in the report are pure speculation
and are without any factual basis whatsoever. It is generally known that
an commission of experts has been working on the reform since December
and that their report is due on April 30. Legislative procedures are due
to be initiated before the summer break. He said that until then,
however, any figures are speculative.

Trittin demands binding minimal standards for environmental protection
</H1>
According to Juergen Trittin, Minister of the Environment,
those practicing inferior environmental protection should not have an
advantage in the global economy. During a meeting with his colleagues of
the G8 nations, Mr. Trittin said that industrialized nations therefore
have to agree on binding minimal standards for environmental protection.
That means, among other things, taxing airplane fuel for international
travel and a commitment to protect biodiversity.

Another problem in trash burning facility
</H1>
There were renewed problems at the trash burning facility in
the Upper Palatinate town of Schwandorf on Friday night. Only today
[Sunday]  was it made known that unfiltered exhaust had escaped through
the smokestack for a period of sixteen minutes, the gases thus being
allowed to spread over the suburb of Dachelhofen. As a result, the
environmental protection agency has warned against eating homegrown
vegetables or fruit. The second oven at the power plant was shut down
immediately. Only two weeks ago, unfiltered exhaust also escaped from the
power plant and significantly raised dioxin values in the surrounding
area.

Rail travel to become more expensive
</H1>
Rail travel will become more expensive on April 1 with prices
increasing by 1.5% in West Germany. Long distance travelers in East
Germany will have to pay 5.2% more, whereas regional travel will be
increased by 3.7%. The result of this increase is that rail travel will
cost the same in both halves of Germany since the nine years of
reunification. The cost of the "Bahncard" (card allowing discounted rail
travel) and reserving seats will also cost more starting next Thursday.
According to a German Rail spokesman however, passengers will not face
additional price increases, this year at least, as a result of
environmental taxes being increased by 1,5% .
