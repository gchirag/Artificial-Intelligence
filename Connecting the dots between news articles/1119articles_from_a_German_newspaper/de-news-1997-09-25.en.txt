Italy intent on preventing German membership of Security Council
</H1>

Security Council, thereby preventing German membership of this UN body.
This proposal, however, has left Italian Foreign Minister Dini isolated
even within EU ranks. France is supportive of Germany's wish to be accepted
into this group of major powers as a permanent member. The People's

having thwarted too many attempts to find possible solutions. The Federal
Minister of Employment, Mr.Norbert Bluem, however continued to voiced muted

Progress during arbitration talks on part-time employment of mature age workers
</H1>
Arbitration talks on part-time employment of mature age workers have made
headway. Employers and the union for metal, engineering and electronics
have moved closer on several key questions. According to the arbitrator,
Mr.Dieter Spoeri, the financial aspect of part-time employment of older
workers was one of the issues where progress had been achieved. The most
contentious point, however, remains unresolved, namely the provisons'
binding character on all employers. The union strives for a system of
part-time employment for older workers that is compulsory for all
businesses.
For employees aged 55 and over, and working only half the normal weekly
hours, the proposed legislation stipulates an income of 70%, based on the
employee's last net income. The union demands 85%. It also wants to avoid
any reductions in pension payments.

planned tax reform. Mr.Hundt did not quote any figures regarding any
possible increase in job vacancies. The President of the Federal Labour
Office, Jagoda, had previously indicated that he expected any economic
recovery only to occur next year.

Beef scandal closes down Nordland
</H1>
The Nordland company in Kaltenkirchen will be shut down because of its
possible involvement in illegal trading in British beef. A spokesperson for
the Environment Department of the State of Schleswig-Holstein said in Kiel
that the company's permit to operate would be revoked for reasons of
concern for public safety. Beef, possibly from the United Kingdom, had been
processed at the company's premises in August. The European Commission had
subsequently demanded the company's closure. Member of the standing
committee on agriculture and rural development in the European Parliament,
Graefe zu Baringdorf, accused the Federal Government of a too hesitant
approach to the issue. Bonn, as the level of government responsible in this
case, had failed to alert veterinary agencies to the problem. The Federal
Health Minister, Mr.Horst Seehofer, had previously shifted responsibility
to the states.
