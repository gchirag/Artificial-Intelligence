Rise in Value Added Tax and other financial changes enacted
</H1>
The rise in Value Added Tax (VAT) came into effect today, along with a
range of other financial changes which will affect the consumer. The
rate of VAT rose from 15% to 16%, but there was no change to the lower
rate, which is paid on basic necessities such as food and rent. The
money raised by this measure is to be used to stabilise the rate of
state pension contributions. The price of rail tickets was also
increased today by an average of 1.84%. The supplement payable on
Inter-City and Euro-City trains was increased from DM 6 to DM 7.
Alongside this, a new 'old car regulation' came into effect today.
This means that anyone who de-registers an old car will need to
provide proof of use. A concurrent change to inheritance law means
that those children who were born outside of marriage after 1st June
1949 have exactly the same rights as those born to parents who were
married.

Jagoda: no improvement in the labour market
</H1>
Bernhard Jagoda (sp?), the President of the Federal Labour Office, has
commented that he does not think it likely that there will be an
imminent improvement in the labour market. He said that he thinks that
the labour market is not so much at the start of an upturn, but rather
is at the end of a downturn. Jagoda also made it clear that he
disagrees with the idea that unemployment can only be reduced through
economic growth. The Federal Association of Public Banks also reckons
that there will be no substantial improvement in the labour market
this year. The Association has predicted for 1998 that there will be
an average of 4.4 million unemployed; this is a similar figure to that
for 1997.

No agreement reached on 'alliance for more apprenticeships'
</H1>
The attempts to organise an 'alliance for more apprenticeships' have
failed. No agreement was reached during a meeting between Juergen
Ruettgers, the Federal Minister for Education and Training (CDU), and
the employers' and workers' representatives. Goerner, a member of the
executive committee of the German Trade Union Federation, criticised
the fact that the Federal Government is not prepared to make any clear
commitments on the issue. She continued, saying that all attempts
would fail unless those firms which do not take on and train young
people are forced to make a financial contribution. She pointed out
that an additional 70,000 training places will be needed in the
Autumn. Schleyer, the General Secretary of the German Trades'
Organisation said that he is confident that everyone who wants to
start in a trade in the Autumn will be offered a training place.

Mutual recriminations in Bundestag over tax reform
</H1>
In the debate surrounding proposals to reform the system of taxation,
the Government and Opposition have again accused each other of
blocking reform. In a debate in the Bundestag, Theo Waigel, the
Federal Finance Minister, accused the SPD of being split on the issue
of tax and of having no serious proposal in this regard. Dorothee
Solms, the leader of the parliamentary party of the FDP, said that the
SPD was split into two camps on the question of the highest rate of
tax. In reply to this, the SPD finance spokesperson Matthaeus-Maier
said that the SPD are holding to their election-program, which
proposes a cut in the highest rate of tax to 49%; other tax cuts would
only be possible if it was clear how to finance them.
