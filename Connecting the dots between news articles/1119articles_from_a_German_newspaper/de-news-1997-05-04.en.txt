Criticism of dispute between the parties on tax reform
</H1>
 The chairman of the union for the chemical industry
(IG Chemie), Mr. Schmoldt, has appealed to the government and the
opposition social democratic party (SPD) to negotiate again on the tax
reform question. The union head said that the Bundesrat (upper house of
parliament) does not seem to be in the position of being able compensate
for the failure of negotiations between government and opposition, thus the
parties themselves should thus see themselves morally obliged to try again.
The Federation of German Banks has also criticised the tax reform dispute.
Mr. Kohlhausen, the president of the Federation, said to the ARD television
station that both the issues of simplifying the current tax system (which
is urgently needed) and the dismantling of excess bureaucracy seem to have
been postponed to a time in the distant future.

Bluem sees opportunities for agreement in pension reform
</H1>
 Norbert Bluem, the Federal Minister of Employment, anticipates
opportunities for agreement with the SPD concerning tax reforms. He said
that both the coalition government and the opposition want to reform the
existing system. The SPD has been asked to present their suggestions for
restructuring the financing of the pension system as soon as possible. Mr.
Bluem has also urged employers to take advantage of the new employment
promotion law. The law which has been in effect since April enables, among
other things, the subsidising of wage costs and the assumption of risk for
continued wage payments during the first six months. Mr. Bluem said that it
is now the responsibility of employers to come up with intelligent reforms
for working hours.

Confrontation with Iran to be avoided
</H1>
Despite the fact that the German ambassador has not been allowed to
re-enter Iran, the German government wants to avoid a policy of
confrontation with Iran. Mr. Heuer, the Minister of State in the Foreign
Ministry, said to the Deutschlandfunk radio station that the development in
Iran's domestic politics must be observed calmly. Mr. Heuer also said that
it was a good sign that Iran was not able to come between the countries of
the European Union. The FDP politician urged continued level-headed
reactions from the EU. One could consider economic sanctions, he said, but
one cannot let this issue divide.

Coalition persists in reducing solidarity surcharge
</H1>
According to the CDU Secretary General, Mr. Hintze, the governing coalition
is holding to its planned decrease of 2 percent in the solidarity surcharge
from January 1 next year.  Financial solidarity with the new states is not
dependent on the size of the surcharge, Mr. Hintze claimed.  The General
Secretary for the FDP, Mr. Westerwelle, had already stated that this
resolution would not be changed. Several East German politicians spoke out
over the weekend against the surcharge decrease to 5.5 percent.

Scharping would like to continue tax reform negotiations
</H1>
 The parliamentary head of the SPD, Rudolf Scharping, has stated that
he is willing to continue negotiations with the governing coalition, even
thought the last round of negotiations had failed. Mr. Scharping said in an
interview with the "Bild-Zeitung" newspaper, that he would like positive
results in the dispute over tax reforms, if possible by means of a
mediation committee. Mr. Scharping's comment on Chancellor Kohl's offer to
reopen discussions was "hopefully he is serious about it this time, because
Mr. Kohl was responsible for letting the tax reform talks fail last time".
Mr. Scharping emphasised that the SPD would agree to lowering the top tax
rate if this is financed by the closing of tax loopholes. According to
Scharping, the SPD's tax reform policy is that a family of average income
with two children should pay DM 2000 less in annual taxes after the reform.

DGB: withdrawal of responsibility for legal protection
</H1>
 According to a report in the "Bild am Sonntag" newspaper,
several of the individual unions of the German Federation of Trade Unions
(DGB) have called for the DGB responsibility for legal representation of
members to be withdrawn. Some of the individual unions are apparently
dissatisfied with the quality of legal advice offered by the DGB. One of
these Union leaders said to the newspaper that DGB lawyers had often only
undertaken the preliminary legal qualification and were thus not qualified
to represent members in court. The DGB fears that up to a 1 000 jobs could
be lost should the DGB lose the responsibility for legally representing
members. At present, about half of DGB employees are employed in the legal
department.
