Fire brigade kept busy by storms
</H1>
Heavy storms and torrential rain have kept the inhabitants of
Northern Germany and Bavaria on edge all night. The fire brigade was
called out in numerous places to pump out flooded cellars, clear
flooded roads, help move fallen trees and to shore up roofs against
the rain. Hamburg was the worst hit area; 53 litres of rain fell per
square metre in just 14 hours.

Capital investors to sue government?
</H1>
Defrauded capital investors are threatening to sue the federal
government for millions of Marks because it has enacted an EU
directive on the security of investment too late. The European Union
announced the 'share service performance directive' back in 1993,
which was intended to protect investors from unscrupulous
profiteering. According to the directive, companies which deal in
stocks and shares must be officially registered and regularly
inspected. The directive is only to be enacted in Germany next year,
however, and the EU commission is planning to sue the government for
the delay. Klaus-Dieter Benner, the state commissioner of the Hesse
stock exchange supervisory committee, also believes that individual
investors might now sue the government if they have been defrauded in
this way.

CDU/CSU repudiate 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' report on cabinet changes
</H1>
Leading members of the CDU and CSU have derided a report in the
'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' newspaper about a forthcoming change in the
federal cabinet as a fabrication. The newspaper wrote that Theo
Waigel, the leader of the CSU, used an interview he gave in the middle
of the summer to stop Lueck, a CSU politician, from being named as the
new Minister for Agriculture. The General Secretaries of the CDU and
the CSU, Prozner (sp?) and Hintze, have issued a statement, calling
this "rubbish, tittle-tattle and completely made up." The newspaper's
report went further, saying that Waigel has been heavily criticised by
the CSU party executive, as his interview had made the cabinet change
impossible; his public musings had destroyed the element of surprise
in the change. The 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' cited unnamed CSU
politicians as saying that Waigel has damaged both himself and the
party greatly. The newspaper's report also claims that Seehofer, the
Minister for Health, is standing ready for a change in position -
either to the Ministry of Finance or the leadership of the CSU.

Kohl 'has no plans for cabinet change'
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has again denied that he is planning any
change in the cabinet. In a statement given in Berlin, Kohl said that
he has talked with Finance Minister Waigel about the issue, and that
his position has not changed, but remains as it was in his statement
given on Monday. He said further that no-one is considering the issue
any more in the CDU and called on people to stop making unsolicited
suggestions for changes to the cabinet and to concentrate on the
business of government. Within government circles it has been no
secret that Kohl has had a private discussion with Waigel on the
issue, but it was agreed that the substance of their discussion should
not be made public; this was the first meeting between the two since
Kohl's holiday. Kohl also announced today that there would be further
discussions with the SPD on the question of the tax reform.

Beckstein launches attack on Waigel
</H1>
Beckstein, the Minister of the Interior for the State of
Bavaria, has criticised Theo Waigel's behaviour as regards the
possible cabinet reshuffle; he is the first leading member of the CSU
to do so. He said that it is now high time to get back to real
politics. Unlike other high-ranking members of the CSU, Beckstein did
not deny the report in the 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' newspaper, which
claimed that Waigel ruined a planned change in the cabinet with his
hasty remarks.

The Greens have declared that they want the SPD to make Gerhard

a newspaper interview that he wants the SPD to choose Schroeder, the
Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, as their candidate for Chancellor for
this reason, but also because he believes that Schroeder would be
easier to work with in an SPD/Green coalition.

Bavarian state parliament to be reduced in size
</H1>
Beckstein, the Minister of the Interior for the State of
Bavaria, has suggested that the number of deputies in the Bavarian
state parliament should be reduced by around 12 per cent; this would
mean that only 180 members would sit in the parliament, rather than
the current 204. Beckstein believes that this will be possible without
a formal change to the constitution. The OeDP (a small ecological
political party) originally suggested that the parliament should be
reduced by 25 per cent in size, and is planning to push this through
by organising a referendum.

Referendum on spelling reform likely in Schleswig-Holstein
</H1>
The Schleswig-Holstein state parliament has cleared the way for
a referendum to be held on the current spelling reform, declaring that
an application by a citizens' movement on this issue is permissible.
If five per cent of those registered to vote in Schleswig-Holstein
sign the application, then a referendum must be held on the question.
The movement hope to change the Schleswig-Holstein school law, so that
the old spelling rules must be taught once again. A lawyer from
Luebeck, Thomas Elsner (sp?), said that this is an encouraging
decision for those who oppose the reform, and that he is sure that the
necessary 106,000 signatures will be collected. The organisers of the
opposition to the reform have six months' time to collect the
signatures; if enough are collected, then the law requires that a
referendum be held on the issue within nine months. They are hoping to
achieve success before this, though, as the Federal Constitutional
Court intends to reach a decision on the suit brought by Thomas Elsner
against the reform as soon as possible.

More British cattle products exported than previously thought?

More meat may have been illegally imported into Germany than

discounting the possibility that, as well as the firm in Augsburg
which is already known to have used British cattle products to make
sausage, two further firms, in Kulmbach and Coburg, may have done the
same.

Church recognises controversial youth movement
</H1>
The diocese of Augsburg has recognised 'Youth 2000' as an
official church youth movement. The group had previously been at the
controversial Marienfried place of prayer. In explanation, the diocese
has said that the group recognises and accepts the guidelines of the
episcopal conference. In 1993, the Bishop of Augsburg replaced the
leadership at Marienfried after it had made national headlines due to
its fundamentalist activities and the influence exerted there by the
'Angel-Work' group.

Health Ministry bans prescription-free HIV test
</H1>
The federal Health Ministry has announced that the home
testing kit for HIV, produced by the Canadian manufacturer Pace, is to
remain unauthorised for use in Germany. The company had claimed that
the controversial tests would be available without prescription in
pharmacies by September. The German distributor Nohif (sp?) has not
applied for authorisation and so the home testing kit can not yet be
sold in Germany. In the test, one drop of blood is mixed with the test
serum and the result is available in two minutes, telling the testee
whether they are HIV positive or not. The kit is more than 99 per cent
accurate, according to a biochemist at the University of Homburg. The
Canadian producer of the kit was under the impression that it did not
need special authorisation, as it does not use synthetic antibodies,
not natural ones. The Health Ministry agrees that there could be
methods of testing which do not need authorisation, possibly because
of a simple loophole in the law, but said that this was not the case
for this product.

'Labelle' attacker to be extradited to Germany
</H1>
The suspect in the 'Labelle' (sp?) attack case, who was arrested
in Italy, is to face trial in Germany. In the attack on the Berlin
discotheue eleven years ago, three people died and more than 200 were
injured. The Italian police picked up the trail of the Libyan suspect,
who has clearly been in Rome for at least a week, thanks to a series
of telephone calls made to Germany from a flat and from several
telephone boxes and to information from the German criminal police.
The suspect, forty year old Musbar Abal Gazem Ettr (sp?), has
apparently already confessed to the crime. A married couple from Libya
and a thirty-four year old Italian woman who are accused of hiding
Musbar were arrested along with him.

German electronic entertainment industry still losing ground

German manufacturers of electronic entertainment goods are
complaining that their market is saturated. Their trade organisation
announced just before the opening of the radio exhibition in Berlin
that their turnover has decreased by around ten per cent to DM 7.5
billion during the period from January to June this year; this is a
continuation of the downward trend which has been current for the last
five years. They placed the blame for this on cheap foreign imports -
due to the increased pressure of competition, jobs have been cut by a
half in the industry since 1992.
