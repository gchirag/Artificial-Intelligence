Kosovo talks in Moscow to resume later
</H1>
Diplomatic attempts to solve the Kosovo crisis made no progress. Talks
between Russian mediator Tchernomyrdin, Finland's President Artisari and
US Deputy Foreign Minister Talbot finished without concrete results. The
talks are to resume next Wednesday. According to Mr Artisari the key to
solving the problems was in Belgrade. Endeavours would be bundled and they
would try and find convincing arguments to persuade Belgrade. Mr Talbot
called the talks serious and constructive. Victor Tchernomyrdin is expected
to travel to the Yugoslavian capital once again at the beginning of next
week.

Debate about NATO strategy
</H1>

had asked for an armistice in the Kosovo conflict. According to spokesperson
Erdmann, Mr Fischer's latest move did not mean an armistice by stealth.
Given repeated bomb damage to Western embassies by NATO air-raids,
Mr Fischer had asked for a discussion about NATO's targetting plans. When
meeting a Swiss colleague Mr Fischer had said: " We need to talk urgently".

Upper House (Bundesrat) discusses 630-marks jobs
</H1>
Today the Upper House (Bundesrat) discussed the contentious law on the
630-marks jobs (also called McJobs). North-Rhine/Westphalia Premier Clement
was for it. The SPD-politician said the law was necessary to fight a host of
jobs that were exempt from social security contributions. "This isn't, and
I want to say it again, about newspaper delivery people or people doing
work for sports clubs. That's items we've acknowledged, and they'll be
fixed. It's about the fact that up to 13% of jobs in our country are
630-marks jobs - without social security, up to 20% in retail and up to
80% in the office cleaning sector.
