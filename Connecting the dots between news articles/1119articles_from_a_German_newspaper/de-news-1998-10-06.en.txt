Under four million unemployed
</H1>
The number of registered unemployed has sunk to under 4 million for the
first time since about two years ago. The percentage decreased from 10.6
percent in August to 10.3 percent in September. Bernhard Jagoda, President
of the Federal Labour Office called the trend a sustained improvement on
the job market. The current government saw the numbers as a confirmation of
their policies. Future SPD Labour Minister Riester criticised the mass
unemployment as the worst relicts of the leaving government. In view of
increased employment initiatives in the East by the government just before
the elections, representatives of Buendnis90/Gruene called the figures pure
number juggling.
In Baden-Wuerttemberg the unemployment decreased from 6.9 to 6.7 compared
to the month before.
