Commemoration of the kristallnacht
</H1>
The chairman of the Jewish Community in Berlin, Jerzy Kanal, has called for
utmost attention concerning undemocratic tendencies. Even though right wing
violence has decreased, there is a potential for violence which can not be
overestimated. Furthermore, right wing forces are increasingly using
electronic media to spread their ideology, Karnal said today during a
memorial in Berlin for the 58th anniversary of the progrom night. Karnal
said in commemoration of the horrible past that the National Socialists'
atrocities should not be forgotten. He criticized the decision of the
Berlin Senate to postpone the expansion of the exhibition "Topography of
Terror" until the year 2000.
<P>
The Mayor of Berlin, Diepgen, called the atrocities against Jews on
November 9, 1938, betrayal of the citizens by the state. Never again should
it be allowed that intolerance and blindness turn into murder and
destruction. In the night between November 9 and 10, 1938, about 2000
synagogues in Germany were set on fire and businesses of Jewish citizens
looted.

Hildebrandt demands initiative against unemployment
</H1>
Brandenburg's Minister of Employment and Welfare Regine Hildebrandt has
demanded an initiative of all political forces to fight unemployment. Mrs.
Hildebrandt told "Inforadio" that it is important to get all sides
committed to eliminate the problem of unemployment. For that to happen,
everybody has to want to eliminate it, though. She added that the
Chancellor's initiative in the beginning of the year -- his "treaty for
work" -- was the right first step. Employers, unions and politicians have
to get together and consider how, in a time of structural change in the
economy, conditions could be created such that there really is work for
everybody. According to Mrs. Hildebrandt the most important question is how
the work can be distributed evenly.

Biedenkopf and Diepgen criticize the government's financial policy
</H1>
In connection with the planned European currency union, criticism of the
financial policy of the German government is increasing in East Germany.
Saxonia's State Premier Biedenkopf told the radio station "Deutschlandfunk"
today that he has the impression that Bonn has lost all sense of proportion
in the rush to fulfill the criteria of Maastricht. To cut short recovery
processes which were set up for the long-term, might become more expensive
than the short-term savings. At the same time he said he understands cuts
in the secondary labor market in East Germany -- one has to honor the
wishes of the old federal states as well.
<P>
Berlin Mayor Diepgen criticized the federal government for transferring
more and more financial responsibilities to the states and communities in
order to fulfill the criteria of the currency union.

Moellemann criticizes policy of coalition partner
</H1>
In Duesseldorf, the state convention of the Liberal Democratic Party has
begun. Most important subjects are the tax debate within the Bonn coalition
and the controversial brown coal opencast mine Garzweiler II. In his
opening statements, State Chairman Moellemann criticized the position of
the coalition partner in the debate about the solidarity surtax. It is
intolerable that the Union first makes a promise and then sneaks away,
Moellemann said. He pointed to the coalition paper in which both parties
agreed to cut the solidarity surtax by two percent in 1998. It is
impossible to work in an unreliable coalition.

Schaeuble wants to credit child rearing towards pension
</H1>
The Chairman of the Union parties in the Bundestag (lower house) Schaeuble
has proposed to credit raising children towards pensions. During an event
of the Lutheran Academy Tutzing Schaeuble said that there must be a
redistribution between contributors with and without children. Given the
changes in the age pyramid, the CDU politician pleaded for a new generation
treaty. Solidarity between old and young can not become a one-way-street,
Schaeuble said. Therefore the older generation has to expect that pensions
are only going to grow as much as the general income.

Rainer Brechtgen is far behind.

was around 55 percent. 39 candidates had been in the second round of the

time this week. The regulation will become law on January 1.
