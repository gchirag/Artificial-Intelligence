SPD financial experts endorse Eichel's course
</H1>
Finance Minister Hans Eichel can expect the support of the federal
and state SPD for his austerity package. Budget experts and finance
ministers of states with SPD governments discussed the package for two days
in Wismar. Afterwards, the head of the working group, Wagner, said the
participants had no fundamental criticism of the austerity package. The
state premiers of Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Reinhard
Hoeppner and Harald Ringstorff, announced that their states would vote for
the package in the Bundesrat. The consolidation of finances was necessary
for the federal government to be able to support the eastern states even
after the expiration of the solidarity pact in 2004. About 30 SPD left
wingers, however, demanded changes to the austerity package, especially a
taxation of large private assets.

Closed door meeting of Buendnis90/Gruene
</H1>
The members of the B90/G faction of the Bundestag have met in
Weimar for a two-day closed-door meeting. The faction wants to review its
performance since the change of government. Main topics will be the pension
and environmental policies and the pull out from nuclear energy. Federal
Environment Minister Juergen Trittin and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
also participate in the meeting.
In a working paper pension expert Goering-Eckart (sp?) demands that
pensio       ?d be increased in line with inflation even after 2001 and not
in relation with the average net income [as it is now, but according to
Eichel's plans, pensions will be tied to inflation rate until 2001]. The
target is to reduce the pension level to 65% of the income. Private old-age
insurance must be encouraged and supported by tax benefits. Faction leader
Kerstin Mueller said that limiting the increase of pensions to the rate of
inflation for the next two years was not sufficient. Before the meeting,
faction leaders Kerstin Mueller and Rezzo Schlauch had called on the
faction members to adopt the coalition's tax and austerity package without
reductions of the content. On Monday, the spokesperson for the executive
board of B90/G, Ms. Radke, had criticized coalition partner SPD because of
its internal quarrels about the austerity package. She was afraid that the
current performance of the SPD could hurt the Greens. Many in the East were
angry about the package.

Hearing of designated EU-budget commissioner Schreyer
</H1>
The designated budget comissioner Schreyer wants to intensify the
fight against fraud and mismanagement in the European Commission. The
former Greens senator for the environment said at the beginning of her
hearing for the Europarliamentary Committee, that it was the only way to
win back people's faith. The 48-year old promised to be sparing with EU
money and described the expansion of the EU as one of the most important
tasks for the coming five years. At the same time, Schreyer rejected
criticism from conservative delegates who claimed that she has too little
experience with working on an international level and with budgetary
policy. The week long hearing of the new comissioner for the Competency
Committee of the Europarliament began on Monday.  On Wednesday it will be
SPD politician Verheugen's turn. He is earmarked as commissioner for
eastern expansion.

DGB: pensions to be further linked to netto salaries
</H1>
According to the German federation of trade unions in
Baden-Wurttemberg, pensions must remain linked to the development of netto
salaries. In an interview with the German press, the DGB-chairman from
Baden-Wurttemberg Bliesener  rejected even an only temporary adjustment to
the rate of inflation. Bliesener said that if the Red-Green government does
not show itself to be open to discussion on this issue by the fall, it can
count on protests, especially in Baden-Wurttemberg.
