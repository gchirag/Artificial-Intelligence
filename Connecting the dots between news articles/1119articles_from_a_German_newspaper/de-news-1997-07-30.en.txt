Escaped sect members in Santiago de Chile
</H1>
Santiago de Chile. It is thought that the two members of the Colonia
Dignidad sect that fled the sect's settlement might know where the
sect's leader, Paul Schaefer, is hiding. The two men are at present at
the German deputy ambassador's private house, which the police have
surrounded with a large presence, probably in order to protect the
men. The two are Tobias Mueller, 24, and Salo Luna, 23, a native of
Chile. Mueller and Luna are to be taken to the town of Paral where
judge Ernand Gonzales (sp?) is leading the investigation into
Schaefer, the sect's leader, who has been accused of child abuse and
slave trading. Schaefer has been in hiding for the last year, although
judge Gonzales hopes that at least Mueller knows of Schaefer's
whereabouts, and will be prepared to tell the investigation where he
is. Mueller is not thought to belong to the inner circle of the sect's
colony.

Dikes at Hohenwutzen likely to break
</H1>
Frankfurt an der Oder. It is feared that dikes are about to break in
northern Oderbruch. One of the dikes there had fallen to 50 metres by
the afternoon and the authorities gave the alarm and began with the
evacuation of 10,000 people, saying that the situation was very
serious. Platzeck (sp?), the state minister for the Environment, said
that the situation at Hohenwutzen is the most dangerous that there has
yet been in the floods. He said that there is a hole beneath the dike
top which is 40 metres wide, 30 metres long and several metres deep.
General Hans-Peter Kirchbach, the director of the army's operations at
the dike has said that he believes that the dike can still be saved.
The crisis management team's evacuation operation has since spread out
to include central Oderbruch, where the inhabitants had already had
their cases packed for days when they heard agreed signal - church
bells and sirens.

FDP thinks spelling reform will fail
</H1>
The FDP thinks that the planned reform of German
spelling, which is already partly in progress, will not succeed. FDP
Members of the Bundestag are planning to propose a motion in the
autumn against the reform. Herman Otto Seums, the leader of the FDP
parliamentary party, said that he expects the Bundestag to decide in
favour of the motion and to call on the government to refuse to take
on the reform, and if this proves to be the case, then the whole thing
should be dropped as soon as possible. He also said that the federal
states' education ministers should not have tried to introduce the
reform yet.

Emergency application against spelling reform rejected
</H1>
The Administrative Court of the federal state of Thueringia in
Weimar has rejected an emergency application against the spelling
reform. The application was brought by a woman from Jena who wanted to
stop the Ministry of Education and Arts from teaching her son
according to the new spelling rules. The judges decided that the
parents right to educate their children had not been infringed by the
new spelling rules. The court said that the way in which certain words
were spelt does not interfere with an impartial teaching of subject
knowledge. Yesterday, the Wiesbaden Administrative Court put a
temporary stop to the reform, a move which attracted national
attention.

Baden-Wuerttemberg State Court of Auditors censure state government
</H1>
The Baden-Wuerttemberg State Court of Auditors has severely
criticised the state government, particularly its personnel and
budgetary policies. The Court said that the government has been saying
for years that it is planning to reduce personnel costs and cuts jobs,
but has done exactly the opposite. In  a ten year period, an
additional 7,500 posts have been created, so personnel numbers have,
in fact, risen. Now almost 41 per cent of the entire state budget is
accounted for by personnel costs. The government's budgetary policy
has hardly been better, according to the court; despite all efforts to
save money, the state's debts have constantly increased. Otto Guenther
Lohnhard (sp?) even thinks that the budgetary situation has become
dangerous. The state's debts rose by DM 3.2 million in total last
year; the year before that, the increase had only been DM 1.1 million.
The total debts of the state have now reached DM 53.4 million.
