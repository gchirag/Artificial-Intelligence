EU employment summit in Luxembourg
</H1>
A few hours before the EU summit talks on
employment were to begin, more than 20,000 persons from
almost all EU member nations joined in a demonstration
against unemployment. They had been called up by the
European federation of unions. The demonstrators called
on Chiefs of State and government heads to agree on
concrete steps towards job creation and security.
<P>
The Chiefs of State and government heads of the European
Union will assemble today and tomorrow to discuss ways
leading out of the prevailing situation of mass
unemployment. According to official reports, there are
over 18 million unemployed EU-wide.
<P>
The special meeting stems from an effort by France's
leftist government. Luxembourg's government head and
European Council president Juncker says this should not
be a "summit of literary academicians" leading to
uncompromising resolutions. Most EU governments agree.
<P>
Immediately before the special summit, European
socialist leaders had a meeting chaired by German SPD
parliamentary leader Rudolf Scharping to coordinate
their strategies. None of Europe's social democratic
governments is in favour of establishing employment
guidelines on paper, said Scharping, and the SPD agrees.
Just like the EU-Commission and the Luxembourg council
president, the social democrats want the summit
participants to agree on concrete aims.
<P>
The employment summit began belatedly due to fog and
icy rainfalls in France.
