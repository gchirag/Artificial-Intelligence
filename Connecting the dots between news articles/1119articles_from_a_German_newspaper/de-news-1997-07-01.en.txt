prosecutor Heinrich Wilde. He forced his hostage to get into the driver's
seat of the car that he had demanded for his flight. The man took the seat
behind his hostage. Shortly after the car had started moving a flash

Talks between Kohl and Stoiber about introduction of Euro
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl considers the continuing discussion about the
introduction of a common European currency hardly meaningful. Outside
Germany the debate was not being understood anyway, Kohl said at the
Bavarian Employers Congress. The Chancellor asserted that Germany will meet
the Maastricht deficit criteria to the point. Bavaria's State Premier
Edmund Stoiber was satisfied with Kohl's statement to meet the deficit
criterion of 3.0 percent. After their addresses both met for short four-eye
talks. No information was available on the subject.
Stoiber had caused tensions between Bonn and Munich by repeatedly demanding
to delay the introduction of the common currency Euro if there was an
emergency situation.
