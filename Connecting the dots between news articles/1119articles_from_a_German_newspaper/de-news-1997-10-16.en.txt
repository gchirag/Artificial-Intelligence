Kohl rules out an early handover to Schaeuble
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has announced that he'll stay in office for the next
four years. He himself has raised doubts about his willingness to stay in
office by naming Wolfgang Schaeuble as his successor without suggesting a
date for the handover. Mr Kohl told the ZDF [German television channel]
that there would be no premature change in the Chancellor's office. He
claimed that he has named Mr Schaueble as his successor after the
"overwhelming success" Mr Schaeuble has enjoyed during the Leipzig party
conference. But Mr Kohl denied that his remarks would bind the party in any
way. It was not up to him to assign party functions, as this had to be done
by the respective committees. But it was his personal wish that Mr
Schaeuble became his successor.
The CDU secretary-general Peter Hinze claimed that the nomination of
Wolfgang Schaeuble as Kohl's successor was a clear indication of the
political long-term planning of Chancellor Kohl, while the opposing
Social-Democrats and the Greens regarded the announcement as a symptom of
weakness. According to the SPD secretary-general Mr. Muentefering
chancellor Kohl knew that he was no longer able to lead the party and
therefore tried to hide behind Mr Schaeuble.

Yet another bankruptcy affects 2000 tourists
</H1>
For the third time within the last fortnight a German tour operator has
declared himself bankrupt. This time more than 2000 holiday-makers in
Turkey are affected. The German honorary consul in Antalya confirmed the
bankruptcy of the Berlin-based tour operator Scapel-Tours. Although the
associated airline GTI refuses to fly the 2200 holiday makers back from
Antalya, so far no tourists have contacted the honorary consul or the
German embassy in Antalya. Apparently most holiday-makers are not yet aware
of the bankruptcy of their tour operator. The insurance company which deals
which that sort of emergencies has asked the Hamburg-based tour operator
Oeger-Tours to organise the return flights for the coming weekend. Only 2
weeks ago Oeger-Tours had to fly 2700 German holiday-makers back from
Antalya. And in Crete another 300+ tourists have to wait for their return
flights after their Wuerzburg-based tour-operator declared himself bankrupt.

Diepgen opposes renegotiations of fiscal federalism
</H1>
The Berlin mayor, Eberhard Diepgen, has rejected any renegotiations of
fiscal federalism. He told the [daily] newspaper "Die Welt" that the
approach of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria misses the point of fiscal
federalism, which had to consider specific burdens and responsibilities of
the states. Large urban areas for example had to cope with especially high
welfare costs. The development of a German federal nation was only possible
because the donor states have financed fiscal federalism. During to
discussions today Hesse has also complained about the amounts it has to pay
into the system.

SPD/The Green Party: progress during coalition talks in Hamburg
</H1>
The Social Democrats and the Green Party have made some progress during
talks aimed at the formation of a coalition government. According to the
leader of the SPD delegation, Mr Runde, a compromise has been reached for
the controversial topic of refurbishment of the Hamburg airport. The
terminal would be adapted according to the increase in passenger numbers,
but simultaneously legal measures with the aim of noise reduction would be
implemented. The parliamentary party leader of the Green Party, Ms Sager,
declared that future noise reductions and a strict enforcement of the ban
on all night-time flight have been defined as a political long-term goal.
Additionally the public transport facilities should be enhanced. Both
parties also were in favour of increasing the areas in which a speed limit
of 30 km per hour was in place.

Schroeder against limitation of GDR-crimes at the end of 1997
</H1>
The Eastern German theologist and Social Democrat Mr Schroeder wants to
prevent limitation of fraudulent crime during the German unification.
During an interview with the Berlin-based newspaper "Tagesspiegel" Mr
Schroeder stressed that these crimes were committed due to sheer greed and
they still had to be prosecuted. But he denied being in favour of a general
extension of the current limitations for crimes committed in the former
GDR, as the limitation did not prevent any rehabilitation of the victims of
those crimes. So far the limitation has been postponed, because the
judicial system has not been fully established in Eastern Germany. From the
end of 1997 all crimes which are classified as non severe and carry
sentences of up to 5 years will fall under the statue of limitation.

Iran: German ambassador should return last to Teheran
</H1>
The Iranian government insists that the German ambassador can return to
Teheran only after all other EU-diplomats have come back. A spokesman of
the Iranian Foreign Ministry declared that this demand was clearly brought
forward during talks with EU-representatives. Apart from Greece all
EU-governments have recalled their ambassadors from Teheran after the
Berlin regional court had accused the former Iranian government of
masterminding the assassination of 4 opposition politicians.

Formula 1: Schumacher with narrow lead in Jerez
</H1>
Michael Schumacher starts the last race of this year's formula 1 world
championship with a one point lead after Williams has retracted a protest
against the disqualification of Jacques Villeneuve during the Japanese
Grand Prix. Apparently the retraction should avoid an even worse outcome
for the Williams driver in the FIA-court scheduled for next Tuesday. This
means that this year's world championship will definetly be decided next
week on the Andalusian racetrack in Jerez.
