Abducted Germans in Yemen now (really) free
</H1>
The fate of the 7 German tourists who had been abducted in
Yemen only became clear this afternoon, when security forces announced
that the hostages were free, and were supposed to arrive in the capital,
San'a, this evening. A spokesman for the Foreign Office in Bonn confirmed
the announcement. The German ambassador in San'a, Duchess Strachwitz
(sp?), is supposed to have talked with one of the abducted men via
telephone. Further details of the release are not yet known.
It was announced yesterday that the drama was ended and the hostages
freed; this later proved to be an error.
The Germans had been abducted by approximately 50 armed Beduins in south
Yemen at the beginning of last week.

Special sitting of the Bundestag over nuclear waste transport
</H1>
Protests by miners and by opponents of the nuclear waste transport
to Gorleben have led to heated exchanges in the Bundestag. Members of the
governing coalition said during a special sitting of the parliament in
Bonn that offences such as violating the mile-wide protest ban around the
Bundestag, or acts of violence such as were seen recently in Gorleben must
not be accepted. They accused the SPD of playing on the fears of miners
and other citizens as a political tactic. The Opposition defended the
rights of miners to defend themselves against threatened lay-offs.

Kohl: compromise over coal subsidies possible
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed confidence that the
dispute over subsidies for coal mining can be settled at talks with the
chairman of the mining union (IG Bergbau), Berger, tomorrow. Kohl told
leading representatives of the economy in Munich that he wanted to
negotiate the stages of the planned cuts to the subsidies again. The
leaders of the CDU/CSU and the FDP in the Bundestag, Schaeuble and Solms,
had also already indicated that they were open to compromise. The speed of
the reduction is to be discussed again, even if the long-term goal of
halving coal subsidies, to approximately 4 billion Marks a year, by the
year 2005 remained.
<P>
The miners interrupted their protests in Bonn and pulled back to Cologne,
where the union set up a city of tents for the 5,000-8,000 miners.
However, they want to return to Bonn if tomorrow's talks with the
Chancellor do not result in an agreement. A demonstration in Cologne is
planned for this evening.
<P>
At a protest in Bonn, SPD parliamentary leader Scharping said this morning
that his party would only resume talks with the coalition about tax reform
when the future of coal mining without lay-offs was assured.
The chairman of the IG Metall union, Zwickel, called on the Federal
Government to yield in the conflict over coal subsidies. Otherwise, he
said, there would be flare-ups of social unrest which would not be
restricted to mining.

Cubic capacity auto tax to be changed into emissions tax
</H1>
As of July 1 of this year, automobiles will be taxed higher the more
pollution they put into the atmosphere. The mediation committee of
Bundestag and Bundesrat agreed to a compromise according to which the
owners of environmentally burdensome older autos will be required to pay
more and more. Lower taxes are intended for vehicles which meet the most
current European norms.
The Federal Government wants to abolish the vehicle tax in favour of the
oil tax. However, since the vehicle tax generates revenue for the states,
and the oil tax is federal, no agreement has been reached in that regard.
Environment Minister Merkel welcomed the committee's agreement,
anticipating that it would now be possible to drive vehicles without a
catalytic converter out of circulation through market forces.

Kohl announces investments to create jobs
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Kohl has announced investments worth 25 billion
Marks to create jobs in the construction industry. In a top-level
discussion with Germany's largest business associations during the
International Trades Fair, in Munich, Kohl said the federal cabinet would
discuss the measures in the coming week.
<P>
The money is to come, to a large extent, from the funds of the
Reconstruction Loan Corporation, as well as the German Equalization Bank.
The Chancellor also called on the SPD to resume talks about tax reform.
Kohl said that he expected of the SPD that they should resume the
negotiations quickly, without playing in partisan tactics.
The government's social and tax policies were at the center of the talks
in Munich, in which the Trades President Phillip (sp?), President Stihl of
the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, President Hundt of the
employers' association, and Industry President Henkel took part, in
addition to Kohl.
<P>
In Berlin, several thousand construction workers demonstrated for the
third day in a row against increasing unemployment in the industry, and
also against low pay.

Negotiations about part-time work for older workers
</H1>
The IG Metall union and the employers' association Gesamtmetall
began negotiations over part-time work for older workers and a reform of
the general wage agreement this afternoon.
On the table is a suggestion from the union chairman, Riester (sp?). His
model for part-time work for older workers has employees working full time
for 5 years beginning when they are 55 years old, and then not at all for
a further 5 years, while receiving 85 percent of their wages for all ten
years, until mandatory retirement. The employers have rejected the
suggestion as being too expensive.
<P>
The president of Gesamtmetall, Stumpfe, said that he expected the
negotiations to be difficult, and that a new agreement on the wage
contract system would probably not be possible before the end of the year.
Union leader Zwickel said that an agreement on part-time work for older
workers would be required before any progress could be made on the wage
contracts.

and hospitality enterprises were the worst affected. Statisticians

Protests against health cuts
</H1>
Hamburg/Bad Gandersheim. The president of the Chamber of Doctors in
Hamburg, Montgomeri (sp?), has sharply criticized Federal Health Minister
Seehofer's latest bill intended to curb costs in the health system. He
said on Deutschlandradio Berlin that the sick were having their pockets
picked, while employers and the healthy were "doing fine". Montgomeri, who
is also the chairman of the Marburg chapter of the Association of Hospital
Doctors, also objected to the so-called "hard case" regulations. He said
that those affected would have to collect documents all year long and give
them to their insurance company, which would drive administrative costs
through the roof.
<P>
Doctors, other health care providers, and patients protested today in Bad
Gandersheim, in Lower Saxony, against health cuts. About 2,000 people took
part in the demonstration. They called for solidarity with the sick and
with those working in the health care system.
<P>
The coalition's bill provides for an increase of 5 Marks across the board
in the percent excess for members of the state insurance companies,
probably as of July 1. Also, "hard case" regulations for those with low
incomes and the chronically ill are to be introduced.

New findings in case of fatal fire in Luebeck last year
</H1>
The Regional Court today reconstructed the fatal fire in a
refugees' residence in Luebeck last year with the help of a computer
simulation. The simulation supported the view of the expert witness,
Achilles, that the fire began in the entryway of the house.
The public prosecutor is claiming that the accused, Eid, set the fire on
the second floor of the building. The Federal Criminal Office attested
that scenario, also using a computer simulation.
The fire killed 10 people and injured 38 in January of last year.

"Weimar children" murder case in court again

In the new trial dealing with the murder of the two "Weimar
children", former American soldier Kevin Pratt testified today. He
described his relationship with Monika Boettcher, who carried the name of
Weimar before her divorce, and with her daughters, saying that it was
familiar and loving, and that the children treated him almost like a
father. The prosecution accuses Monika Boettcher of killing her daughters
because they stood in the way of her relationship with Pratt. The accused
denies the charges, and accuses her former husband of the murders.
