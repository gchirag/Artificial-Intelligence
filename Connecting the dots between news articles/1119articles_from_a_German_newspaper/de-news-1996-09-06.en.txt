Commemoration of 50th anniversary of "Speech on hope"
</H1>
US Foreign Minister Christopher attended the Baden-Wuerttemberg
government's celebration of the 50th anniversary of a speech delivered by
the then foreign minister, Mr Burns. Mr Burns' speech had set the pace for a
new US-policy towards Germany. One and a half years after WWII had come to
an end, Mr Burns had pleaded for an economically united Germany, across
borders drawn up by the Allies, and also for an independent German
government. On 6 September 1946 Mr James F.Burns said in his historical
speech at the Stuttgart Opera House, that the people of the United States
would support Germany's economic re-building and her re-admission to the
community of democratic countries. Mr Burns thus reached out to Germany, who
was on her knees, offering peace and friendship. The speech, however, also
sent signals to the other Allies: that the Unites States would discontinue
the process of setting up and running an allied administration of Germany
(as set out in the Potsdam Treaty). Today, 50 years after the event, German
and American politicians wished to commemorate this turning-point in the
relations between the two countries.

No change of direction for Greens party
</H1>
The Greens are not changing direction, according to Ms Mueller, head of the
party in Bonn, when commenting on the elections to their parliamentary group.
And she emphasised on radio Deutschlandfunk this morning, spokes-person
Mr Fischer's getting less votes than 2 years ago, should not be seen as a
way of penalising him; but rather as a reflection of what ordinary voters
within the party thought. Ms Mueller, who allegedly is close to the left
wing, emphasised that environmental politics were of fundamental importance
to her party. Re-building Germany's economy under ecological aspects would
also work wonders for Germany as a manufacturing site. Ms Mueller criticised
government for not having realised the latter so far.

Day two of Graf tax-trial
</H1>
Day two of the Graf tax-trial at the Mannheim Regional Court saw
more depositions by Mr Graf's consultant, Mr Eckhardt. Yesterday Mr Graf had
stated that the tax authorities had not informed him on time about any
initial suspicions they would have had. Messrs Graf and Eckhardt are alleged
to have evaded tax to the tune of 20 million marks.
According to Mr Eckhardt, Steffi Graf did know that her revenues from
advertising would be channelled in order to evade tax. His predecessor,
Mr Schmidt, had told him that the whole Graf family had been informed about
the tax-saving scheme. He did not know, however, if Mr Schmidt had warned
about the inherent dangers of getting found out and taken to court. In 1992
he had learned about the splitting of sponsors' contracts and money transfers.

This summer's bad weather helps travel industry
</H1>
Travel agents in Germany would have suffered catastrophic results, according
to their federation, if the bad weather had not provided a powerful
incentive to travel to far-way places after all. This year the industry
would only just break even, whereas the travel agents would actually lose a
bit of money.
