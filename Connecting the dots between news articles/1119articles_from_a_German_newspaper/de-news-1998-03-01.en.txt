</H1>
The State Premier of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Schroeder, will be the Social
Democrats' candidate for the chancellorship. This was announced by the
party's Secretary General, Mr. Muentefehring, in Bonn. Mr. Schroeder
will be officially nominated as the candidate on Monday. Gerhard
Schroeder himself stated on the subject of his candidature: "Although
the committees will not decide until tomorrow, I assume that the result
of the election is such that I will be nominated. Oscar Lafontaine has
called me and asked if he can propose my nomination with my consent. Of
course I gave my consent, that is what was to be expected. And therefore
things will proceed with great unity tomorrow."

Election in Lower Saxony
</H1>
Today's election in Lower Saxony has long been regarded as a test of
public opinion for the parliamentary election in September. The result
of the election also determines if State Premier Gerhard Schroeder will
be nominated by his party as candidate for the chancellorship. Mr.
Schroeder has announced that he will only be a candidate if he does not
lose more than 2 percent of the vote compared to the result of the 1994
election. The SPD received 44.3 percent of the votes in Lower Saxony in
1994. The Christian Democrats' candidate, Christian Wulff, together with
the FDP, is aiming for a change of government. In the last state
elections, the CDU received 36.4 percent of the votes, while the
Liberals missed the 5 percent mark which would have guaranteed them a
place in the state parliament.
