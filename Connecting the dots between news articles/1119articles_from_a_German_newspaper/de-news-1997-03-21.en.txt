Tax-reform talks between government and SPD apparently failed
</H1>
Apparently the negotiations between government and SPD about the planned
tax-reforms have failed, for the time being. Mr Hintze, of the CDU, said
that at present Chancellor Kohl could not see why he should meet
Mr Lafontaine, of the SPD. The latter, however, emphasised that the two
heads of their parties would have to meet for the talks to resume. He also
asked for additional labour-costs to be lowered as of 1 July 1997, and
for families to be taxed less, as of the beginning of 1998.
