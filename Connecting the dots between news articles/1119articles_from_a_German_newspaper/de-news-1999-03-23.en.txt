CSU faction is outraged at suggestion to name Reichstag
</H1>
The official naming of the Reichstag building that is to house the
Bundestag, the lower house of parliament continues to stir up discussions.
Michael Glos, head of the CSU Bundestag faction said that his faction was
outraged about the Parliamentary Council of Elders decision last week to
agree on the name "Plenarbereich Reichstagsgebaeude" (Plenary area
Reichstag building). The faction did not and will not agree, said Mr. Glos.
[The Reichstag was the name of the legislative assembly in the Holy Roman
Empire of the German Nation, the German Empire 1871-1918 and in the German
Republic 1918-1945. The building (built 1884-94) that housed the Reichstag
is also called 'Reichstag' for short. The question is whether to stick to
the old name that for some has connotations with the Nazi era or to find a
new name.]

</H1>
This spring, the German government wants to present a reform of the
enterprise tax that will have a uniform maximum rate of 35 percent. This
was announced by Economics Minister Werner Mueller in a meeting with
industry associations. The German Industrial Federal Association (BdI)
welcomed the reform but doubted that the date could be met. In a joint
declaration the industry associations criticized the current level of taxes
and levies and demanded a socio-political re-orientation by the government.
After the meeting both industry and government demonstrated their openness
for further talks. Mr. Mueller also pleaded against increasing the sales
tax to finance the reduction of the enterprise tax.

New nuclear safety agency for Southern Germany
</H1>
The CDU-lead state governments of Baden-Wuerttemberg
and Bavaria have to decided to create their own nuclear safety agency.
Independent German and foreign experts will advise the two states on
security issues [connected with the running of nuclear power stations].
The new (regional) agency is supposed to become a counterweight
to the recently reorganised federal nuclear safety agency. In the opinion
of Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Erwin Teufel and the Bavarian
Environment Minister, Mr Schnappauf, the new members of the federal
agency had been selected by Federal Environment Minister Juergen
Trittin for ideological reasons. The regional nuclear safety agency for
Southern Germany is supposed to take up its work in summer.

</H1>
At the Federal High Court, the Federal Public Prosecutor
has demanded the acquittal of a police man who in 1992 had shot an

that the officer had fulfilled his duty to avert dangers to the public
when he tried to stop the fleeing offender by shooting at his legs.
The fleeing man had ignored earlier warning shots. The Federal High
Court will give its verdict on Thursday.
