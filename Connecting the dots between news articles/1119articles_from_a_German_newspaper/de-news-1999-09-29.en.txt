German will not face death penalty in Iran
</H1>
German businessman Helmut Hofer will not face the death penalty in Iran. The
Iranian judiciary dropped the case against him, initiated in 1998, of sexual
relations with a Muslim woman. According to his attorneys, the 58-year-old
will now only face charges of "illegal contact" with the woman. They expect
Hofer to be released within a few days, at which point he would then also
get back his 300,000 DM bail.

No decision on sending troops to East Timor
</H1>
The federal government has put off making a decision about sending German
medical troops to East Timor until next Wednesday. A government spokesman
said that the Bundestag must approve of the sending of around 100 soldiers
under the auspices of the international peace-keeping mission. According to
government sources, the cabinet could not reach an agreement on funding for
the mission.
East Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo, at the start of his visit to Germany,
called for a Marshall Plan for the destroyed region. He appealed to Germans
to help with the rebuilding of his country.

Schroeder defends Hombach
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has defended his former Chancellery
Minister Bodo Hombach against all accusations in connection with the
construction of the latter's house. Following a hearing before the
Bundestag's European Committee, Schroeder said that the accusations against
Hombach had been refuted by independent experts. About the hearing itself,
he said nothing; it had been agreed that the proceedings would not be made
public.
The CDU/CSU had indicated it would base its decision about whether or not to
apply for the instigation of an examination committee against Hombach on the
outcome of the hearing.

IG Metall union makes offer to employers
</H1>
In the high-level wage negotiations in Frankfurt, the IG Metall union has
offered employers a medium-range (rather than the usual short-term)
settlement - if the federal government will change existing laws to allow
for retirement at the age of 60, rather than 65. The chairman of the
employers' association, Werner Stumpfe, rejected the idea. He said it would
be too great a financial burden, not only on the companies, but also on the
younger workers.
No date has been set for further talks. Until such time, union leader Klaus
Zwickel said, workgroups will discuss the most-disputed questions.

Dressler: Compromise on medication regulations
</H1>
The SPD's social policy expert, Rudolf Dressler, has suggested a compromise
in the government's dispute with doctors over public health insurers'
expenses for medications. Dressler's office this evening confirmed a report
to that effect in the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper. The suggestion sees
doctors prescribing 10 percent less medication starting in the year 2000; in
exchange, they would be absolved of any collective responsibility if the
insurers' overspent. The head of the concerned doctors' association,
Winfried Schorre, welcomed the move.
Federal Health Minister Andrea Fischer will discuss the idea of absolving
doctors of collective responsibility with experts within the federal
coalition on Friday.
