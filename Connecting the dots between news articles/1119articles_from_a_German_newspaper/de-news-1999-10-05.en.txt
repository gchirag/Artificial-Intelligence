top of the existing savings plans. The goal being a budget in which
expenditure is lower than income, said Eichel to the BILD newspaper.
Reducing the budget deficit will not suffice. The minister called upon
the union-led states in the Bundesrat to support the savings plans. He

Eichel rejects union tax plan
</H1>
Finance minister Eichel has rejected the union's tax plan. Eichel said
that the resulting high national debt is not acceptable. "Only those
who are not responsible for the national finances, can present such a
proposal", said Eichel in response to the union's tax proposals.
Eichel calculated that the first step alone would create a budget
deficit of 18 billion DM. After the union, on their part, criticised
the government's savings and tax plans as unsuitable, the two fronts
are set for the parliamentary debates in the Bundesrat and the
mediation committee. In all probability, the decision on the tax plan
of the future will be made there.

Committee for municipal income redistribution Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
In Baden-Wuerttemberg the municipal income redistribution will from
now on be handled by a committee. The committee is, at any time, made
up of 3 representatives of the state and the districts. With the
appointment of the committee, the state's government is reacting to a
decision made by the state constitutional court in May of this year.
The decision included a demand for better protection of districts'
administration from financial interventions by the state. The main
reason for the lawsuit was to garner more funds for cities, districts
and state social services, who have been especially affected by
welfare costs.
