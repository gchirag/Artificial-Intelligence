Kohl and Junker encourage positive thinking about European unification
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl and the out-going president of the European Union,
Luxembourg's Prime Minister Junker, are urging Germans to see
globalization and the unification of Europe as a budding opportunity.
Rather than always just complaining, Germany must step into the third
millennium full of realistic optimism, as Kohl said at a "Europe
convention" held by the CDU/CSU parliamentary group. He added that an
economically splintered Europe would not stand a chance in international
competition in the long run.

RWE to sue Rhineland-Palatinate for DM 9 billion
</H1>
The RWE energy company intends to sue the state of Rhineland-Palatinate
for damages because of errors in the permit which the state issued the
company to operate the Muehlhiem-Kaerlich nuclear power plant. RWE board
member, Hlubek, in an interview with the newspaper "Die Welt", spoke of a
sum of DM 9 billion. On Suedwestfunk radio this evening, Hlubek said the
plant would now most likely be torn down; some equipment would be sold;
and reconstruction would take ten years. According to the Suedwestfunk,
the cost of dismantling the plant would run in at DM 1 billion.
The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin ruled this morning that the
nuclear power plant could not be brought into operation again because it
was not earthquake-proof.

Opposition criticizes Kanther's attitude on refugee policies
</H1>
At a Special Sitting of the Bundestag in Bonn today, the Opposition
criticized Internal Affairs Minister Kanther's attitude on refugee
policies. SPD internal affairs critic, Koerper, accused Kanther of
generating an atmosphere of hysteria by speaking as he has of a mass
influx of Kurds into Europe. Koerper added that it was not particularly
helpful to point the finger of blame at the Italian government either. A
Green Bundestag member, Dietert-Scheuer (sp?), said the minister was
agitating for malicious policies aimed at completely sealing Europe's
borders. Kanther defended his views and pointed to the increasing numbers
of Kurdish refugee claimants, saying that the threat posed by such a flood
was alarming.

Hamburg wants aircraft landing fees dependent on emissions
</H1>
The city of Hamburg wants to charge landing fees commensurate with
aircraft exhaust emissions at its Fuhlsbuettel airport in the future. The
City Parliament unanimously approved the motion by the Greens/Alternative
List. The plan must still be approved by the Hamburg Economic Authority,
which sets the take-off and landing charges. If it agrees, Fuhlsbuettel
will become the first airport in Germany to tie landing fees to emission
levels.

Export ban on British beef to be loosened
</H1>
Almost two years after the ban on the export of British beef was imposed,
London can hope for the restrictions to be eased. The EU Commission has
suggested that beef exports from Northern Ireland be permitted, under
certain conditions. The animals would have to come from herds in which
there has been no case of mad cow disease in the last few years; that
information would be kept track of by computer. EU Agricultural
Commissioner Fischler has not named a date for the implementation of the
suggested new regulations; the other members of the EU must agree to the
idea first.

Bundeswehr investigation committee begins its work
</H1>
An investigation committee reporting to the Bundestag began its
investigation of extreme right-wing activities in the German armed forces
today. It is the Defence Committee which has been entrusted with this job.
Participants decided not to restrict the investigation to formally
documented occurrences of right-wing or anti-foreigner acts, but rather to
include also the current conditions within the armed forces and the
attitudes of the soldiers. This expanded mandate had been demanded by the
SPD and the Greens. It is not yet clear who will be called to testify.
Hearings are set to begin on February 4.

Health committee declines to take position on anti-smoking law
</H1>
The Bundestag's health committee has not issued a position in the battle
over a law to protect non-smokers. The chairman of the committee, Thomae
(FDP), issued a statement following the committee's final meeting, to the
effect that members of the Bundestag should vote according to their
conscience, without any outside influence.
At issue is a joint motion by 125 representatives from the Government and
the Opposition to ban smoking in businesses and public spaces. The
Hartmannbund doctors' association told the "Berliner Kurier" newspaper
that it was against excessive regulation in this regard.
