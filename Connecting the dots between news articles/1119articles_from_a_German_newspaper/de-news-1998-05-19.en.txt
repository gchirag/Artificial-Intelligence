CDU party congress closes with adoption of election platform
</H1>
The delegates of the CDU federal party congress in Bremen have adopted
unanimously the so-called Future Programme. The document has been developed
by faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble and is the base for a joint election
platform of CDU and CSU. Amongst others, the platform is stipulating
employment for everyone and to boost Germany's economic ability. It also
retains a demand for a European energy tax. This demand had temporarily
caused arguments with the CSU. Earlier in his speech, Schaeuble said the
CDU vouches for political and economic stability. The party congress also
adopted a policy against coalitions with left or right extremist parties.
In the closing speech, Chancellor Helmut Kohl called again on all members
to fight wholeheartedly for a victory in the federal elections.
The Liberal FDP welcomed the results of the CDU party congress and called
it an end of the loss of direction. Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Die
Gruenen, however, criticized that at closer view the party platform was
nothing but an "as before" programme.

Geissler advocates "honest" election campaigning
</H1>
Heiner Geissler, deputy president of the CDU/CSU faction has advocated
"honest" election campaigning. The CDU had to address the problems and
justify why the party should be re-elected, Geissler said in a dpa
interview. In an interview with the Rheinische Post about the same topic
Geissler is reported as warning against saying that SPD
chancellor-candidate Gerhard Schroeder would accept the votes of the
Socialist PDS to become chancellor. Geissler said in the dpa interview that
the Rheinische Post interview was not authorized by him and does not
reflect his opinion.

Waigel calls for lower EU contributions by Germany
</H1>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel thinks Germany should pay lower net
contributions to the European Union. At a meeting of EU finance ministers
Waigel said he wants a declaration to this effect already in June. If this
question is not solved, other questions wouldn't be solved either. Germany
pays just under 30% of the EU's budget but the EU is investing less in
Germany. The difference between the two numbers is the net contribution
that Waigel wants to reduce.

paired with economic reason.

Municipal garbage and waste water fees are not subject to sales tax
</H1>
The Federal Financial Court has ruled that municipal garbage collection and
waste water fees are not subject to a sales tax. Thus, impending fee raises
have been averted. The court had to rule about a waste water alliance in
Brandenburg. The court found that the alliance was acting under sovereign
jurisdiction and therefore need not collect a sales tax. The finding is in
line with an earlier ruling about garbage collection. The federal
government had intended to tax the municipal services to remove
disadvantages for private service companies.
