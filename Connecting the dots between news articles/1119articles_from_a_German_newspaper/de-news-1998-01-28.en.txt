VW must pay EU fine of DM 202 million
</H1>
The Volkswagen company is facing an EU-imposed fine of DM 202 million for
having forbidden its foreign dealers to sell vehicles to Germans.
Thirty-six German and Austrian car-buyers submitted official complaints
because they were refused the purchase of the vehicles, which at the time
were much cheaper in Italy. Today's decision does not directly grant them
the right to monetary compensation, although they could use it as the
basis for civil suits for recompense.
The prices for Audis and VWs in Italy at that time were about 30 percent
lower than in Germany.
The fine is the largest that the EU has ever laid on an individual
company. Volkswagen intends to challenge the decision at the European
Supreme Court.

Lutheran Church criticizes Papal letter
</H1>
The head of the German Lutheran Church Council, Kock, has criticized the
Papal letter against certified pregnancy counselling. He told the
Saarbruecker Zeitung newspaper that the Catholic Church pulling out of
pregnancy counselling would only serve to weaken the forces working for
the benefit of the unborn. (German women seeking abortions must supply a
certificate proving that they have been to mandatory pregnancy
counselling.)
He also said that the fact that a centralized decision was handed down in
this case, which could have been left to the responsibility of the local
Church, was, from the Protestant point of view, disquieting.

Policemen charged with failing to give assistance
</H1>
The Public Prosecutor's Office has initiated proceedings against two
policemen, on charges of failing to give assistance, in the case of the
12-year-old girl named Karla. Emergency medical personnel have apparently
sharply criticized the officers for inaction at the scene of the sex
crime. Police officials rejected the accusation that the policemen failed
in their duty to provide first aid to the girl, saying that they had to
assume, from all appearances, that the girl was already dead. The Public
Prosecutor's Office confirmed, following the initial examination of the
audio recording of the rescue efforts made at the rescue coordination
centre, that the officers and the rescue helicopter arrived at the scene
at almost exactly the same time. Strangulation marks on the girl's throat
and signs of a struggle at the scene indicate that the 12-year-old
defended herself fiercely against her attacker and, according to the
doctors, was thrown into the pond already unconscious. Even the emergency
doctor's half-hour long attempt at resuscitation only succeeded in
restoring Karla's blood circulation, but not her brain functions.
