Organisation of the Green Party
</H1>
German Foreign Minister Juergen Fischer has said that he does not approve
of the current public debate over the organisation of his party, the
Greens. He said on the ZDF television programme that the Greens would not
achieve anything by such a debate. He continued that it is necessary to
discuss such issues within party circles, quietly, in order to reach the
necessary conclusions about the party's current problems. Leading
politicians of the Party had unleashed a new discussion about party
leadership over the weekend. Andrea Fischer (Minister of Health) and Mr.
Vesper (Minister of Construction in North Rhine-Westphalia) had demanded
that the current double party leadership be abolished in favour of clear
leadership. They complained that the difference of opinions in the party
has lead to public alarm over the situation.

Pensions to be adjusted to inflation rate
</H1>
Federal Minister of Labour Riester is insisting that pension increases be
linked to inflation in the next two years. Mr. Riester said to the "Bild"
newspaper that demands on the state pension fund would be too great if
the current far-reaching reforms are not pushed through. He continued
that unrestrained pension expenditure would lead to a dramatic situation
and emphasised that using an tax increases to finance the pension fund
would not be a solution. Mr. Riester said that even a decrease in the
unemployment rate would not be able to stop the current rapid increase in
pension expenditure.

FDP against pension reform
</H1>
The FDP plans to block the proposed reforms to the pension system by
means of their votes in the Bundesrat (Upper House of Parliament) for the
German State of Rhineland-Paletinate. This state is currently governed by
a SPD-FDP coalition. Mr. Bruederle, acting leader of the FDP, said that
the FDP would not help to break election promises and that the
Rhineland-Paletinate would not approve the changes. The current red-green
coalition would as a result not be able to achieve the necessary majority
approval in the Bundestag (the Lower House of Parliament).

Flexible Christmas bonus
</H1>
Employers in the Metal, Engineering and Electronics industries have
confirmed their demand for more flexibility in paying Christmas bonuses.
They would like to link Christmas bonuses to profits and plan to have put
this on on the agenda at the coming IG-Metall summit (Union for the
Metal, Engineering and Electronics industries). According to Mr. Stumpfe,
head of the "Gesamtmetall" Employers' association, more flexibility in
paying Christmas bonuses would mean more money for employees in good
times and protect against employment cutbacks in bad times. Mr. Stumpfe
announced, in addition, that employers plan to talk to the Union about
reducing overtime.

Many former East German officials in state employment
</H1>
According to Mr. Gauck, Federal Official for Stasi Files (the Stasi was
the secret service of the former East Germany), many former highly-placed
East-German officials are still in public service. Mr. Gauck said in an
interview on the ARD television programme that the rapid adoption of the
West's more liberal legal criteria had led to culprits being treated with
rather too much "care". They had been granted a gentle transition,
whereas the victims of the system had lost their right to reparation. Mr.
Gauck said that he regretted that many former East Germans did not have
the courage to face their past.
