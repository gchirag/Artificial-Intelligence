First Personnel Decisions For The New Government
</H1>
In the anticipated red-green coalition, Oskar Lafontaine will become
finance minister and Rudolf Sharping defense minister after all. The
future chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, made this announcement after
a special session of the party leadership. The heated fight for the
chair of the SPD faction has subsided, even though Scharping is said
to have fought against his transfer to the "Hardthoehe" (Ministry of
Defense). The future chancellor Schroeder revealed that Scharping
will become the new defense minister and that Oskar Lafontaine will
move into the Ministry of Finance--neither of which came as a surprise.
Federal Secretary-General Muentefering could become the new Minister
of Building and Construction. Peter Struck, parliamentary secretarygeneral, is said to be the strongest candidate as Scharping's successor
for party leadership.

Employers of the metal industry to discuss Zwickel's pension model
</H1>
The employers of the metal industry proposed talks to the union for
metal, engineering and electronics on the pension model of union
leader Zwickel. A spokesperson for the employers' association for
the steel and engineering industry said in Cologne that they are
looking for details of the proposal which intends to buffer earlier
pension starts using a wage fund. Especially noteworthy is Zwickels'
idea of financing the contributions from other possible increases
in employee incomes using the generation agreement. However,
employers remain largely skeptical.

Sickness figure reaches all-time low
</H1>
The sickness figures of obligatorily insured persons at company sickness benefit funds reached its all-time low last year. The federal
association of company sickness benefit funds in Bonnn announced that
disability averaged 18 days. In 1991, the average was 26 days. The
federal association called the difficult situation on the job market
and the various company agreements on reducing the missing work times
as the reasons for the noticeable decline in sickness figures.

Currently no hospital emergency contribution by "AOK" members
</H1>
At the present time, members of the employee sickness benefit fund in
Baden-Wuerttemberg will not have to pay a hospital emergency contribution in the amount of 20 DM. It is to be seen what stance the new
federal government will take in this matter. Originally, the hospitals
were to receive a contribution from the obligatorily insured persons.
