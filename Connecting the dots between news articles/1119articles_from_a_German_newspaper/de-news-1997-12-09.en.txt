4.32 million unemployed in Germany
</H1>
In November, the number of unemployed people in Germany
rose by 31,000 to 4.32 million, representing an unemployment rate of 11.3%,
up from 11.2%. In the West, the rate is at 9.5%, while it is at 18.3% in the
East. At the presentation of the new figures, President of the Federal
Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said there were no indications that the number
of unemployed people will break through the mark of five million this winter.
On the other hand, while there are certain signs for approaching the peak,
a turn-around is still out of sight. The economic growth is obviously not
big enough to stop the slashing of jobs. Mr Jagoda also called on the
companies to provide for more apprenticeships.

<P>
Against the federal trend, the number of unemployed people slightly decreased
by 2,000 to 370,000 in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the unemployment
rate thus being at 7.5% there. In Bavaria the rate rose from 7.0% to 7.1%.

<P>
The economic expert of the SPD faction in the Bundestag (lower house of
parliament), Mr Schwanholdt, demanded that the government immediatly
provide additional funds for job creation schemes. Only a decisive action
might prevent the rise of the number of unemployed people to five million.
Given the new unemployment figures, the German federation of unions (DGB)
voiced the hope for a turn-around in the job market in 1998.

Student protests in Stuttgart
</H1>
Some 15,000 students, pupils and university employees from all
over Baden-Wuerttemberg protested today in Stuttgart against the financial
calamaties at colleges and universities. Among other things, the protesters
demanded better equipment, and criticised the call for tution fees and the
(bad) shape university libraries are in.

<P>
The State Minister for Science and Research, Mr Trotha, spoke at meeting
as well. Under wild catcalls he defended his education policies. The
minister offered [to students and teachers] an "Alliance for training",
within which the demands of students for an improvement in the quality of
teaching will also be considered.

State of the forest report: 59% of all trees ill
</H1>
The Federal cabinett has passed the latest "State of the forest" report
according to which as much as 20% of the German forest is still considerably
damaged.  A further 39% of all trees are slightly damaged. A total of 59%
are thus affected by recognisable damage, up from 57% last year. Federal
Agricultural Minister Juergen Borchert stressed, however, that some species
such as pine trees and spruces have improved considerably in 1997. The state
of the oaks, on the other hand, was alarming.

<P>
Environmental activists reproached the minister with masking the real extend
of the problem. The SPD environmental expert, Mr Mueller, called the report
an "alarm signal". The fact that there are hardly any old oak trees left that
are not damaged illustrated the catastrophic extend of the creeping death of
the woods. Mr Mueller called for "ecological taxes" and speed limits to
reduce
nitrogen emissions.

Further legislation passed by cabinett
</H1>
The cabinett passed a decree today according to which buyers of new
car batteries have to pay a deposit of DM15, in case they do not exchange
it directly for an old one. In general, consumers can deposit all old
batteries at the shops.

<P>
The cabinett also passed a bill making it easier to implement flexible
working hours. In particular, the bill provides for better social security
for affected employees.

<P>
A further decree is aimed at helping private telephone customers to defend
their rights against the new telephone companies from next year on. [On
January 1, 1998 the telephone market in Germany will be liberalised.]

<P>
The Federal government also decided not to reconstruct its nuclear bunker
at Mariental-upon-Aar, but to close it down.

50 people injured after train crash in Hanover
</H1>
At a crash of a passenger train and a freight train at Hanover in
the late afternoon, at least 50 people suffered injuries. For an yet
unknown reason, the commuter train between Hanover and Celle crashed
head-on into a freight train from Hamburg. Two of the 22 tank waggons
of the freight train exploded and caught fire at the crash. As for now,
the fire fighters have succeeded in preventing the explosion of further
waggons. The driver of the passenger train and a woman have suffered severe
injuries.

Ruehe comitted to rapid investigation of Roeder case
</H1>
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe has announced a rapid investigation
of the scandal around the right extremist Mr Roeder. Mr Ruehe said
the government will lay open all facts known to them about the case
at the Bundestag [lower house of parliament] session tomorrow. The
Defense committee of the Bundestag will look into the affaire tomorrow.
Mr Ruehe refused again to step down because of the incident. It was now
his job to defend the Bundeswehr [the German Armed Forces] against the
unfounded suspicions it was honey-combed with right extremists. The SPD
considers demanding a [Bundestag] fact-finding committee to investigate
the appearance of Mr Roeder at Bundeswehr's Staff Academy three years
ago.

<P>
In connection with the gift of Bundeswehr vehicles to Mr Roeder,
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel reproached the staff of his Ministry
with negligence. The staff who was in charge of the application
of the "German-Russian Association", founded by Mr Roeder, had failed
to investigate the background of the association, said a spokesperson
of the Ministry. This was rebuked and disapproved by the Minister.

<P>
The Head of the German Bundeswehr Association, Colonel Gertz, has
called for further action by Defense Minister Volker Ruehe. The colonel
said yesterday's suspension of one of responsible staff was
not enough. It was necessary to investigate the climate in which
"slips" can bread such as the fact that none of the audience
of Roeder's talk reported the incidence.

PKK remains illegal in Germany
</H1>
The Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), and connected and
sub-organisations remain banned in Germany. The Federal Administrative
Court dismissed a corresponding complaint by one of the affected
Kurdish organisations. The Federal government had banned the PKK after
attacks on Turkish organisations four years ago.

Illegaly parked cars can be towed-away after one hour
</H1>
The Hessian Administrative Court has decided that cars parked
without a valid permit can be towed-away after a waiting period of one
hour, even when the illegally parked car did not obstruct traffic.
It was legal and necessary, said the court, that the space was freed
for legally parking cars.

Talks on tax and pension reforms
</H1>
Politicians of the governing coalition and the SPD met again
tonight for further talks on the tax and pension reforms. Both sides
were optimistic to find at least an agreement for changing the pension
system. To avoid an increase of pension payments to 21%, the FDP
finally agreed to support an increase of the value added tax. In
addition, the SPD demands restrictions for the so-called DM610 jobs
from 1999 on.

<P>
The new Postal Services bill was also on the agenda of the talks. First
talks in Sunday had ended without results. If both parties can not
find a compromise on the issue, the old bill will expire without a
replacement at the end of the year.
