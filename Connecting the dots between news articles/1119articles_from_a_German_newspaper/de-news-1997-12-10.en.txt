continuing. Yesterday evening, at least 50 persons were injured in a
collision between a freight train and a regional passenger train
carrying 300 passengers. The fire department estimates that
approximately 100,000 liters of diesel fuel were spilled from damaged
tankers.  Two of the tanks completely burned out. According to a
preliminary statement issued by the by the Public Prosecutors Office,
the fault lay with the engineer of the freight train. The
investigation of the signal station revealed no irregularities, said
Chief Prosecutor Witzer.  Workers at the signal station said they
observed the freight train accelerate as it passed.  At a previous
signal (set to stop), the engineer of the freight train did slow down,
but then accelerated again and ran the second red signal.  The two
trains crashed at a speed of nearly 40 km/h.  The engineer of the
freight is not available for questioning at this time, as he is in a
state of shock, and is under medical care.

Special investigator commissioned in Bundeswehr scandal
</H1>
The connection between right wing extremist Manfred Roeder and the
Bundeswehr is to be determined by a special investigator.  This
decision was taken by Defense Minister Ruehe, who put department head
Klaus Dau of Defense in charge of the investigation of the scandal.
Dau will present his report within a month, Ruehe stated at a defense
committee session.  The Minister also suggested to the deputies that
an independent commission should assemble an accurate picture of right
wing extremism within the Bundeswehr.  The Minister further confirmed
that the name of neo-nazi Roeder had already appeared on the first
letter of application by the ominous [Deutsch-Russisches]
Gemeinschaftswerk (German-Russian Joint Institute). The CDU politician
dismissed reports of an alleged new scandal video from 1990, however,
saying that he had informed the deputies about the video last week.
