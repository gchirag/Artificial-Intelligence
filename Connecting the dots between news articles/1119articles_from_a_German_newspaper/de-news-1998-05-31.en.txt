Alliance 90/The Greens want nuclear energy to be abandoned
</H1>
If they form part of the government after the general election, Alliance
90/The Greens will do all they can to see that nuclear energy is abandoned.
The environmental spokesperson for the Greens in the Bundestag (Lower House)
Mrs. Husted said in Bonn, the scandal surrounding the radioactive Castor
containers was no accident. If the dealings of the "nuclear Mafia" are to be
brought to an end, nuclear energy has to be abandoned. Mrs. Husted added,
that in view of the over-capacity on the electrical power market in Germany,
all nuclear power plants could be shut down. An entry into the solar age
with increased support for natural energy sources is perfectly realistic,
she said.

Red Cross flies aid to Afghanistan
</H1>
The Red Cross has flown the first planeloads of aid into the earthquake
region of Afghanistan. Planes took off from Kabul to the city of Fai Sabbat
(sp?). In addition to food and medical supplies, tents are urgently needed
because many survivors do not dare to return to their houses even if they
are still standing. The earthquake, which measured 7.1 on the Richter scale,
occurred yesterday in the north of Afghanistan and may have killed as many
as 5000 people.

Stoiber wants concessions if Czech Republic joins EU
</H1>
Bavaria's State Premier Mr. Stoiber wants the Czech Republic to make
concessions in exchange for being allowed to join the EU. In his speech on
the Whitsun meeting of the Sudeten Germans, he said that the Czech Republic
can only join the EU if the state repeals laws on the expulsion and
expropriation of the Sudeten Germans which were enacted after the war. This
is a central question, he said. Yesterday, the President of the Christian
Social Union (CSU) Mr. Waigel also demanded recognition for the right of the
Sudeten Germans to return to their homeland.

East German CDU criticizes Hintze's "Red Hands Campaign"
</H1>
In the East German Christian Democratic Union (CDU), criticism of the
party's "Red Hands Campaign" is growing. The billboards are as inappropriate
as the "Red Socks Campaign" in the 1994 election campaign, Saxonian Minister
of Justice Mr. Heitmann told the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag". He thinks that
the campaign will cause more voters to sympathize with the Party of
Democratic Socialism (PDS). The Secretary General of the Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania CDU Mr. Kafier called for meaningful debate with the successor to
the Socialist Unity Party, the former ruling party of East Germany (SED).
Earlier, the President of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania's CDU Mr. Rehberg
(sp?) had complained about the form of the campaign. CDU national Secretary
General Mr. Hintze wants to use the "Red Hands Campaign" to warn people
against a collaboration between the PDS and the Social Democratic Party
(SPD).

Murder case Christina: culprit still being questioned
</H1>
After an arrest in the murder case Christina Nitzsch, the police are still
questioning the suspect. They are trying to discover if the man was also
involved in the disappearance of 13 year-old Ulrike Everts in the district
of Ammerland. According to police, there are no indications of a connection
so far. The accused, who has three children of his own, has admitted
abducting, abusing and killing eleven year-old Christina. He was caught by
genetic finger printing and has been in detention since Friday.

Stockholders of Rolls-Royce want to prevent German takeover
</H1>
The stockholders of the car maker Rolls-Royce want to do everything they can
to keep the luxury brand in British hands. According to the newspaper
"Sunday Times", a group of wealthy car lovers and business people are
willing to pay 1.3 billion Marks, more than VW and BMW have offered. They
also plan to invest 1 billion Marks in the development of new models. Stock
holders of Rolls-Royce's parent company Vickers intend to make a final
decision on Friday. In the past weeks, VW had seemed to be the most likely
candidate.

Whitsun sermons
</H1>
Protestant and Catholic churches have called for spiritual independence and
optimism in their Whitsun sermons. During a service at the St. Katherine's
church in Hamburg, the city's bishop Mrs. Jepsen (sp?) said that in our
multicultural society there must be more exchange about different forms of
religion. Speaking in the Liebfrauendom [cathedral], the Archbishop of
Munich, Cardinal Wetter, called for optimism in spite of the nuclear test by
India and Pakistan. Not nuclear bombs, but God's spirit will prevail in the
end, he said.

FDP rejects criticism of Foreign Minister over exiles
</H1>
The Free Democrats (FDP) have rejected criticisms made by the CSU and exile
organizations against German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. Secretary
General Mr. Westerwelle said in Bonn that these statements are expression of
a policy that is oriented toward the past. If the German government was to
adopt the demands of the Bavarian State Premier Stoiber or the exiles, this
would marginalize German foreign policy. Mr. Westerwelle stressed that the
FDP will protect foreign policy from red-green unpredictability as well as
against posturing by the Bavarian CSU.

Kohl calls on Germans to show more community involvement
</H1>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called on Germans to demonstrate more
community spirit and volunteer involvement. In his opening address at the
30th German Gymnastics Festival in Munich, he said that the 2.5 million
people involved in German sports clubs are a pillar of democracy. The
matter-of-fact-ness with which people from different backgrounds work out
together shows the road ahead for other sections of society, he said. More
than 100,000 visitors are expected in the Bavarian capital for the largest
non-professional sports event in the world.
