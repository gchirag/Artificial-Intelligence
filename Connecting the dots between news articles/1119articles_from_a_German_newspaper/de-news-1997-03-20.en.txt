Unemployment legislation passed despite Bundesrat veto
</H1>
Using the Coalition's parliamentary majority, the reform of legislation
governing the transition from unemployment to the work force and unemployment
benefit has finally been passed, despite the objections of the Bundesrat
[The Upper House of Parliament, consisting of representatives of the States,
currently under SPD majority].  The new law includes tougher rules as to
what types of employment a person receiving unemployment assistance must
accept.  Under the new regulations, after six months of unemployment people
are required to accept jobs in which they would earn up to 30% less than
they did previously.  Furthermore, they are obliged to accept any job offer,
even if the qualifications it requires are less than the candidate's
credentials.  The age limit for unemployment assistance is to be increased
from 42 to 45 years.  There will be fewer federal subsidies for job-creation
measures [ABM].  However, federal wage supplements for companies in the New
States will be expanded.
The majority of the new regulations will come into effect on April 1st;
the remainder on January 1st 1998.  The opposition voted against the reform.

Coalition accuses SPD of encouraging welfare fraud
</H1>
In a topical debate in Parliament, requested by the FDP, speakers of the
governing Coalition have accused the SPD of issuing a guidebook for
welfare recipients which encourages fraudulent benefit claims and offers
advice at the borderline of legality.  Conversely, speakers of the SPD,
The Greens and the PDS, called the recommendations guidelines for survival
in the obscure apparatus of social welfare regulations.

Bundeswehr mission in Tirana approved belatedly
</H1>
With an overwhelming majority, the Bundestag approved today ex post facto
the Bundeswehr's evacuation mission in Tirana.  Last Friday, helicopters of
the armed forces airlifted more than 100 foreigners, among them 21 Germans,
out of Albania.  Defense Minister Ruehe and Foreign Minister Kinkel
explained in Parliament that the mission had been imperative and had been
justified on constitutional grounds.  The Federal Constitutional Court
had granted the government the right to deploy troops abroad at its own
discretion, in the event of immediate danger.  Speakers of the SPD declared
that such a procedure should remain an exception.  They advocated, however,
designing legal guidelines to involve the Bundestag in urgent foreign
deployments of the Bundeswehr.

</H1>
The SPD board members Mr. Scharping, Mr. Voscherau, and Mr. Schleusser
received letters today from Finance Minister Waigel and the parliamentary
group leaders of CDU/CSU and FDP, Mr. Schaeuble and Mr. Solms, with an
offer to resume bipartisan discussions on the tax reform.  The letter read
that in principle, the positions of both sides on tax policy are not
very far apart.  The tax reform is on the Bundestag's agenda for tomorrow.
Another topic will be a legislative initiative backed by all parties
to ban the cloning of humans.

SPD reactions to the offer of bipartisan talks on tax reform
</H1>
SPD parliamentary group leader Mr. Scharping's first reaction was that new
negotiations are possible, but that Chancellor Kohl must first accept the
offer of SPD chairman Mr. Lafontaine for talks.  In the opinion of the SPD
deputy parliamentary group leader, Ms. Matthaeus-Maier, the SPD is willing to
reopen the tax discussion with the Coalition.  As a precondition, however,
Chancellor Kohl must signal clearly that the government wants an agreement,
said Ms. Matthaeus-Maier on Deutschlandfunk radio.  She rejected the proposal
of Finance Minister Waigel as useless, on the grounds that it would cause
huge deficits.  She added that the SPD's foremost goal is a reduction of the
employment overhead costs.  The Lower-Saxon Minister President Schroeder
recommended that his party move toward the government's position on tax and
energy.  Mr. Schroeder told the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper
that he doesn't care for tactical games.

</H1>
The workers at Krupp-Hoesch will resume production tomorrow.  The workers'
committee announced that the strikes in Dortmund and Bochum have been called
off, for the time being.  However, the workers would strike again on short

shut down, nor were guarantees given that economically motivated lay-offs
would be avoided.
