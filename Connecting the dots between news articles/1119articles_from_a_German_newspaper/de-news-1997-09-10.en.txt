Biting words at general session in the Bundestag
</H1>
The Government and the Opposition accused each other of
irresponsible politics in the Bundestag today; at the same time, however,
they left the way open for compromises on tax and pension reform.
SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine, speaking during the general debate on the
chancellery budget, said the Coalition was more concerned with staying in
power than with anything else, and that only a new beginning could solve
the country's problems. He also said that the Government's tax policies
were an outright scandal. SPD parliamentary leader Rudolf Scharping also
criticized the Government as lacking strength.
Federal Chancellor Kohl added his voice to the often raucous debate,
accusing the Social Democrats of always just repeating their complaint
that he was sitting tight and waiting for problems to fix themselves. He
said the SPD would do better to attack Germany's problems together with
the Coalition. Kohl said that if the SPD continued its blockade in the
Bundesrat, its chances in next year's elections were "zero". The
Chancellor also explicitly supported his Finance Minister, defending
Waigel against all criticism.
Leader of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Schaeuble, said he saw a
possibility of negotiating with the SPD over a small part of the planned
tax reform. He said the CDU/CSU would be willing to come to an agreement
with the SPD this year on the initial step of the reform for 1998, and
then to put off conditions for the next few years. Further steps, intended
to afford Germans tax relief to the tune of DM 30 billion, could follow
after the election.
The FDP has, so far, refused to deal with the SPD on the first step of tax
reform as an isolated element.

German economy continues to grow
</H1>
It has been two years since the German economy grew as strongly
as it did in the second quarter of this year. According to the Federal
Statistics Office, the gross domestic product (GDP) was up by 2.9 percent;
in the first quarter the figure was only 1.1 percent.
The federal deficit fell in the first half of this year, from 3.4 percent
of GDP to 3.1 percent. This is an important number for participation in
the European monetary union, as the Maastricht Treaty requires a ratio of
3 percent or less, with some exceptions allowed.

Baden-Wurttemberg to cut costs further
</H1>
The state government in Baden-Wurttemberg wants to continue its
pursuit of a savings-oriented budget. State Premier Teufel announced that
this was the result of a two-day closed party meeting in Asperg near
Ludwigsburg. "We will have to pursue savings in the future even more
rigorously than in the last few years," Teufel said.
Concrete measures were not put forward. It is still unclear whether the
state will amass new debt. It is obvious, however, that the government
will establish a new set of priorities for the future. In education,
Teufel wants to make major investments; then he wants to improve the
situation in the labour market, because "every unemployed person is one
too many."

creation of these special units.

Judgement in trial against former border guards
</H1>
The Regional Court in Stendal is to pass judgement today in the
trial of two former East German border guards. The two men are facing
charges stemming from the shooting death of West German journalist Kurt
Lichtenstein (sp?) 36 years ago. Lichtenstein was the first person killed
on the East-West German border following the erection of the Berlin Wall.
Lichtenstein was shot and killed while following a story on 12 October
1961, north of Wolfsburg near Zicheri.
The Public Prosecutor's Office has asked for a suspended sentence for
manslaughter for both men. Such a sentence would not be unusual: of 46
former border guards who have already stood trial just in Berlin, 44 were
given suspended sentences. The defence for the two accused in Stendal are
calling for acquittal, reasoning that the guards had not fired with the
intent to kill, but were only following orders.

Judges' and lawyers' groups criticize Kanther
</H1>
Judges' and lawyers' groups have condemned Federal Internal Affairs
Minister Kanther's "Action Security Net". They say the CDU politician is
just trying to ride on high emotions and exploit Germans' feelings of
insecurity. Instead of examining the causes of crime, he is looking for a
scapegoat, they say. Kanther had complained that the justice department
was too lax in applying the law; the groups say that that is outrageous.

Minority protection guaranteed
</H1>
Germany has ratified the Agreement on the Protection of Minorities,
making it the tenth member of the European Council to do so. The
corresponding document was presented to the Secretary General of the
Council in Strasbourg. Germany thus pledges to protect minorities living
within its national borders, such as Frisians and Danes, against
discrimination. Ethnic groups, such as gypsies, are also guaranteed the
promotion of their language and culture in public life. The prerequisite
for such protection, however, is that those affected have German
citizenship.
The European Convention comes into effect when twelve countries have
ratified it.

Recall action on contaminated pop cans
</H1>
Several pop cans contaminated with solvent may have been shipped
throughout the country. The cans, imprinted with the letters "RE" and a
two-digit number on the opening tab, are contaminated with the solvent
tri-chlor-anisol. The concentration of the solvent in the cans is not
supposed to be dangerous, but it is enough to give a bad aftertaste to
Coke, Sprite, Mezzo-Mix, and Bonaqua. Coca-Cola is taking back the
contaminated cans in a country-wide recall, and will dispose of them.
Purchasers of those drinks are asked to return cans imprinted with "RE" to
the nearest grocery store.
According to the company, all the stores which received the contaminated
cans have been traced and the drinks replaced with new orders.
