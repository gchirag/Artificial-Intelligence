Prediction that unemployment numbers will drop in 1999
</H1>
In the opinion of leading economic research institutes,
unemployment numbers in Germany will drop noticeably in the coming year. A
poll by the Hamburg newspaper "Abendblatt" among the institutes showed that
they expect unemployment figures below four million. The researchers still
do not see reason for euphoria because in 1999 economic growth will be
significantly slower than this year. Prospects are not bright for the
winter semester in particular.

Businesses enter the New Year with skepticism
</H1>
The mood about the New Year is skeptical among German businesses.
The German Industry Institute said that disturbances in the world economy
as well as insecurity about the direction of new economic politics are
dampening the present mood as well as the expectations for 1999. Half of
the 42 branches of industry interviewed expect a further reduction of the
work force. Export oriented industries in particular view the economic
development more negatively than a year ago. In the building industry in
Western Germany, the four year downturn seems to be coming to an end,
although there are still no signs for an upswing.

Schroeder wants to take action against low taxes within the EU
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants to use Germany's time as
President of the European Union to take action against low taxes within the
European Union. Government Speaker Mr. Haie said that the introduction of
the Euro in the beginning of the year demands coordination in tax and
economic politics and that ruinous tax dumping has to stop. Furthermore, he
said that the fight against unemployment has to be coordinated within
Europe as a whole. Joschka Fischer, German Minister of the Exterior,
considers a structural reform of the EU the central responsibility of the
German presidentship. He said that the EU has to become a pan-European
union rather than limiting itself to being a confederation of the Western
European countries.

</H1>
A bitter fight about long distance calls within Germany was waged during
the Christmas holidays. Deutsche Telekom AG seems to have been able to
outlast most competitors. Telekom president Ron Sommer announced a price
reduction to as little as 6 Pfennig per minute for a long distance call
within Germany for the coming year. That is a price that is unrivaled in
the world. The date of commencement has not as yet been set, however. Mr.
Sommer said it is Telekom's goal to make Germany the world's leading
telecommunications nation. He also promised to improve service and make
Telekom the most customer-friendly branch of business in Germany. Mr.
Sommer criticized the government regulation authority because it allows
small businesses such as Mobilcom to offer extremely cheap rates using
Telekom's net.

Commissioner for the Armed Forces appeals to soldiers
</H1>
Mr. Marienfeld, the Commissioner for the Armed Forces in the
Bundestag (Lower House of parliament) has appealed to soldiers to more
rigorously report problems within the troops and misbehavior of
supervisors. In an interview, Mr. Marienfeld said that this is the only way
to solve problems quickly. Unfortunately, drafted soldiers often turn in
reports only after the end of their time of service. Mr. Marienfeld also
announced that the number of conscientious objectors has reached a new
high. The Ministry of Defense estimates the number of applications for
alternative service to be 170,000 this year. A possible explanation is the
continuing discussion about mandatory military service.
