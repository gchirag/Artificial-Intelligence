No concerns about privacy of patient-data
</H1>
The Federal Association of General Practioners refuted criticism of the
planned health reforms voiced by privacy advocates. Talking of severe
breaches of the Privacy Act was "way over the top", as president Hess said
in an interview with the newspaper OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. Collating and
centralising patient data at public health insurers was not meant for
spying on patients, but mainly for keeping doctors informed and under
control. The Health Ministry added that patients would stay anonymous.
No single patient's data would be available through a machine-readable
diagnosis-code

Privacy concerns about Registrars' data being used for party mail-outs
</H1>
Privacy concerns have been raised over the CDU's plans for mail-outs
in campaigns against government's plans to reform pensions.
Baden-Wuerttemberg State Privacy Commissioner Schneider said in Stuttgart that
there was no law providing access to peoples' data stored at the local
Registrar's.
Some towns and villages were unsure if they were allowed to give out
information to the CDU for this purpose. Minister for Internal Affairs
Schaeuble, however, said that they were allowed to do that prior to
elections. The Baden-Wuerttemberg local elections are scheduled for
14 October

Dioxin-contaminated animal feed also in Bavaria and North-Rhine/Westphalia
</H1>
The authorities in Bavaria and North-Rhine/Westphalia followed suit: after
Baden-Wuerttemberg they also detected dioxin-contaminated animal feed.
That was caused by clay from contaminated clay-pits in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Clay serves as filler in the manufacture of animal feed. According to AP,
at least 23 manufacturers in Germany had bought contaminated clay, as well
as some in Switzerland and Austria. Bavarian and Swiss authorities, however,
stated unanimously that there were no health concerns for consumers.

SPD: amend law on 630-mark jobs
</H1>
The SPD parliamentary group wants the law on 630-marks jobs amended,
according to their manager Schmidt (sp?), and they want to push changes
through, even if Finance Minister Eichel was against them, according to the
newspaper BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG. The tax-free allowance for work at
sports-clubs would have to go up, and would have to get extended to cover
all community-service activities. Head of the Association of Taxpayers Daeke
also asked for amendments. According to a survey of almost 1000 small
businesses, 25% of all workers had lost or given up their mini-jobs.

Shareholders agree to new pharmaceutical giant Aventis
</H1>
The shareholders of Hoechst AG cleared the way for a new pharmaceutical
giant, viz. Aventis. 99.73% of them voted for an amalgamation with the
French company Rhone-Poulenc. The debate preceding the vote lasted 19 hours,
quite unexpectedly long. A small group of shareholders had tried to delay
the vote by asking more and more questions. The new company will have a
turnover of 34.5 billion marks, employ 92,000 staff and move their head
office to Strasbourg/France.

EU-Commissioner for Competition wants to take on German Post AG
</H1>
Outgoing EU-Commissioner for Competition van Miert will take Germany to court
for unlawful subsidies by German Post AG. The EU-Commission is to vote on
the matter on Wednesday. Apparently he was reacting to a complaint by parcel
service UPS, who had claimed that German Post AG, losing money on parcels yet
making a profit on letters, cross-subsidised their parcel service. German
Post AG said that they were quite relaxed about the matter. The Commission
had had a go at them for the last five years. Cases dealing with
anti-competitive behaviour as well as paying subsidies had all been thrown
out by the courts.
