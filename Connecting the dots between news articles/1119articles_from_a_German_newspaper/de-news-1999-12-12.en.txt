Nazi slave labour: increased offer denied
</H1>
Representatives for the fund set up by German companies have
denied reports that the German offer to former Nazi slave labours would
be increased. A spokesman said that he knew nothing about allegations
that American firms would be stocking up the fund. The "Welt am Sonntag"
newspaper reports that two billion Deutsche Mark would be added to the
eight billion Mark fund. The money is apparently supposed to be come from
American firms who have subsidiaries in Germany.

"Alliance for Work" talks in Berlin
</H1>
Representatives of government, industry and labour unions met in Berlin
on Sunday afternoon for the fourth round of "Alliance for Work" talks.
Retirement at the age of 60 remains a contentious issue. The Union for
Metal, Engineering and Electronics is still insisting on this being
implemented and have demanded that Chancellor Schroeder intervene. Mr.
Henkel, president of the representatives for German Industry, has
categorically rejected retirement at 60 because it apparently cannot be
financed.

<P>
The talks ended in the evening without any concrete results. A further
round of talks has therefore been planned for December 23rd where the
retirement issue will be discussed once more before the next round of
wage negations scheduled for January next year. Employers want to propose
that premature retirement be a voluntary point in the various tariff
agreements.

<P>
However, delegates at the talks had reached agreement as regards a pilot
project for the state subsided low-wage sector. The government will thus
contribute to social security contributions for these jobs in the future
up to a wage of DM 1600. German industry agreed in return to create more
apprenticeship positions. The government has agreed to concentrate their
two-billion Marks plan for reducing youth unemployment in more
undeveloped areas of Germany.

CDU leadership continues to support Kohl
</H1>
The CDU leadership is continuing its supported of their honorary
chairman, Helmut Kohl. Wolfgang Schaeuble, current leader of the CDU,
said at the meeting of the party council in Berlin that the accusations
against Kohl were absurd. A spokesman announced that Kohl would not be at
the CDU regional party conference taking place in Berlin on Monday. The
TV Programme "Focus-TV" had reported over the weekend that 85 million
Deutsche Mark in bribes had been paid to German political parties at the
purchase of the East German Leuna refinery. Helmut Kohl, who had been
Chancellor of Germany at the time, is supposed to have known about this
transaction. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Bonn has brought charges
in ten cases against Kohl. It is however still not clear whether a board
of investigation will be constituted.

Criticism of EU resolution on the status of Turkey
</H1>
European experts of all the German political parties have
criticised the EU resolution that Turkey be accepted as a candidate for
the EU. They say that Turkey is far from being a democratic state, that
the economic conditions were far from satisfactory and that it was
unrealistic that Turkey would fulfil the conditions for being accepted in
the EU within the next ten years. Mr. Ecevit, the Turkish State Premier,
said at the closing of the EU summit that his country would become a
member of the EU much sooner than generally expected.
