Voscherau appeals to Bundestag for new drug programs
</H1>
Henning Voscherau, mayor of Hamburg, has urged Bundestag to permit
distribution of heroin for experimentation. It is estimated that in Hamburg
alone there are currently 10,000 mostly young heroin addicts. Although almost
every other junkie is under medical treatment, the remaining addicts cannot be
reached through conventional programs such as the distribution of methadone. The
mayor also considers the nationwide trend of increasing numbers of drug-related
deaths and people passing on to harder narcotics alarming. Heroin prescriptions
by doctors might bring a stop to the vicious circle of addiction, crime and
impoverization. Voscherau referred to Switzerland, where heroin has already been
dealt out to addicts. This has resulted in rapid health improvement among
junkies. Voscherau appealed therefore to the government to change the narcotics
law accordingly. Voscherau stated that the drug war has been lost a long time
ago.

</H1>
Minister of Employment Bluem introduced the report of the pension
commission. According to the report, by the year 2030 the pension level will be
decreased to 64 per cent of the average net income, currently being just below
70 per cent. The pension contributions will first be decreased and, after that,
be  raised to 22.9 per cent by the year 2030. The body rejected the raise of the
age limit, but a demographical factor will be added to the pension model. At the
same time, establishing a family fund is proposed. It is to finance
family-related benefits using tax revenues which so far have been drawn from the
pension funds. Bluem emphasized that the encumbrance would be reasonably shared
by young and old.

Commemoration of the victims of National Socialism
</H1>
Bundestag and Bundesrat honored the victims of National Socialism. 52
years ago today the prisoners were freed from the Auschwitz concentration camp.
The former mayor of Hamburg Klaus von Dohnanyi warned not to ignore the past. He
stated that "We cannot let it happen that here the Nazi reign and the Holocaust
will be locked away in buildings constructed from the names of the culprits and
the numbers of the victims. Every school that dedicates itself to only one
victim's fate from those years, districts and villages that give back a name and
a human face to only one of the tortured anonymous, can do more to maintain our
memory and thoughts than many hours of dull history classes." The head of the
parliament  Rita Suessmuth urged the German people to remember the crimes of the
Nazi era for the sake of a better future.

Autopsy to be performed on presumed Creutzfeld-Jakob victim
</H1>
An autopsy will be performed on the 41-year-old North Frisian who
presumably died of the Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Her relatives have approved the
procedure. The results of the examination will only be available in several
weeks, the Minister of Health in Schleswig-Holstein, Moser, stated.
<P>
The pathological examinations are supervised by experts from the University of
Goettingen and may take several weeks. Afterwards, the public will be informed
on the circumstances of the woman's death. Moser could not confirm claims that
she had spent an extended period of time in Great Britain in the past. Moser
also said that there were no indications hinting at a new form of
theCreutzfeld-Jakob disease. It is suspected that the new variant, which also
infects young people and is said to proceed much faster than the one only
occuring in older people, is caused by the same factors that cause the bovine
disease BSE. According to minister Moser, there is no need for political action
even if the North Frisian woman died of a new form of this rare disease.

Many foreign construction businesses pay below minimum wage
</H1>
Many foreign businesses pay wages below the legal minimum wage coming into
effect for the construction trade in January 1997. This was stated by the
Federal Labour Office in co-operation with the customs offices during a national
inspection. Of the 250 employers with foreign headquarters, 90 were suspected to
pay up to six marks per hour less than the minimum wage.
The minimum wage contract is supposed to protect the German construction
industry and prevent construction workers from other EU-countries from being
paid particularly low wages in Germany.

No jobs will be lost because of broadcasting merger in Southwest
</H1>
The planned fusion of broadcasting companies in the southwest will
cause no job losses, according to an estimate by State Premier Erwin Teufel.
Although it might lead to cuts due to technical progress in the media, Teufel
said on Westdeutscher Rundfunk, he did not believe that the planned fusion of
Sueddeutscher Rundfunk and Suedwestfunk would lead to job cuts. Teufel believes
that jobs could be cut in the administration, but because of the widening of the
program range, new jobs would be created. Opposing this view, the CDU party
leader in the Stuttgart state parliament, Guenther Oettinger (sp?) had stated in
December that the fusion would bring along a considerable reduction of jobs.
According to him, the new station would have to get along with less than 3.500
jobs and thus the current total employee figure of 4.270 would be decreased by
over 800 employees. With the saved money, programsshould be improved.
