Repercussions of Cuts in Subsidies for Coal Mining Industry
</H1>
The governmental savings plans regarding coal industry subsidies have
received strong reactions from all sides. The SPD canceled its
participation in the tax summit scheduled for today, thus making it
impossible to hold the event. The governing coalition sharply criticized
this action. CDU parliamentary group leader Schaeuble accused the Social
completely unrelated. Today, unions, employers, and politicians met in
Duesseldorf, to deliberate the current situation of coal mining workers in
the Ruhr and Saar regions, at a conference on coal policy, which had been
organized on short notice.
In a union-organized protest, more than five thousand coal miners
demonstrated outside the conference meeting place. The conference was
organized by prime minister Johannes Rau, who had invited the chair of the
union for metal, engineering and electronics, Hans Berger, the chair of
the union for chemical industries Hubertus Schmoldt, Minister of Economics
Wolfgang Clement, Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser, and the leader of the
Ruhr Coal Industries, Gerd Neipp, as well as several suppliers and the
mayors of the affected townships. However, it is questionable whether the
meeting at large will be able to reach a conclusion in its deliberations
of how the future of the coal mining industries is to be structured,
following the cuts of governmental subsidies. Prime Minister Rau
already made it clear yesterday that the state of North Rhine-Westphalia
was not able to increase its own coal subsidy budget of 1.2
billion Marks any further. Currently, all mines in the Ruhr and Saar
regions have suspended operation. Massive protests are expected to last
until at least Tuesday, when further coal industry deliberations are
scheduled at the Chancellor's office.

Reactions to SPD's Cancellation of Tax Talks
</H1>
The parliamentary group leader of the SPD, Struck, considers the
government's plan to reduce coal subsidies to be scandalous. In an
interview with the radio station "Deutschlandfunk," he defended his
party's decision not to participate in the third round of tax talks with
the governing coalition. Struck noted that the SPD refused to negotiate
about anything with people who were rigorously trying to reduce the number
of jobs in a given industry.
FDP parliamentary group leader Solms voiced his disappointment with the
SPD's decision. In an interview with the "Deutschlandfunk," he explained
that the government owed it to the tax payers to use their money as
economically as possible. Solms believed that no country could afford to
subsidize jobs to such a high degree as was the case in the coal industry.
The vice-chair of the CDU parliamentary group, Bergner, also criticized
the SPD action.

The DGB and the DAG express opposition to antisocial policies
</H1>
The German Federation of Unions (DGB) and the National Union of Employees
(DAG) expressed opposition to antisocial policies that give rise to the social
gap within the society. The DGB issued an appeal calling for women working in
factories and administrations to bring before the public their ideas of
solidarity and a worthwhile society in which to live. The DAG is demanding
equal wages for female employees. Mrs. Schulz, the head of the "Female
Employees" main department of the DAG's national board in Hamburg, criticized
the remaining unchanged difference between the wages of men and women. She
especially criticized the discrimination against women in the work force
resulting from the high unemployment rate in Eastern Germany.

Mr. Rauen: no alternative but spending cut
</H1>
The chairman of the CDU/CSU Middle-class Alliance, Mr. Rauen, reemphasized
that it is necessary to reduce the spending of the government. He said on the
radio station "DeutschlandRadio Berlin" that no other alternative than this
exists. He specifically demanded relief of excessive labor costs on
medium-sized and small businesses. At the same time employees should be able
to benefit from lower taxes and social contributions. This would automatically
lead to higher consumption.

Opening of the 49th International Trade Fair in Munich
</H1>
Today, the German Minister of Economics, Mr. Rexrodt, opened the 49th
International Trade Fair in Munich. Until March 16 more than 1,700 exhibitors
will participate in the world's biggest trade fair, featuring machines, tools,
as well as furnishings for small and medium-sized businesses. This year the
fair is important as a special indicator of the business cycle for
medium-sized and small businesses. The industry still lays claim to the image
that trade is the locomotive of the economic development. But the speed and
surety of this phenomenon are slightly less than before. Trade continues to be
the leading training sector. In Bavaria the number of new business contracts
increased for the sixth year in a row to 37,800 in 1996 . The high number
of 150,000 new Bavarian businesses is also welcome. The managing director of the
trade fair, Franz Reisbeck, stated that these tradesmen and their colleagues
will focus on information and communications technology this year. Because of
this there will be presentations entitled "Medialog" and "Trade up to Data",
where visitors get introduced to the technology and acquainted with computer
software for management. During special events craftsmen will show their
special talents by producing glass and providing baked goods as well as
pastries. The trip back on the MVV, the Munich transit system, is free, as all
fair admission tickets include the price of a return ticket.

National Congress of the Young Liberals opens
</H1>
The fourteenth federal congress of the Young Liberals began in Cologne. With
the motto "More rights for the individual, less State" the offshoot of the FDP
debated a whole range of current issues such as secret surveillance and the
legal certification of homosexual relationships. The congress began yesterday
evening with severe criticism of the mother party. According to Michael Kauch
the old, and as of yesterday for a third time in a row reelected federal leader
of the JuLis, the FDP exhibits too little liberal profile on issues such as
immigration policies. He strongly attacked the federal Justice Minister Edzard
Schmidt-Jartzig for the Minister's attitude in the matter of visa requirements
for foreign children. According to Kauch, the JuLis are demanding an immigration
law that encourages integration rather than exclusion. To this end foreigners
who are second or third generation residents of Germany should receive German
citizenship.

German Youth Aid Organization raises alarm
</H1>
The German Youth Aid Organization is raising alarm. According to an investigation by the organization, the criminality of children in the past five
years has climbed dramatically. Especially in eastern Germany the crimes of
minors sped into the heights. A look at the statistics of the Police offices
of the states' attorneys offices shows that since 1991 a continually climbing
number of children and youths appear on the indictment sheets. Throughout the
country the number of minor offenders has climbed since then by two thirds.
Developments in the new states are especially noteworthy. For example, in Dresden there was an 800 percent increase in the number of youthful defendents than
in 1991. Michael Kruse, speaker for the German Youth Aid Organization, lays
blame for the situation at the feet of the social change above all else. In the
west Bavaria has the highest rate of child crime increase at eighty percent. In
Kruse's opinion there are social causes for this nationwide development. He
credits the rapid climb in joblessness among parents, the steep climb in the
number of recipients of social help, and more importantly the lack of recreational opportunities for children. Moreover the pressure of the consumer
society increases constantly, that is to say that a portion are driven to criminality by the massive advertising in public spaces. The most common crime
committed by children is larceny. An increase in child punishment law is the
wrong solution for preventing child criminality, in the opinion of the Youth
Aid Organization. According to Kruse, a meaningful increase in youth employment
would not require a large financial investment. He said that more recreational
opportunities must be offered, and existing recreational centers playgrounds
for example, must be structured more for children. Beyond that, school grounds
must be open to children outside of school hours as well. The opportunity to
play sports at schoolyards must be offered as well. Large cities must also
establish Youth commissions and the assignment of young police officers as
contacts for the young.
