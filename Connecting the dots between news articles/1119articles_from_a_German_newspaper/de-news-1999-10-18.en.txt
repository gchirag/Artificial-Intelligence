Schroeder in favor of less bureaucracy for adoption of 630 DM law
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder once again ruled out changes to the
reorganization of the 630 DM jobs. However, Schroeder said at the
annual meeting of the National Association of German Newspaper
Publishers in Berlin he would welcome talks about reducing bureaucracy
for the adoption of the law.  The chancellor admitted that the
government's measures had gone too far with respect to the amendment
on fictitious self-employment. The proposed change intends to exempt
new business owners from paying social insurance contributions for a
certain period of time. The same applies to older persons who had
already gained entitlement.  The vice-president of the newspaper
publishers, Heinen, criticized the laws as doing away with jobs and
being counterproductive.

SPD adheres to capital levy
</H1>
The SPD leadership adheres to its plans on a capital levy. The
designated general secretary, Muentefering, said after a presidency
meeting in Berlin that he saw no reason for a change of plans. Large
assets should pay their contributions to modernizing the state and to
the consolidation of public authorities. Saxony's State Premier,
Biedenkopf, voiced his criticism.  The CDU politician said in a
newspaper interview that a capital levy
would create the impression that those well-off would not be welcome.

Expert commission demands extensive reform of the EU
</H1>
An expert commission charged with reforming the union suggested quick
and extensive steps. The former Prime Minister of Belgium, de Hane,
said at the introduction of the report in Brussels that the decisions
on the upcoming expansion of the EU should be taken before the end of
the year 2000. The accession of Eastern European countries should not
be delayed because of internal problems of the European Union.  Former
federal president von Weizsaecker and the former British trade
minister Simon developed the reform package next to De Hane. It is
intended to serve the EU commission as a basis for its debatte on the

Forum Ost wants to increase support of East Germans' interests
</H1>
The "Forum Ost" of the SPD wants to take a more critical issue with
the politics of the federal government in the future, as indicated by
the chairperson of the committee, Brandenburg's State Premier Stolpe,
in an interview with the newspaper "Maerkische Oderzeitung". So far,
the forum had voiced the demands of the East German population
insufficiently.  The people did no longer trust the SPD in East
Germany to take their needs into consideration.  For this reason, the
Forum would more strongly voice questions such as matching salaries
between East and West.
