Germany and France jointly propose EU changes
</H1>
Germany and France intend to introduce a number of joint proposals to
the current negotiations about a reform of the European Union. Foreign
ministers Kinkel and de Charette named the extension of the commission
president's authority, among others; however, after the expansion of
the Union not every country will be entitled to a commission member
anymore.

<P>
The French and German foreign ministers also presented a proposal
regarding the controversial question of the voting procedure. They
suggested that so-called strategic decisions should continue to be
subjected to the principle of unanimity, but that the realization of
such decisions could be handled with a qualified majority.

<P>

against wanting to increase cooperation within the EU without the
approval of all EU member countries.

Nuclear waste transport halted
</H1>
The Castor nuclear transport to the freight station in
Dannenberg (Lower Saxony) was delayed by numerous protest activities.
Demonstrators temporarily stopped the train near Goettingen. In
Dannenberg, the train's final destination, several thousand nuclear
protesters have already gathered.

<P>
It is also unclear whether the schedule for the transport to the
Gorleben temporary storage site can be kept. The two main access roads
had to be blocked off after the ground underneath the roadways had been
hollowed out in several places. According to the district government,
the roads are no longer safe, meaning that the storage site is not
accessible anymore. 
<P>
Originally, the six nuclear waste containers were
scheduled to be transferred to trucks on Tuesday and then transported
to Gorleben on Wednesday.

Prokop: Wall victim's bleeding to death could not be prevented
</H1>
According to a GDR autopsy report that had initially been believed to
be lost, the East German refugee Peter Fechter would not have survived
even with immediate medical assistance. At the beginning of the trial
in the Berlin state court regarding Fechter's death following an
attempted escape over the Berlin wall in August 1962, the former head
of forensic pathology at the East Berlin Charite hospital, Prokop,
explained that a shot injured the 18-year old Fechter so severely that
it would have been impossible to prevent his bleeding to death. Until
now, investigators had assumed that Fechter died because the border
guards left him in the mine strip for 50 minutes before rescuing him.
<P>
Both defendants have admitted to shooting in the direction of the
fleeing man but deny any intent to kill.

</H1>
According to the chairman of the federal employees' agency (BfA),
Richard, old age pensions in Eastern Germany will be raised by an
estimated 6.02 percent in mid-1997. Richard said in Berlin that
pensions in the West would probably go up 1.6 percent. Because of the
bad job market, premiums for pension insurance should rise to 20.2
percent in 1998 and 1999.

EU intends to lower emissions but disagrees on procedure
</H1>
The European Union's ministers of the environment have
formulated a joint goal for the December world climate summit in
Kyoto/Japan. The 15 member countries intend to achieve a 15 percent
decrease in the emissions of greenhouse substances by the year 2010.
The realization of this plan is considered doubtful because the
countries cannot agree on their individual contributions to the
protection of the world climate.
