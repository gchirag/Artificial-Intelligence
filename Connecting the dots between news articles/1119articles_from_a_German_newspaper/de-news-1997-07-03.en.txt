Kohl and Minister Presidents discuss apprenticeship positions
</H1>
The Minister Presidents of the States have consulted with Chancellor Kohl
on the issue of a shortfall in apprenticeship positions.  The Chancellor
favors eliminating the second day of school per week.  [Translator's note:
In the German dual system of vocational training, apprentices are required
to attend a professional school on two days per week while receiving
on-the-job training at a company during the remaining days.] The Minister
Presidents addressed the Chancellor without a uniform plan of action.
Hamburg's mayor, Mr. Voscherau (SPD), noted that differing ideas are
circulating, as to how the apprenticeship crisis should be combatted.
His Bremen counterpart and fellow party member Mr. Scherf, as well as the
Bavarian Premier, Mr. Stoiber (CSU), called for a flexible solution.  The
majority of the States, however, oppose the elimination of the second
weekly day at professional school.  By insisting on this proposal, the
federal government hopes to stimulate the economy to create more
apprentice slots.  The Heads of Government called on the bargaining
parties to establish verifiable rules to increase the number of
apprenticeship offers.  In addition, the Federal and State Governments
pledged to streamline the administrative procedures involved in the
creation of new professions and in the declaration of educational guidelines.

German Governments reject accusations by Amnesty International
</H1>
The Federal and State Governments have rejected accusations by Amnesty
International against the German police.  The human rights organization
has branded German police officers as being particularly harsh in their
treatment of foreigners.  Federal Interior Minister, Mr. Kanther said that
the accusations by Amnesty do not correspond to reality, for the German
police are not hostile towards foreigners.  In individual cases of
officers acting inappropriately, the Public Prosecutor's Office and
independent courts will investigate these with due rigor, Mr. Kanther
said in a joint statement with the chairman of the conference of the
State Interior Ministers, Mr. Jaeger (CDU).  The police union is even
considering litigation against the human rights organization.

several hurdles to overcome.  Countering rumors, the German Foreign Minister
emphasized that Germany and France do agree on the fundamental questions.
This particularly holds for the Euro.  During the morning, Mr. Vedrine
also met with Chancellor Kohl.

Schroeder and Griefhahn criticize change in nuclear power law
</H1>
The Lower-Saxon Minister President, Mr. Schroeder, has accused the Federal
Government of blocking energy policy.  This was Schroeder's reaction,
published in the newspaper "Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung", to an announcement
by Environmental Minister Ms. Merkel that controversial changes in the
regulations on nuclear power may be pushed through parliament even without
the consensus of the SPD.  The SPD negotiator at the energy talks stressed
that without a change of power in Bonn there would be no progress.  On
Deutschlandfunk radio, State Environmental Minister Ms. Griefhahn spoke of
an affront.  She added that Ms. Merkel's move had destroyed the basis for
further talks.  Yesterday, Ms. Merkel presented a revision of the nuclear
power law that does not require approval by the Bundesrat.  The change
includes safety test protocols for new reactor types.
