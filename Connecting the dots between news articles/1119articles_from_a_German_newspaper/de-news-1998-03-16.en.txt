Toepfer wants to pay back compensation
</H1>
The former minister of construction, Toepfer, wants to pay back 500,000
DEM to the federal government. He received the compensation for his move
to a position with the UN. The CDU politician said in Bonn that this was
his personal decision and that did not change the legality of this
payment.
Opposing this view, the parliamentary secretary-general of the SPD-
faction in the Bundestag, Struck, announced that the procedure did not
comply with budget regulations. The payment was intended to compensate
for income losses resulting from Toepfer's new job as an executive
director of the UN's environmental organization in Nairobi. The money
was paid out of the budget of the Foreign Ministry. Its speaker
confirmed that over the past years two high-ranking German officials had
received a combined total of about one million DEM for their move to the
UN.

SPD party platform economically orientated
</H1>

platform for the elections will be the most market-economy orientated
one in history. The goals were the fight against unemployment and
fundamental reforms of the economy, government, and society, Schroeder
said after the SPD party council passed the platform in Bonn. If the SPD
won the elections, a social-democratic government would make corrections
to the restrictions of sick pay decided by the current government. The
paper also promised to revoke the unsocial pension reduction.

Schroeder criticises demands for Rau's resignation

improper treatment of such an esteemed person. Rau himself seemed to be
unimpressed by the whole debate while taking part in the meeting of the
SPD executive board. He said that he had his own schedule and that he
wanted to act according to it.

Catholic Church: no co-responsibility for Holocaust
</H1>
In the Vatican's opinion, the Catholic Church bears no co-responsibility
for the Nazi genocide of the Jewish population. According to a
declaration of the papal commission for relations to the Jews, the
unspeakable tragedy of the holocaust had its roots outside of
Christianity. However, Christians would have to face the reproach that
they had not done everything humanly possible to save persecuted Jews.
The Catholic Church asked for forgiveness for the mistakes of its
followers.
Israel's high rabbi, Lau, demanded a clear apology from the Vatican for
the lack of resistance against the Nazi mass murder. The declaration
published today only referred to the attitude of the Catholic Church to
the persecution of Jews in general. In Lau's opinion, an open
condemnation could have prevented terrible events during World War II.
