Germany requests extradition of Priebke
</H1>
Bernhard Boehm, spokesman for the German Justice Ministry, said Germany
will request the extradition of former SS-member Erich Priebke. The 40-day
time limit would not put German justice under any time stress because an
arrest warrant has been issued for a long time. "The prosecutor in Dortmund
assumes that they have sufficient evidence to try Mr. Priebke. I may also
point out that there is an arrest warrant. That means, the evidence has
already been sufficient for a judge to issue an arrest warrant. I may also
point out that the accusation is murder, an offence for which the German
criminal code stipulates life imprisonment." Already last year German
authorities have sought Argentina to extradite Priebke. According to
international custom Germany has now requested Priebke's transmission from
Italy to Germany. According to Boehme, it is the Italian Justice that is
under time pressure now. Once the sentence has become final, it would be
difficult to extradite Priebke because he could not be tried twice for the
same offence by legal principles.

Wage dispute in retail sector
</H1>
In the retail sector, warning strikes have been broadened by the National
Union of Employees and the Trade, Banking, and Insurance Employees' Union.
This time, large department stores have also been affected by the
industrial action. In Mainz, the employers put an offer on the table for
the first time: a supplement of 18 percent in compensation for work time
outside normal working hours when shops can be open longer starting this
autumn. The unions are demanding 55 percent. An agreement seems unlikely
for the moment.

According to a study by U.S. space agency NASA, the exposure to UVB
radiation, which is particularly dangerous, has increased by almost 7% in
Germany during the past ten years. The reason for the rise is said to be
the declining size of the protective ozone layer. The radiation is thought
to increase the risk for, amongst others, skin cancer and for developing a
cataract.
