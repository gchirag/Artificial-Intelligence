EU countries to send ambassadors to Iran again
</H1>
According to an agreement of the Foreign Ministers of the EU
countries, the ambassadors of most of the meber countries are to return
to Iran over the next few days. The diplomats were ordered back in
reaction to the verdict in the Mykonos trial.

<P>
In the current, highly problematic situation of the relations between the
European Union and Iran, having an ambassador present is important, an
official said. He also indicated that some member countries had pressed
to send their representatives back to Tehran before the conference of
Foreign Ministers in Luxemburg. However, the majority of EU governments
rejected this proposal, considering it to send the wrong signal, the
diplomat continued. Contrary to reports from Tehran, the EU is not to
reestablish the critical dialogue; this became known in the preliminary
stages of the Foreign Minister meeting. Officially, the member countries
of the European Union broke off the critical dialogue after the Mykonos
verdict in Berlin. The judges consider the responsibility of Iranian
politicians for the murder of four opposition Kurds as established.

Discussion about land reform rejected by eastern ministers of justice
</H1>

of the land reform in eastern Germany. After a meeting in Weimar they

in this matter. The Federal Constitutional Court has already dismissed
two suits filed by former owners of land in the area.
