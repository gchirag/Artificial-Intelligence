</H1>
One day after the SPD, also CDU/CSU announced a harder approach in fighting
crime. CDU/CSU presented today in Munich their election platform concerning
the interior security. The platform stipulates that the maximum penalty for
youths be raised from ten to fifteen years. Young adults under 21 will be
subjected more often to the adult penal code. The Union parties also
stipulate that criminal foreigners be expelled quickly. Genes of repeated
offenders shall be registered in a federal database and video surveillance
of residences shall be permitted. At the presentation, CSU leader Theo
Waigel criticized corresponding concepts of the SPD. They were a turn-about
and not credible, especially regarding the youth crime. The police unions
also criticized the SPD platform. It was understandable but putting it into
practice was doubtful.

In the so called Mehmet-case, the Munich Administrative Court has confirmed
the expulsion of the 14-year-old serial offender and his parents. The
expulsion writ issued by the City of Munich was legal. The special
protection of minors was not applicable here because the parents were
expelled together with the youth.
The 14-year-old called "Mehmet" had committed more than 60 crimes and is
currently held for investigation of a robbery. The Munich authorities
accuse his parents to have failed in his education and therefore the
parents are expelled along with their son.
