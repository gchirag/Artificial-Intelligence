After the Biescas tragedy
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl deeply regrets the tragedy on the campground at
Biescas/Spain, and he sent his condolences to Spain's Prime Minister,
whereas the German President, Mr Herzog, did the same for King Juan Carlos.
The European Union possibly will send aid immediately, and are looking into
requests by government and the Spanish Red Cross. It is still unknown how
many people died. The Aragon district council had mentioned 70 casualties;
at the time of the accident, however, more than 700 people had been
holidaying there, and they have not been accounted for. Heavy rain had
triggered a slip and covered the area within minutes.

Chancellor Kohl on raising goods and services tax and scrapping surtax
</H1>
According to Chancellor Kohl goods and services tax (Mehrwertsteuer) is to
go up after the federal elections. He said that he was not after filling
Treasury's coffers, but wanted the tax-burden shared more equally. The
difference between direct and indirect taxes had become to big over the
years. He also said that he thought that the re-unification surtax
(Solidaritaetszuschlag) would go until the year 2000, and this should be
an issue for the big general tax-reform.

Mr Hintze: government to simplify tax-system
</H1>
The General Secretary of the CDU-party, Mr Hinze, stated that the Bonn
government wanted to simplify the tax-system. He said on radio that the
goods and services tax (Mehrwertsteuer) was not to go up until 1999, and
that was final. Reforming the tax-system would be dependent on plans for
growth and more employment. He did not rule out that subsidies would be
scrapped.

Bavaria comes up with model for tax-reform
</H1>
Bavaria is the first federal state to come up with a plan for income-tax
reform, resulting in 30 billion marks less tax. Raising goods and services
tax (Mehrwertsteuer) would depend on how subsidies and exemptions were cut
back. From 1999 on there should be a linear progressive tax-rate. Single
income earners would not pay any tax on the first 13,095 marks, and then
20%. The tax-rate for incomes of 150,000 marks and more is to be 40%.
According to Bavaria's Finance Minister, Mr Erwin Huber, this would mean
that all taxpayers would pay more than a quarter less tax than at present.
He also was against lowering tax-rates for the rich only. Cutting subsidies
and exemptions and saving money would require a smaller rise of the goods
and services tax (Mehrwertsteuer). Company tax on unpaid profits is to go
down to 40% as well. Mr Huber also plans a withholding tax for interest
payments similar to what happens in Austria.

CDU presents programme to boost number of apprenticeships
</H1>
The CDU-party has published their 10-item programme intended to boost
the number of apprenticeships, making training more flexible and less
expensive. They hope that if employers' costs are lowered, they can also
train more young people. The CDU is against a global cut to apprentices'
pay. Training should become better, and trainees should spend more time at
work than at school.
The young members of the SPD-party, however, are for penalising companies
who do not train apprentices. The CDU-party is against penalties, as
companies would then pay the fee and offer less apprenticeships.

Mr Rexrodt speaks out against conditions tied to orders in public sector

Mr Rexrodt, Federal Economics Minister, has spoken out against conditions
tied to public sector orders. Saving money and being efficient should be the
prime objective. The FDP-politician was reacting to an idea, brought forward
by Bavaria and other states, to only buy from construction companies who
paid award rates and did not employ alien workers at rock-bottom wages.

Retail workers to strike all over Germany
</H1>
In case employers reject Rhineland-Palatinate's settlement of
the retail-workers' award, there are to be strikes all over Germany.
Ms Franziska Wiethold, of the union, said on radio that settling
below what had been agreed in Rhineland-Palatinate, would be unacceptable.
She would, however, agree to regional exceptions. The Rhineland-Palatinate
award provides for a 20% higher pay-rate if staff work after-hours and on
Saturdays. Bavarian retailers do not want this award, and the union has
already called for wide-spread strike-action there.

Union wants resumption of talks on compact for work
</H1>
Contrary to the Metalworkers' Union (IG-Metall), the Employees' Union (DAG)
thinks that the talks about a compact for work with Chancellor Kohl could be
resumed this autumn. When interviewed by the newspaper NEUE OSNABRUECKER
ZEITUNG, he said that government, employers and unions should talk to each
other once again, in order to turn the employment situation around. The
talks would be conditional on the employers showing some flexibility and,
first of all, keeping their promise to create more apprenticeships. And
government not delay and explain when and how they intended to lower
additional labour costs.

Bavaria's Alliance 90/Greens' party spokesperson resigns

Mr Kurt Heimann, spokesperson for the head of the political party Alliance
90/Greens in Bavaria, has resigned due to private financial problems.
He told the press that Ms Barbara Hoffmann, who was on the same party
hierarchy level, would do the same in November.
Party officials said that Mr Heimann's resignation meant a regrettable loss
to the party, but was the decent thing to do. Mr Heimann did neither want a
conflict of interests nor give less than his best, and he also wanted to see
more of his family as well as look after his health.

EU protest against US-law on sanctions
</H1>
The European Union voiced its official protest against
the recent US-law about sanctions. The law contains worldwide penalties
for companies investing in Lybia and Iraq. This prompted a first
reaction by a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, stating that the law
would grant the US-President a certain amount of discretion, being able to
waive sanction against companies in certain cases. He also said that the
European policy of critical dialogue did fail; emphasising, however, that
the United States wanted Europe to take stronger measures against Teheran.
If that was the case, Europe and the US could meet halfway.

According to the newspaper DIE WELT, Mr Vogel, head of

arrested, just like a member of the board of directors of the
Thyssen-Handelsunion. The managers had been released on bail immediately
after having been arrested. They are alleged to have defrauded the federal
government to the tune of 73 million marks, while winding down former East
German export company Metallurgie (during the re-unification of the two
Germanys).

US criticise Germany's treatment of the Scientology sect
</H1>
The United States criticised Germany's way of treating the
Scientology sect. A spokesperson said Washington was concerned about the
discrimination against the sect in Germany, and government had been asked to
look into the matter. The US Foreign Minister was following up a complaint
by several members of Congress, who had complained about the call for a
boycott of the US-movie "Mission impossible", starring Tom Cruise
(who is a Scientology member).
German courts of law and experts on sects think that Scientology is an
organisation who pretends to be a religious gathering, though they are
mainly into economic and power politics, and in the long run could
endanger the democratic system.

Costa Rica wants an explanation from Ms Nicola Fleuchaus
</H1>
San Jose. Costa Rica's government has asked Nicola Fleuchaus and Regula
Sigfried for an explanation about the relations they had with their
kidnappers. Apparently there are rumours the kidnapping was faked, based
on pictures showing Nicola Fleuchaus and the boss of the kidnappers rather
close to each other. Regula Siegfried, however, stated that as early as
in the second week of their kidnapping, romance had been in the air
between Nicola Fleuchaus and kidnapper Julio Cesar Vega, though there was no
question of a fake kidnapping. Both ladies had been kidnapped from a hotel
on New Year's Day, and released in March after 71 days in captivity.

For more than four decades the State Security Services (STASI) of
former East Germany employed at least 20,000 in-official helpers in
West Germany. Mr Busse, director of the agency looking into this matter
(Gauck-Behoerde), said that their cover would be blown and they might be
taken to court, when interviewed on radio Sueddeutscher Rundfunk. The
perpetrators had spied on border-guards (Bundesgrenzschutz) and the Armed
Forces. And they also had spied on groups with ties to East Germany's Civil

Maxhuette has not paid back loan
</H1>
Maxhuette Stahlwerke GmbH Sulzbach-Rosenberg, a foundry, has not paid back a
loan of 74 million marks. They were lent the money by the state of Bavaria,
in breach of a ruling by the European Union's Commission. There will have to
be deadlines now, but the company is under no immediate threat as lawsuits
may take up to a couple of years, according to Bavaria's Economics Minister,
Mr Wiesheu. And Mr Wiesheu is glad there is another row brewing between
Saxony and Brussels about the subsidies paid to a Volkswagen plant in former
East Germany. He said he could understand Saxony's attitude quite well. The
row would trigger an over-due discussion on the (federal) states' own
economic decisions.

re-structuring of the development programme, plus delays caused by the
partner governments. The Eurofighter is a joint venture between Great
Britain, Germany, Spain and Italy.

Ariane IV - mission successful
</H1>
Ariane IV took off from the European Space Centre at Kouru in French
Guyana, without any mishaps and on time. After about 20 minutes' flight its
freight - one Italian and one French communications satellite - was put into
orbit. At the beginning of this week, the take-off had been postponed for 24
hours, for technical reasons, but there were no hitches last night, and a
spokesperson said that it had been a total success, the satellites having
been released on the dot and precisely as planned. There are plans for four
more Ariane IV missions until the end of the year, bringing this year's
total to 18. Ariane V, a more powerful version, will be able to do its first
test-flight not until next spring. The first Ariane V had exploded while on
its first flight, shortly after take-off, due to a software problem in the
navigation system.
