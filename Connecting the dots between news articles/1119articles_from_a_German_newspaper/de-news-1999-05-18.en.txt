Germany will not participate in oil embargo against Yugoslavia
</H1>
Germany will not send any armed forces to stop ships delivering oil
to Yugoslavia. A foreign ministry spokesperson said the action was not
covered by international law. Even though Germany had endorsed the blockade
in the NATO Council, it nonetheless made its reservations known. There was
no general state of war between the NATO countries and Yugoslavia but a
limited military action. The state of war is a legal prerequisite for
Germany to participate in the blockade.

</H1>
Buendnis90/Gruene are working for a Bundestag resolution supporting a
NATO truce in Kosovo. The head of the party's faction in the lower house of
parliament Kerstin Mueller announced that the party would make a motion to
that effect in two weeks from now. The motion would be discussed with the
coalition partner, the Social-Democrats. The Green's motion aims at
securing the humanitarian aid for the refugees, which can only be achieved
by a longer truce by NATO. Mueller said further that the resolution was to
be a signal for Russia.

Schroeder visits air force base Piacenza
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder visiting the air force base
Piacenza in northern Italy has acknowledged the action of German soldiers
in the Kosovo war. Schroeder talked with Tornado pilots about the military
situation and was informed about their sorties. Schroeder said he was
convinced that the soldiers accepted the air war against Yugoslavia as
meaningful. This was Schroeder's first visit of a Bundeswehr unit.
Earlier, during a meeting with Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema,
Schroeder voiced reservations about Italy's peace plan for the Kosovo.
Schroeder definitely rejected the deployment of German ground troops.
D'Alema had suggested to suspend the NATO air strikes to involve Russia and
China in a UN resolution.

FDP need not pay back controversial party subsidy for now
</H1>
The FDP does not have to pay back the controversial 12.4 million
DM party subsidy paid by the German governments [to all parties with more
than 2% of the votes in relation to the number of votes]. The Higher
Regional Administrative Court in Muenster partly rejected the claims of
three smaller parties. The claimants only had a right to a total of about
300'000 DM that they had lost due to a formal error by the FDP when it
applied for the subsidy in 1996. The other parties did not have the right
to challenge the payment of the total sum paid to the FDP. Whether the FDP
has to pay back the remaining 12.4m DM was up to the administration of the
Bundestag. The court's ruling is revoking a ruling by a lower court
according to which the money would have had to be paid back immediately.

Increasing opposition against cost-cutting plans Eichel
</H1>
There is growing opposition on the side of the SPD and the Greens
against the planned budget cuts of finance minister Eichel.
Parliamentary Greens spokesperson on budgetary policy Metzger, said on
German television that saving 30 billion DM is asking too much.
Approximately half that amount would be feasible. The SPD (Social
Democrats) ministers Bergmann and Buhlmahn and Greens minister Fischer
also criticize Eichel's plans. In their opinion it would be politically
incorrect to cut all budgets by a fixed percentage. Eichel demands that
all ministries cut their budgets by 7.4 percent. That would add up to
approximately 30 billion DM. The budget for the year 2003 is to be cut
back by 50 billion DM.

Education and Science Union: no return to the 60s'educational system
</H1>
The Union for Education and Science has warned the country
against a conservative step back in educational policy. At the labour
union conference in Wuerzburg GEW-chairman Stange said that her
organization would actively resist a return of the Gymnasium (grammar
school) of the sixties and the introduction of centralized
school-leaving exams. They do not lead towards the future. Stange
criticizes finance minister Eichel's intention to cut down on education
and research in next year's budget. Qualified education and research are
the key to the fight against unemployment and to securing Germany's
position.

CEB urges EU-countries to save more
</H1>
The Central European Bank (CEB) accuses the EU-countries of
saving too little. According to the May report of the CEB, the
countries concerned pay too little attention to decreasing debts and and
balancing their budgets. Apparently the biggest problem is that these
countries barely anticipate on future expenses. The CEB is counting on
ever increasing expenditures on the sick and elderly. Pension and health
expenditures in the Euro monetary bloc will increase to approximately 7
percent of the gross national product by the year 2030.
