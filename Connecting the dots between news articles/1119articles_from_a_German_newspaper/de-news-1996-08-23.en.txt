Federal prosecutor might investigate against Iran's head of state
</H1>
The federal prosecutor will possibly try and take Iran's head of state, Mr
Rafsandschani, and religious leader, Mr Chamenei, to court for murder of
four Iranian dissidents in the Berlin restaurant Mykonos. A spokes-person for
the prosecution said that Iran's ex-president, Mr Banisadre's, testimony
at the Mykonos trial in September 1992 had been extremely precise. Apart
from the initial suspicion, now it would be paramount to check if the two
suspects would be able to be prosecuted - due their diplomatic immunity.
According to Mr Banisadre, Mr Chamenei had given written confirmation of the
order to attack. Mr Banisadre emphasised that he had no proof yet, but his
source had always been reliable in the past, and according to them, Mr
Rafsandschani had also given his okay. The spokes-person also refuted the
allegation, raised by Mr Banisadre, that Bonn's co-ordinator of secret
services, Mr Schmidtbauer, had agreed to release the accused soon after
sentencing, and said this was an absurd statement.

Tiff between European Union and Saxony heats up
</H1>
The tiff between the European Union and the state of Saxony (about
subsidies), heated up, and today's meeting between German Economics Minister
Rexrodt and EU-Commissioner van Mierdt in Brussels, did not solve the
conflict either. Saxony announced that they would take the European
Commission to court, i.e. the European Court in Luxembourg, and according
to Mr Rexrodt, the federal government was more than likely to second that
move. The discussion is about 91 million marks in subsidies Saxony paid to
Volkswagen, without first asking the EU-Commission. The moneys were for
two Volkswagen plants in Saxony.

New compromise in construction industry
</H1>
Frankfurt on Main. Bargaining agents for the construction industry hammered
out a new compromise on minimum wages for sites in Germany, viz. 17
marks/hour in West, and 15.64 marks in East Germany. The rates are
substantially lower than the ones agreed to in April (yet subsequently
cancelled by the employers). In case the employers agree, the new award
will be settled as of October 1996. Minimum rates are meant to put a stop to
cheap foreign labour.

CDU/CSU coalition sticks with tax reform time-table
</H1>
The governing CDU/CSU parties will stick with the 1999 deadline, according
to Chancellor Kohl, and the important debate about taxes was not meant to be
a playground for exercises in raising one's popular profiles. This put paid
to their coalition partner's (the FDP's) idea, to reform part of the taxes a
year earlier. At the same time Chancellor Kohl confirmed that Goods and
Services Tax (VAT) would not go up during this legislative period.

Mr Struck has doubts about government's willingness/ability to compromise
</H1>
Mr Struck, manager of the SPD party, raised doubts about government's
willingness and ability for compromise, as far as the cost-cutting laws
were concerned. On radio Deutschlandfunk he said that mediation between
Lower and Upper Houses (Bundestag and Bundesrat) - and the Upper House's
consent was mandatory for certain laws - would fail. If government wanted
to pass all the laws not requiring Upper House (Bundesrat) consent, he could
not see a reason why the SPD should show they are ready to compromise in the
mediation committee. Mr Struck emphasised that his party would shoot down
the draft about cutting pay during public servants' sick-leave. They would be
unable to do likewise for employees, as in their case there was no legal
requirement for the Upper House's (Bundesrat) consent. He proposed to
postpone this section of the cost-cutting laws by half a year, and have
employers and employees come up with their own proposals by then.

Postbank takes Scientology to court
</H1>
Today litigation began at the Stuttgart Regional Court, and it
was the Scientology sect against German Postbank. German Postbank does not
want to do business with them any more, and had closed the organisation's
accounts as of 31 July. Their decision had been based on the freedom of
contract, guaranteed by Germany's constitution (Grundgesetz), granting them
the right to decide themselves who they wanted to do business with. The
successors to the former (state-owned) German Post Office
(Deutsche Bundespost) had been required by law, to open an account for
whoever wanted one until 1995. Postbank's head office in Bonn was
optimistic about the trial.

Sat.1 cuts off Ms Schreinemakers
</H1>
Last night TV-station Sat.1 interrupted Margarete Schreinemakers'
live talk-show. As soon as she had begun talking about her (private) spat
with German tax authorities, they cut her off switching to the news-desk
instead. Management said that having hosts talk about their personal
problems on shows they host, would be against the principles of journalism.
The controversy drew record audiences, according to media researchers up to
6 million viewers (equivalent to a factor of 14%).
