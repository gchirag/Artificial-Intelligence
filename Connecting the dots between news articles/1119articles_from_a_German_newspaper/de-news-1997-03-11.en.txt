Government cancels talks with unions
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has cancelled talks with the mining and energy union
scheduled for this afternoon because of continuing miners' protests.
Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Friedrich Bohl announced after a
coalition meeting this morning that the government will not negotiate in an
atmosphere of protests.
After the announcement some hundred miners entered the buffer-zone around
parliament where any protest is prohibited but left quickly. Later, miners
followed the request of union leader Berger at a rally that afternoon to
return home for the time being. It remains unclear what will happen on
Thursday.

CDU/CSU approve plans for health reform
</H1>
The CDU/CSU faction has today approved of Health Minister Horst Seehofer's
plans for the health reform in spite of all criticism. Starting July, the
patient's share of all medicament and health service costs will increase by
DM5 or 5 percent. The increase will return about DM5 billion for the public
health insurances. Patient shares will continue to rise automatically every
two years by a small amount. However, each time the public health
insurances increase the income-indexed contributions the share increase
will be substantial.
Two changes are not controversial: Physicians will be allowed to share
jobs, and patients who consult several physicians about the same illness
will have to pay for the second opinion. Health insurances may introduce
primary-physician systems where the family physician is paid extra for
co-ordinating his patient's treatment by specialists.
The draft by Health Minister Seehofer must be presented to the Bundestag by
21 March.

Parliamentary Ombudsman for the Armed Forces presents annual report
</H1>
In her annual report Parliamentary Ombudsman for the Armed Forces Claire
Marienfeld deplores supply bottlenecks in the Bundeswehr. Ms. Marienfeld
warned against a two-tier army. Only quick-response units for foreign
deployment are sufficiently supplied. All other units complained about a
lack of material and spare parts. In some units more than half the vehicles
are not ready for immediate use. Soldiers called the situation desolate.
Ms. Marienfeld mentioned an example where firework was used as training
ammunition. One education officer had a hand torn off when he ignited a
self-made explosive.
About 6300 soldiers, 400 more than last year, complained to the ombudsman.
Complaints about abuse and undue roughness increased. There was also a
slight increase of drug abuse. This year, however, there were no casualties.
Right-extremist tendencies in the Bundeswehr were no topic, as only 56
soldiers had been suspected.

Diverging expert opinions on Transrapid
</H1>
The Transrapid Planning Group and environmental protection association BUND
have presented two opposing expert opinions on the energy budget of the
controversial high-speed train Transrapid that is propelled at 400 km/h by
magnetic levitation technology. Both studies, however, agree that the
Transrapid will harm the environment more than Inter-City Express
high-speed trains on conventional tracks.
The study by BUND declared Transrapid a veritable waste of energy.
According to the study the Transrapid consumes three times as much energy
as the ICE. The study assumes the Transrapid travels at maximum speed which
is 200 km/h faster than the train.
The study by the Planning Group shows a completely different picture.
According to their study the Transrapid only uses 15 Watt-hours more than
the ICE when the comparison is based on power consumption per passenger and
kilometre.
Again, the Planning Group pointed out that the levitation train harms the
environment less than cars or planes while being faster than converntional
trains. The environmentalists demanded that the "train of madness" must be
stopped now.

Animal transport accident in Black Forest
</H1>
A lorry carrying more than 200 heifers had an accident in the Black Forest
near Hinterzarten. 120 of the 240 calves were killed in the accident. More
than half the surviving animals had to be killed on site to relieve them
from their pains.
The accident happened at around 7am. It took firemen and helping farmers
more than 2 hours to get dead and life heifers out of the three-storey
semi-truck. Police assume that due to high speed the transport missed a
steep down-slope curve into the Hoellental [Devil=B4s Valley] , skidded, and
capsized.
