CDU party conference concluded
</H1>
Delegates at the CDU (Christian-Democratic Union) party conference
concluded their meeting by passing a resolution on European policies. It
calls for a fundamental reform of the European institutions and a decrease
in German EU contribution. At the same time, it cautions against a socialist
centralism within the EU.  In his closing statement, CDU head Wolfgang
Schaeuble said the party was on the right track to become the determining
force in Germany again. At his first appearance as CSU-leader at the
CDU conference, Bavarian State Premier Edmund Stoiber said the Kosovo
conflict must not be allowed to conceal the fact that Red-Green has no
answers to the fundamental issues. Mr Stoiber does support the involvement
of the armed forces with the NATO offensive in Yugoslavia. A CDU/CSU-lead
government would not have acted differently on this issue, Mr Stoiber sayd.
He is in favour of a political solution to the conflict.

Spring report predicts economic 1.7 percent growth
</H1>
The war in Kosovo has as yet had little or no effect on the economy
in Germany and the rest of the world. This conclusion has been found by
the six leading economic research institutes at the presentation of their
spring report. They are counting on a 1.7 percent growth of the German
economy in 1999. The government had hitherto acted on the assumption of
it being 1.5 percent. Based on the report, the rate of (economic) recovery
will increase and unemployment will decrease noticeably in the coming year.
The government now faces the challenge of setting down a clear future tax
policy, as soon as humanly possible.

<P>
The government sees its policies confirmed by the spring report. The Minister
of Economy, Mr Mueller, believes the report demonstrates that conditions are
favourable for a better economy and a more relaxed labour market.
Spokespersons for the opposition, however,  describe the report as a damning
verdict on the government’s policy. In their opinion, the lower unemployment
rate only reflects some statistical effects.

Scharping: Expulsion of Kosovar-Albanians already in January
</H1>
The Serbian special police force apparently began its systematic
expulsion of Kosovar-Albanians far earlier than was hitherto assumed. These
allegations are founded on photographs displayed today by Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping in Bonn. The photographs show bodies of Kosovar-Albanians
next to members of the Serbian special police force. The photographs were
taken as far back as January by a German OSCE observer. The man is now under
psychological care.

<P>
Mr Scharping is expected to travel to Moscow on Wednesday to discuss the
Kosovo conflict with Russian government representatives. Mr Scharping says
the government is primarily interested in gaining Russian cooperation for
a swift resolution of the crisis. He will meet with the Foreign Minister,
Mr Ivanov and the Defense Minister, Mr Sergeyev.

Bundeswehr: Half of Serbian military infra-struture destroyed
</H1>
The Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) believe that half of the Serbian
military infra-structure has been destroyed by now. Bundeswehr's Chief
of Staff, Mr Kirchbach said that by now only very few aerial manoeuvres
are undertaken by the Serbs in the area. There are also signs of
petrol shortages in the Yugoslavian Army.

Green leaders agree on compromisse for Kosovo conflict
</H1>
The Green party council has found a compromise resolution on the
Kosovo conflict. It is hoped that this compromise will prevent a break
up of the party at the upcoming special party convention, thus also
saving the [red-green] coalition government. Although this compromise
resolution includes open critics of the NATO attacks, they are not
rejected fundamentally. Nor does this compromise resolution call for a
one-sided end of the actions. However, the party council vowes for a several
days hold of the air attacks.

Mr Goetzfried to have shot 500 people in the concentration camp of
Majdanek (Poland), and to have assisted in the murder of 17,000 people.
Mr Goetzfried rejected the charges on most accounts. He claims not to
have fired a single shot.
