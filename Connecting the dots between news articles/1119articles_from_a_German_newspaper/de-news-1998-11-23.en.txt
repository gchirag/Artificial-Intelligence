Still no German request for Oecalan's extradition
</H1>
The German Government sticks to its decision not to start a request
for Oecalan's extradition. The leader of the PKK is under house arrest
in Rome. According to government speaker Heye, Chancellor Schroeder
will discuss this topic next Friday with the Italian State Premier
Dalema in Bonn. In Rome, Dalema said that he expects a German request
for extradition. Today, the Turkish Defence Minister, Sesgin,
announced a complaint of his government to the NATO about the Italian
politic. The Turkish Government will appeal against the decision to
release Oecalan. Because the UEFA (European soccer association)
expects some riots, it postponed the match between Turin and Istanbul
by one week to next Wednesday.

There will be no voting about an extension of the UN Security Council
before autumn next year. This decided the plenary meeting of the

members. Since this discussion started more than four years ago,
Germany and Japan have been the most promising candidates for a
permanent seat in the Security Council. Both countries, together with
the USA, France and Great Britain, favour an end of this discussion as
