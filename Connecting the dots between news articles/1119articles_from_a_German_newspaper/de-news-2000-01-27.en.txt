Hessian CDU hid more money in slush funds than previously thought
</H1>
The Hessian CDU hid more money than the previously revealed 8
million DM in secret accounts in Switzerland. Accountants who have been
investigating the finances of the state party have determined that there
could be up to 20 million DM in Swiss accounts. The party's state leader and
State Premier Roland Koch stated this afternoon that the examiners had
discovered the account. In December 1983, a total of 19.2 million DM in cash
was withdrawn from the account at the Metallbank; 1.5 million DM was then
redeposited in a new account, also at the Metallbank. Koch said further that
he had spoken with former CDU state party chairman Manfred Kanther about the
discrepancy who also had no explanation for why the amount was more than the
8 million DM he had admitted to.

Committee investigating donation scandal sets order of witnesses
</H1>
The Bundestag committee investigating the CDU donation scandal
decided this afternoon when it will hear which witnesses.  The staff of the
Chancellor's Office will be questioned first about the disappearance of files
on the sale of the Leuna refinery. On March 16, former CDU finance adviser
Horst Weyrauch will testify. The SPD, the Greens and the PDS, which make up
the majority of the committee, made this decision against the wishes of
CDU/CSU representatives, who would rather have had former chancellor Helmut
Kohl as the first witness. The government's ruling parties (SPD and Greens)
insisted that Kohl testify later, since Kohl still refuses to divulge the
names of the donors and is also the target of a criminal investigation in
which he can decline to testify. It is planned that Kohl appear in late
spring and that he then be confronted with the testimony of earlier
witnesses. Former CDU Secretary General Heiner Geissler and former party
treasurer Walther Leisler Kiep will likely be called at the beginning of
April. Kiep's successor, Brigitte Baumeister, will be called in mid-April.

Finance Minister Schleusser takes leave after his resignation
</H1>
After the resignation of North Rhine-Westphalia's finance
minister Heinz Schleusser in the wake of the "flight scandal," a successor is
to be found as soon as possible. Deputy State Premier Michael Vesper (Greens)
does not believe that a decision will be made today. Likely candidates for
the position include Federal Finance Ministry Undersecretary Barbara
Hendriks, former Berlin Finance Senator Annette Fugmann-Hesing and the State
Finance Ministry Undersecretary Ernst Gerlach from Duesseldorf. Schleusser
defended his resignation to SPD members this morning. The decisive factor, he
said, was that he did not want his private life paraded in public.
Participants in the discussion said that no mention was made of lies. For the
CDU opposition, the resignation of the finance minister is only the first
step. According to CDU state parliamentary party chief Laurents-Meier, they
want to get rid of the whole corrupt bunch.
