Agreement on damages for Third Reich slave-labourers
</H1>
More than 4 decades after the end of WWII, surviving workers who where
forced to work like slaves under the Third Reich regime, will now
receive damages.  After months of haggling, Germany, the US and
representatives of the victims signed an agreement in principle in
Berlin. Damages will be paid from a fund to be fed by German business
and government. They will contribute 5 billion marks each. The
US-government, in return, made a statement that should guarantee
German businesses that they would largely be exempt from prosecution
in the US. A few more months are needed till the payout can begin.
Next February, there will be negotiations in Washington about who will
get how much. Estimates are that some 100,000 persons will be entitled
to payouts. Federal President (Bundespraesident) Rau asked the victims
for forgiveness.

</H1>
Volkswagen set up a memorial for former Third Reich slave-labourers, on
company-premises. Manager Kochs (sp?) emphasised that this was to show
respect for the victims' human dignity, that at the time had been
mistreated so badly. He called the fact that silence had been kept about
the matter since the end of WWII a lasting political scandal.

Joint effort to revamp pensions
</H1>
Government and opposition parties CDU/CSU and FDP want to co-operate in
attempts to revamp pensions, according to their last meeting in Berlin.
Chancellor Schroeder said he was confident that there would be a joint
solution till the end of next year. There would not be a general lowering
of the age of entitlement, according to Mr Schroeder, whereas head of the
CDU Schaeuble flatly ruled out that anyone should draw a pension at age 60.
The PDS party was not invited to the meeting.

East German Health Insurers to be subsidised / child-allowances rise
</H1>
Public Health Insurers in East Germany that are heavily in debt, will keep
getting billions of marks from West Germany. The relevant bill passed the
Upper House (Bundesrat) today, as the states of Saxony and Thuringia voted
for it. The opposition CDU/CSU previously had flatly refused to agree to
the draft-law. The Upper House (Bundesrat) also agreed to the compromises
forged by the Mediation Committee for the Upper House (Vermittlungsausschuss). Now  child-allowances can rise as of next year.

Commission of enquiry to look into flights on West/LB jets
</H1>
A commission of enquiry of the state parliament of North-Rhine/Westphalia
will look into the lawfulness of flights of former and present members of
government, carried out by jets of the Westdeutsche Landesbank, according
to today's unanimous decision in Dusseldorf. Government, however, had
enough votes to block an attempt by the CDU to extend the commission's
scope. Case in point was the dispute about the festivities for Mr Rau's
65th birthday - before he became Federal President (Bundespraesident).

Mr Kohl: decision on investigation by Public Prosecutor next Wednesday
</H1>
The Bonn Public Prosecutor will decide next Wednesday if they will
start investigations against former Chancellor Kohl in the matter of
hush-money for party-contributions. According to the office, this was
to give Mr Kohl's lawyers time to file more documents, as requested.
Yesterday, the former head of the CDU had admitted that over several
years he had accepted cash to the tune of 1.5 to 2 million marks. The
monies had not been accounted for as the donors had wanted to stay
anonymous.
