Number of part-time workers in drastic decline
</H1>
Following the new rules for "DM 630 jobs", the number of
part-time workers in retail trade and hotels and restaurants
dropped dramatically. According to the federal statistics office
1.7 million remained working part-time in these areas in April,
a drop of 106,000 against March. In the same monthly comparison,
full-time jobs increased by a mere 0.1%. Statisticians hold that
this is directly related to the new rules for marginal employment.

EU commission prepares court action against federal government
</H1>
According to FDP sources, the EU commission will go to court against
the federal government's decision to freeze plans for building an ICE
line between Nuremberg and Erfurt. The FDP's traffic expert Karl-Heinz
Guttmacher said the EU was preparing the action because Brussels
considers the freeze to infringe a former German pledge of building
this line as part of the EU high speed net. A total of DM 1.3 billion
has been invested in the plan, one third of which came out of EU
development funds.

Court decision on child support
</H1>
Persons who do not earn enough to raise their kids will have
to take on a second job to increase their income. This was decided
by the Schleswig-Holstein superior court in judging the case of a
warehouse worker earning DM 1,800 net. To assure the DM 600.00
minimum support for each of his 2 children he must work an additional
2-3 hours a week.
The situation is different if he receives unemployment compensation.
According to the court he will not have to do additional work because
any income would be deducted from his compensation.

more persons took their compensation in off hours instead of pay.
