systematic undermining by right-wing extremists. Defence minister Volker

SPD: OETV campaign is justified / coalition criticises it
</H1>
The Social Democrats rejected the federal government's criticism of the
unions' election campaign activities. In Bonn, SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine
called it the DGB's duty to talk about unemployment. According to a
statement released by the SPD, the unions should be allowed to represent
their opinions offensively. According to DGB-leader Schulte, his
organisation does not make any voting recommendations for a party or a
coalition. He said that the DGB campaign was only intended to demand
employment and social justice. Minister of Employment Norbert Bluem warned
the DGB of being the extended arm of one political party. FDP leader
Gerhardt called the union action unacceptable because of its being
financed through membership contributions by members with different
political opinions. Both politicians rejected the proposal of OETV-leader
Mai to introduce a 30-hour work week as being an inefficient means against
unemployment.
