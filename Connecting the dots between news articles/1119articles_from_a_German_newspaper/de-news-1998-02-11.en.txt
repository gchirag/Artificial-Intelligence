Kaufhof department store outlets in Stuttgart under extortion threat
</H1>
The Stuttgart branches of the Kaufhof department store chain are being
blackmailed for millions of Marks. According to a police statement issued
last night, an unidentified party has threatened to poison foodstuffs of
the stores unless his ransom demands are met. Apparently, suspect goods
have already been discovered at three warehouses. Present information is
that only dairy products have been affected. Police reports indicate,
however, that initial examinations have found no trace of poison.
Consumers are advised to examine the packaging of milk, quark, and yoghurt
products purchased at Kaufhof stores and to give suspicious goods to the
police.

DGB federation of unions calls for apprenticeship tax
</H1>
The German Federation of Unions (DGB) has called on the Government and all
the parties in the Bundestag to implement an apprenticeship tax. The DGB's
idea is that every company in Germany which could reasonably offer
apprenticeship training positions but doesn't would pay the tax; the money
would go toward financing such positions in businesses which do offer
them. The Government rejects the idea.
Meanwhile, the president of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce,
Stihl, has said that he expects the Germany economy to supply 300,000
training positions in 1998.

Public health insurance hikes not tied to higher pay-outs yet
</H1>
The plan to tie increased public health insurance contributions to higher
pay-outs for medications will not take effect this year. Several
newspapers published reports to this effect, quoting sources from within
the Coalition in Bonn. According to the "Hannover'sche Allgemeine Zeitung"
newspaper, the decision will apply to all rate hikes between march 11 and
December 31. The reports add that the deferment is formulated in an
amendment which is to be debated in the Bundestag Health Committee today.
The newspapers explain that the deferment is intended to help the Eastern
German public health insurance companies, which are under intense
financial pressure.
The leaders of the CDU, CSU, and FDP parties and parliamentary groups had
come to an agreement to end the separation of risk-structure equalizations
between the West and the East, which has been in place until now.

Germany is third-largest giver of foreign aid
</H1>
After Japan and the United States, Germany gives more money in foreign aid
than any other country. That is the result of an international comparison
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) in Paris. The study was based on data from the year 1996, and shows
Germany, spending 7.6 billion dollars, passing France, for the first time,
with its 7.5 billion dollars. The study also shows, however, that
developmental aid is down world-wide, from 58.9 billion dollars in 1995 to
55.5 billion dollars in 1996. The OECD said that a solid and flexible
finance system was an essential prerequisite for economic development in
poor countries.

Faculty member at Bundeswehr Military Academy speaks on Roeder affair
</H1>
A member of faculty at the Bundeswehr Military Academy, Lieutenant Colonel
Barandat, testified today before the parliamentary investigation committee
on the Roeder affair. He said that four months after Roeder's presentation
at the Academy in January 1995, he had made the former chief of staff at
the Academy, Schwarzer, aware that Roeder was a neo-Nazi. In testimony
given earlier, Schwarzer claimed not to have known about Roeder's
right-wing background, and described the invitation issued to him to speak
at the Academy as an embarrassing occurrence, which he had hoped would be
forgotten. This evening, Federal Defence Minister Ruehe is scheduled to
testify.

The police have made their biggest country-wide bust of an Asian
people-smuggling ring ever. They report having 85 people in custody
