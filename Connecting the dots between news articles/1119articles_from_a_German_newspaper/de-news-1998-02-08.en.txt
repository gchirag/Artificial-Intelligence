Cohen justifies threat of military action against Iraq
</H1>
US Defense Minister Mr. Cohen has again justified military
action against Iraq. Speaking at the Munich Conference on Defense Policy
Mr. Cohen said, the USA have proof that Iraq is hiding chemicals for
weapons of mass destruction from UN weapons inspectors. Generally the
USA prefer a diplomatic solution of the crisis, but this will only be
possible if Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, accepts unconditional
inspections of his weapons arsenal. Cohen also demanded greater
involvement of the European NATO partners in the realization of the
Dayton Agreement for Bosnia. German Defense Minister Mr. Ruehe replied
that so far the offer of the Europeans has not been acknowledged
sufficiently. The European partners want to maintain their current
number of military personnel in Bosnia.

208,000 people are receiving unemployment benefit. These people are 58

Referendum on changes to Bavarian constitution
</H1>
In Bavaria, voting in a referendum on changes to the state
constitution began this morning. The most important point is the
question whether the Senate should be abolished or reformed. The
committee is unique in Germany and makes recommendations to the state
parliament and government but does not have the authority to make
decisions. The Senate is composed of representatives of associations,
churches and clubs. The Social Democratic Party, the Green Party, the
Liberal Democrats and the ecological party OEDP want to do away with the
Senate because it costs 8 million marks every year; the Christian
Democratic Union, however, favors reforming it.
The Bavarians are also voting about a reduction in the size of the
cabinet and the state parliament, as well as an increase in the term of
office from four to five years.
