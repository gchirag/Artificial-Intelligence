leadership for the party. Lower Saxony's Premier Schroeder earned a
leading place within the party in a single round, with an approval rating
of 75 percent of the votes. Brandenburg's Social Minister Hildebrandt,

Matthaeus-Meier, Brandenburg's Premier Stolpe, and North
Rhine-Westphalia's Premier Clement, among others, were all (re-)elected
into the party leadership.
Preceding the leadership elections, delegates approved, by a large

proposal supports the introduction of the euro within the framework of the
established time-plan, saying that economic and monetary union must be
realized in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty and its scheduling.
Afterwards, the delegates approved a proposal dealing with the future
position of public broadcasting. The proposal supports the continuation of
ARD and ZDF television, and even their development on a European level.

Employers' Association President calls for cuts to social safety net
</H1>
Speaking at the annual convention of the National Employers'
Confederation, its president, Hundt, said that the present
all-encompassing safety net was no longer financially viable, and should
therefore be cut to subsistence levels, in order to relieve employers of
the enormous associated costs. For public health insurance, this would
mean that only absolutely essential services would be paid for. Hundt also
called for pension levels to fall much more quickly than the government
had planned. He also said that private insurers should play a much larger
role in old age security.

The Public Prosecutor's Office in Munich has initiated an inquiry into
suspicions of new right-wing activities in the German Army. According to a

barracks in Altenstadt, Bavaria, and are supposed to have shouted
right-wing slogans and displayed Nazi emblems. The incident happened in

individually, and not being indicative of a wide-spread problem within the
German Army. According to the Defence Ministry, five of the six soldiers
are still in active duty; they are to be discharged.
