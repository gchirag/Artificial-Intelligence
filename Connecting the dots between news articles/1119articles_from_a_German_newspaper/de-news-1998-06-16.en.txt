EU summit closes in Cardiff
</H1>
The opposing views regarding a decrease of German net contributions to the
EU budgets have not come closer at the European Union summit in Wales. A
paragraph was included in the final document stating that some EU states
demanded a fair balance of contributions. Germany, however, is not
mentioned explicitly. Other EU countries upheld their opposition against
the German demand in the final document. The countries agreed to find a
fairer balance of contributions within the next nine months. German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said he was sure that the dispute could be resolved
under the German presidency next March. Germany is by far the largest net
contributor in the EU, paying 20 billion DM more than it gets in return.
The EU government leaders also passed a timetable for the controversial
"Agenda 2000".

Stasi claims: Stolpe's claim rejected
</H1>
Manfred Stolpe, State Premier of Brandenburg, may be called a former Stasi
(GDR secret service) collaborator. This is the finding of the Federal High
Court. Thus, a statement by CDU politician Mr. Lehmann-Brauns of Berlin is
protected by the freedom of speech law. The Court stated explicitly that
the question was not whether Stolpe really was a Stasi collaborator. The
Brandenburg State Premier criticized the finding. Slander of political
opponents must not be set above the protection of personal honour. Stolpe
announced that he would appeal the verdict.

a differentiated way. Herzog said on Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk radio one

Billion DM damage caused by economic crime related to German unification
</H1>
Embezzlement, fraud, and other economic crimes in the course of the German
unification have caused between 3 and 10 billion DM worth in damage. The
president of the inquiry committee "GDR assets", Mr. Neumann said on the
occasion of the presentation of the final report that there would likely be
a large number of undiscovered cases. The perception that the committee
would uncover all areas of the GDR system could not be fulfilled. On the
other hand, Neumann said, not everyone was prepared to bring light into the
matter.

Buendnis 90/Gruene demand further investigations of right extremism
</H1>

right extremism in the German armed forces. According to B90/G the
parliamentary ad-hoc committee on right-extremism has completed its task
insufficiently. One day before the closing f the committee's work the
defence expert of B90/G, Angelika Beer accused Defence Minister Volker
Ruehe of playing down right-extremist incidents as individual cases. B90/G
therefore demanded to set up an independent expert committee even before
the general elections.
