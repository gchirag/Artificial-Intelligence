Extensive humanitarian aid for refugees from Bonn
</H1>
The Federal government is trying to prevent another massive influx of
refugees to Germany by providing extensive humanitarian aid to be used for
the refugees where they are currently located. According to statements from
Bonn, this aid is to be primarily in the form of food and supplies for
temporary housing. Germany has made a total of 25 million DM available for
aid in Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro. In the meantime, a 10 kilometer
long line of refugees from Kosovo has formed at the border with Albania.
Thousands of people in cars, trucks and horse-drawn carts are waiting to be
processed. According to the UN Commission for Refugees, more than 150,000
people have fled from Kosovo in the last nine days. A spokesperson said that
the rate of the exodus is increasing.

More atomic transports from La Hague to Gorleben

Minister of the Environment, Juergen Trittin, confirmed that the Federal
government has come to an agreement with Paris to create the provisions for
transports from the French reprocessing facility in La Hague to Gorleben. A
spokesperson said that the government would stand by its obligations to take
back the highly radioactive atomic waste from France. The ban on transports,
which was imposed by former Environment Minister Angela Merkel after
radioactive contamination had been discovered on the containers, was in
effect until now.

Criticism of ad campaign for social elections
</H1>
The ad campaign for the upcoming Sozialwahlen ("social elections" in which
representatives are elected to serve on the self-government boards of
federally subsidized health and pension insurance companies) is a waste of
money that serves a questionable purpose, according to the Taxpayers'
Association (Bund der Steuerzahler). The organization criticized that the
Federal Pension Plan Agency for Salaried Employees
(Bundesversicherungsanstalt fuer Angestellte or BfA) alone had spent 13.5
million DM on postage to send out an information pamphlet. The Taxpayers'
Association estimates the cost of the entire election at more than 100
million DM. That was a damn high price, as the Taxpayers' Association put it,
for something that claimed to be democratic self-government.

Eco-Tax drives up inflation rate
</H1>
The Federal Office for Statistics in Wiesbaden has announced that the
eco-tax, which goes into effect today, will increase the price index by about
0.4 to 0.5 percent. Only the direct effect on private consumer spending was
considered in this projection, not indirect effects on consumer prices.
According to preliminary figures, the inflation rate rose again in March for
the first time in eleven months and was 0.5 percent higher than a year ago
after holding at the record low of 0.2 percent in January and February.
