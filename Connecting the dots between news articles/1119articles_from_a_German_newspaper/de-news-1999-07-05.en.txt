Chancellor Schroeder does not rule out faster exit from nuclear power
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Schroeder said after a meeting of the SPD party committee that he did not consider it impossible to abandon nuclear power
earlier than scheduled. The Greens do not want power plants to supply
the system for more than 25 years, whereas the SPD demands a remaining
operating time of 35 years. According to Schroeder, wishes may always
be expressed, but they would have to be measured by whether they are
politically feasible. And the partner, who happens to be the energy
industry, has a slightly different opinion than the Greens. A dismissal
of nuclear power may only take place without any compensation. The chan
cellor was, nevertheless, a little bit surprised that the Greens would
conduct talks concerning a possible break-away from the government with
none other than the energy industry. But chancellor Schroeder looked at
this rather calmly.

Conflict about dismissal of nuclear power to be solved on Wednesday
</H1>
A crisis talk on Wednesday is to clear up the conflict between SPD and
Greens concerning the dismissal of nuclear power. However, the Greens
referred to reports today claiming a possible compromise between SPD and
Greens as "much ado about nothing." The chairperson of the Federal Commission on Nuclear Power Plant Safety, Christoph Matschie, said: "It
will also be important what concessions are made by the nuclear power
industry. Up to now, the 35-year operating time of nuclear power plants
could be considered an offer only. That is not be sufficient. I believe
we have to come up with operating times of less than 30 years."
The spokesperson of the Greens executive board, Roestel, does not view
the coalition to be under any immediate time pressure. It would not be
necessary to arrive at a coalition internal solution during Wednesday's
meeting.
