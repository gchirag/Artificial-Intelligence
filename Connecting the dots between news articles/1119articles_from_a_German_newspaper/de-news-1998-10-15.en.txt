NATO reaches agreement with Yugoslavia / Parliament votes tomorrow
</H1>
NATO signed an agreement with the Yugoslav army on aerial surveillance of
Kosovo. The agreement is part of a settlement between US envoy Richard
Holbrooke and President Slobodan Milosevic to resolve the crisis in
Kosovo. NATO hopes in this way to bring about the arranged withdrawal of
Yugoslav forces and the return of refugees. In Vienna, the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe authorized the use of 2000 members
of an OSCE mission to supervise compliance with the agreement on the
ground. Parliament (Bundestag) will vote tomorrow on German participation
in a possible NATO operation in Kosovo. A large majority in favor of
participation is expected. In an internal vote, the SPD parliamentary
group decided this evening to support participation.

Dispute between SPD/Greens over size of defense budget
</H1>
A dispute is brewing between the Social Democrats and Alliance 90/Greens
over the future size of the defense budget. The defense spokesperson for
the Greens, Angelika Beer, objected to efforts by the SPD to fix the
defense budget in the coalition contract. Ms. Beer told the newspaper
Berliner Zeitung that her party's approval of the entire package could be
endangered by this. Her SPD counterpart, Walter Kolbow responded that
party leader Oskar Lafontaine and the future Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
had assured Defense Minister designate Rudolf Scharping that the defense
budget would be linked to the development of the gross domestic product.

Experts from SPD/Greens doubt construction of "Transrapid"
</H1>
According to the opinion of transportation experts from the SPD and the
Greens, the high speed maglev rail line "Transrapid" will not be built.
Hans Georg Wagner (SPD) and Albert Schmidt (Alliance 90/Greens) expressed
the expectation that the federal government will drop out of the project
because of an expected explosion in construction costs. As the
Transrapid-Planning Corp. confirmed in Schwerin, the Federal Railways
Administration expects additional costs of up to 2.8 billion DM for the
construction of the rail lines alone. Additional expenses for the
drive-motor system are apparently also expected. The German Railway
(Deutsche Bahn) declared yesterday it would still be willing to be the
administrator, but would not take on any additional expenses.

IG Metall union's demand for 6.5% raise supported by other labor unions
</H1>
After the moderate wage agreements of the last few years, labor unions
want to secure higher wages on a broad front in the collective bargaining
for 1999. According to the newspaper Bild Zeitung, the unions for the
public service and transportation sector (OeTV), trade, bank, and
insurance industry (HBV), and salaried employees (DAG) supported the
demand of the metal, engineering, and electronics union (IG- Metall) for a
6.5% increase. Herbert Mai, head of the OeTV, did not want to commit to a
specific number. According to Suedwestrundfunk radio, Dieter Hundt,
president of the employers' association, warned the unions against
aligning themselves with IG-Metall's course. He said that excessive
increases could trigger an increase in unemployment.
