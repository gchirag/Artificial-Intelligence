Schaeuble names potential Chancellorship candidates
</H1>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, head of the CDU/CSU faction, has for the first time
mentioned the names of potential candidates for Chancellorship. There were
several politicians in the Christian Union that have the capabilities for a
high leadership position, Schaeuble said in the weekly Bild am Sonntag.
These were amongst others State Premiers Biedenkopf and Stoiber, the
federal ministers Ruehe, Waigel, Kanther, Ruettgers, and Toepfer. Former
Interior Minister Seiters, too, were qualified for the job. Schaeuble,
however, underlined that the question about who would succeed Helmut Kohl
came too early. He would prefer if Kohl were reelected as Chancellor in
1998. Schaeuble was asked whether he would exclude himself from the group
of potential successors. He answered that he was very content with his role
as head of the Bundestag faction and he did not feel any urge to become
Chancellor.

Kohl rejects criticism of Waigel
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has rejected criticism of Finance Minister Theo
Waigel from within the party. In a newspaper interview Kohl said the demand
for a cabinet reshuffle was completely out of the way. Waigel was a
successful finance minister with a good international reputation. Lower
Saxony's CDU president Wulf had called for Waigel's replacement because the
tax reform committee would not get ahead under Waigel's leadership. Kohl
called the statement an individual attempt to distinguish oneself, which he
could not understand. The State Premier of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Manfred
Seite, too, criticized the tax plans. The CDU politician said in the daily
Leipziger Volkszeitung if the discussion kept going the same way as it does
now, the result would be just a tiny reform. With this, the CDU would not
win the 1998 general elections.

Last day of PDS party congress in Schwerin
</H1>
A debate on the party's statutes marked the morning of the last day of the
PDS party congress. In the afternoon, the delegates voted on a motion
intended to reduce the influence of such groups as the Communist platform.
The groups should no longer be allowed to send delegates to the party
congresses. This was supposed to make the PDS more predictable according to
the party leadership. The party left wing, however, wanted to hold fast at
the old statutes. A motion on the first day to remove the motion to change
the statutes from the agenda, however, had failed. In the end, the motion
to change the statutes was turned down and the Communist platform will
retain the privilege to send their own delegates to the next party
congress. Since 1990 the platform was alloted 6 delegates. The various
interest groups within the PDS may send as many as 20 delegates in total.

Engelen-Kefer for action against pseudo-self-employment
</H1>
Vice-president of the National Federation of Unions Ursula Engelen-Kefer
has called on the government to take decisive steps against so-called
pseudo-self-employment. By driving employees into alleged self-employment
the social insurance would lose DM10 billion annually, said Ms.
Engelen-Kefer in an interview with the daily Luebecker Nachrichten. The
evasion of social insurance contributions was a criminal offence that,
however, was rarely prosecuted, in spite of the common knowledge that the
corresponding laws were violated hundreds of thousands of times each year.

Hundt for cutting pensions
</H1>
Employers president Dieter Hundt has spoken in favour of reducing the
pension level. At the same time he called for more private pension plans
and individual accountability for social insurance. In a newspaper
interview Hundt said an [average] pension level of 72 percent could not be
maintained in the long run. Earlier, Labour Minister Norbert Bluem had
already stated that the pension level needed to be adjusted. The current
system of old age provision was burdened by the decreasing number of
contributors while at the same time pensions had to be paid for a longer
time. Bluem, however, did not want to confirm the mentioned reduction of
the pension level to 63 percent.

Regensburgers vote on the future of the Stone Bridge
</H1>
The citizens of Regensburg have been called today to vote on the future of
the 850-year-old world-famous Stone Bridge across the River Danube because
daily traffic destroys the bridge. One proposal calls for the restriction
of the bridge for private traffic only. Busses, taxis, cyclists, and
pedestrians would be allowed to continue to use the bridge. The alternative
is to close the bridge only after a replacement bridge has been built. The
bridge is the only street connecting downtown Regensburg with the
subdivision Stadt am Hof.
