Slight increase in unemployment
</H1>
The number of unemployed in Germany increased again to
3.95 million in November compared with October. The rate increased from 10.1
to 10.2 percent, compared with 11.3 percent in November 1998 [sic]. The
president of the Federal Labor Office, Bernhard Jagoda, attributed the
increase primarily to seasonal influences, including the early arrival of
winter weather. In general, however, the economic revival could still be felt.
The German Federation of Trade Unions counted the weak domestic demand as one
of the reasons for the increase.

Contractors Association: create reliable framework conditions quickly
</H1>
Contractors (das Handwerk) called on the federal government to create
reliable framework conditions quickly for investment and more jobs. The
Central Association of German Trade deemed the first talks about an "alliance
for work" to be a sound platform. Association President Dieter Philipp
stressed the contractors' willingness to create more jobs. In order to
accomplish this, however, tax relief for small businesses and a moderate,
long-term wage policy were necessary.

Metal workers head warns against including wage policy in "alliance" talks
</H1>
After yesterday's first discussions on an "alliance for work," the head
of the union for metal, engineering and electronics (IG-Metall), Klaus
Zwickel, again warned against making wage policy demands an issue in the
talks. Zwickel said that any attempt to drag wage policy into the discussions
would mean the end to the alliance. Wage guidelines should not become the goal
of the alliance. The head of the German Federation of Trade Unions (DGB),
Dieter Schulte, previously had not ruled out discussing wage policy in the
framework of the talks. Schulte praised the developments in the first round of
talks that had led to constructive deliberations. The main topic of this first
round was retirement at age 60.

Ways and Means Committee approves second part of tax reform package
</H1>
With the votes of the red-green majority, the Ways and Means Committee
today approved the second part of the planned 1999 tax reform. The decision
ignored the amendment requests made by the opposition and business
associations. The law is expected to be passed by the Bundestag on Thursday
and to take effect on January 1, 1999. Among other things, it provides for an
extension from 6 to 10 years of the retention period for receipts by
businesses. This would enable more effective prosecution of tax evasion.

Institute of economy: wage claims too high
</H1>
The German institute for economy claims (DIW) considers the wage
increases of 6.5% claimed by the IG Metall for exaggerated. According to
DIW-expert Horn, this can lower the international competitiveness of Germany
since the labour and therefore the German products become to expensive.
Horn believes that a wage increase of 3.5% can be considered moderate.

"Pallas"-disaster: total costs around 24 million DM
</H1>
The struggle against the oil and the rescue work of the sea-damaged
wooden freighter "Pallas" has cost more than 12 million DM so far. According
to the authorities, the same amount has to be spend for the removing of
the wreck. The insurance of the ship only covers only 3.3 million DM. That means
that the Bund and the five coastal countries have to cover the difference.
According to the experts, the unloading of the wood remnants and the pumping
off of the oil will probably be taking another two weeks, if the weather will
be good.

Inner-party controversy within the SPD regarding collaboration with PDS
</H1>
The controversies within the SPD regarding the collaboration with the
PDS are still existent. The Eastgerman member of the Bundestag Hilsperg warned
his party of continuing the collaboration with the successor of the SED.
According to Hilsperg, the risks that the PDS involves, do not seem to be
discussed enough within the SPD. He reminded of the PDS' suggestion to give
the amnesty to the wall marksmen and the former GDR officials. This shows that
the PDS is basically representing the interests of the old GDR-cadre. According to
the  Saxonian SPD-chairman Kunkel, only things can be forgiven if the awareness
of the wrongdoing exists. This is were the PDS fails.

Federal minister of justice against violent educational methods of parents
</H1>
Federal minister of justice Dauebler-Gmehlin wants to take action against
violence used by some parents as educational methods. The SPD-politician announced
this plan of the government coalition in a newspaper interview. Children that get
beaten up by their parents easily tend to react in a violent manner. Therefore
this  vicious circle has to be broken. With the planned amendment, the legislator
rather has to concentrate on the conviction of the parents than to send the public
prosecutor into every family.
