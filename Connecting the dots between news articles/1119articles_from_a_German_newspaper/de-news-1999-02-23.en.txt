Start of budget debate in parliament
</H1>
Four months after the new government came into office, the first red-green
budget bill started a hefty exchange of words between government and
opposition in the Bundestag. Starting the four-day debate, Finance Minister
Oskar Lafontaine said, the budget was in line with the main targets of the
red-green government, to fight unemployment and to increase economic
growth. In contrast to  FDP and CDU/CSU, the government would relieve
families and the small business sector, said the minister who introduced
the 1999 budget. Lafontaine called for further reductions of the interest
rates  by the European Central Bank and wage demands in line with the
economic productivity. CDU/CSU and FDP accused the coalition of lack of
plan, a wrong policy and inability in craftsmanship. Vice-president of the
CDU-CSU faction Friedrich Merz said the budget bill was a document of
helplessness. Repeated touch-ups, especially in tax politics, suggested
that Lafontaine could not cope with the subject. The CDU politician added
that it was obvious that SPD and Greens would soon raise the sales tax.

Schily: EU countries were surprised by Kurdish riots
</H1>
The riots of PKK supporters after the arrest of separatist leader Abdullah
Ocalan were completely unexpected by the EU member states, said Germany's
Interior Minister Otto Schily after a meeting of EU ministers of interior
affairs. As a consequence, Schily and his colleagues agreed to improve the
information exchange about PKK activities.
According to Schily, radical Kurds shall no longer be able to plan riots
without being detected. Further, violent offenders would have to expect
expulsion. He warned again to make a connection between the latest riots
with the planned change in the citizenship code. This was rejected by Erwin
Marschewski, CDU. A foreigner with double citizenship who had been
convicted could not be expelled. Mr. Marschewski called for the rigorous
expulsion of all violent Kurds. Turkey had assured that the human rights of
the expelled would be honoured.
