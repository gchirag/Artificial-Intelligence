General election: Schroeder warns comrades
</H1>
The Social Democrats' (SPD) candidate for the chancellorship, Gerhard
Schroeder, has warned his party not to be prematurely confident of
victory and make untenable election promises. Speaking at a convention
in Magdeburg, Mr. Schroeder said, in spite of favorable polls, the
election on September 27 has not yet been won. Before the SPD promises
to withdraw legislature introduced by the present coalition, it has to
be made sure that such a policy would be financially sound.

Metal Union demands new tariff models
</H1>
The Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics (DGB) has
demanded new tariff models that better reflect present work demands. At
a conference of the SPD committee for employee issues, the Union's Vice
President Mr. Riester said that working hours or the number of units
produced are no longer used for the measurement of productivity. What
counts in the work place is rather to reach a certain goal by a certain
date. This brings into question existing working hour regulations and
has to be reflected in collective wage agreements. Mr. Riester rejected
criticism of the DGB election campaign. At issue is not a bias for the
SPD but partisanship in the interest of employees, he said. DGB Vice
President Mrs. Engelen-Kefer said that even the top officials of German
industry are biased and help the government.
