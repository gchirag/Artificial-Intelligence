Local elections in Schleswig-Holstein
</H1>
Local elections are taking place in Schleswig-Holstein today. The
provincial electoral office in Kiel said that voting had started quietly.
2.2 million voter will vote for city, district communal and communal
parliaments. Very few young people had voted by Sunday afternoon.
Sixteen-year-olds in Schleswig-Holstein were able to vote in local
elections for the first time. In addition, around 30000 voters from other
EU states were also entitled to vote in these elections. These elections
are considered to be a test run for the national German elections in
September. It is therefore of interest to see whether the SPD will be
able to assert themselves as the strongest party three weeks after
winning the state election in Lower Saxony. Four years ago the SPD
achieved 39.5 percent of the vote, while the CDU attained only 37.5
percent.

New suggestion regarding 620 Mark jobs
</H1>
Mr. Freitag, the chairman of the board for the Federal Social
Insurance Office for Salaried Employees (BfA) has made some new
suggestions regarding compulsory social insurance deductions for people
employed under the 620 Mark basis. He used Austria as an example where
small firms or private households do not have to deduct social insurance
contributions for employees earning less than a certain income. However,
large firms are prevented from splitting a full-time job over several
part-time employees in order to avoid paying social insurance
contributions. Mr. Freitag represents the Unions on the Board of the BfA.

Disagreement amongst Greens regarding taxing diesel fuel
</H1>
Husstett, the spokeswoman on political environmental matters for the
parliamentary fraction for the Greens, has contradicted statements made
by Ms. Seibold, a party colleague, regarding the taxation of aeronautic
diesel fuel. Ms. Husstett said that the diesel fuel tax was supported by
the government, but that Germany could not act on its own regarding this
tax. It would only make sense if it were introduced to the whole of
Europe, she said. Ms. Seibold had said to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag"
that the Green party would like to drastically increase the price of
aeronautic diesel fuel to encourage holiday makers to use more
environmentally friendly means of transport. She said that it was
sufficient for Germans to fly overseas once every five years. Ms.
Husstett contradicted this statement as well. She said that it has
nothing to do with politicians where and when someone spends their
holiday.
