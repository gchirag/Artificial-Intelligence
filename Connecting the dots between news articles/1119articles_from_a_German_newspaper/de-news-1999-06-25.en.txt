Parliament for holocaust monument
</H1>
A vast majority of the members of parliament (Bundestag) voted against the
"Eisenman II" draft for a holocaust monument. The draft provided for rows
of columns and a small information stand. Theologian Schroeder's proposal
to put up a monument with the inscription "Do not murder", however, was
voted down. Earlier on, parliament had decided that they did not want to do
away with a monument altogether (439 for, 115 against). Then they voted for
building a monument for the murdered European Jews only (325 for, 218
against).

Reactions to parliament's decision on holocaust monument
</H1>
After the decision for the holocaust monument, most politicians across all
parties were happy and relieved. President of the Central Jewish Council
in Germany, Mr Bubis, was glad that parliament's vote for the monument
had also been what the people wanted. One of the backers of the monument,
Ms Rosh, said she wanted to work with the trust fund set up to look after
the project - though she anticipated delays caused by the state of Berlin.

Chancellor Schroeder: no tax-hikes
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder ruled out more tax-hikes before the next federal
elections. When interviewed by the tabloid BILD, he stated that the debate
was closed as far as this legislative period was concerned. Tax-hikes and
more spending would not fit the picture. Referring to ideas by the SPD
parliamentary group about re-introducing the tax on private assets
(Vermoegenssteuer), Mr Schroeder said that checking them out wouldn't cost a
red cent. But he was adamant that he wanted to lower taxes, not raise them.

Life assurances to be taxed
</H1>
Government decided to save money and that's why all capital life assurance
policies will attract tax at the rate of 25% after 22 June. That's when
cabinet agreed to the new scheme, according to the Finance Minister.
Existing policies or policies with monthly subscription payments would not
be affected. Also Labour Minister Riester allegedly wanted to window-dress
numbers so he could lower pensions. According to the newspaper HANDELSBLATT,
child benefit payments (Kindergeld) would not be included in the average net
wage any more (used for the calculation of pensions). Government, however,
countered that they had to do it, to comply with EU-rules

Minister for Internal Affairs lifts deportation stop
</H1>
As of today, federal borderguards (Bundesgrenzschutz) may deport persons
whose applications for asylum have been turned down, even if they are
expected to vigorously resist deportation. This virtually ends the
preliminary stop on deportations in similar circumstances, ordered by
Minister for Internal Affairs Schily following the death of a Sudanese man.
Allegedly new rules had been worked out, and as of today no more
bike-helmets would be used. The Baden-Wuerttemberg government stated that
they would not deport anyone themselves in this manner.
