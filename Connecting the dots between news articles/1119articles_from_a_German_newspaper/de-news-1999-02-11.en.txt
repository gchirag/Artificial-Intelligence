Beck believes a compromise on dual citizenship can be reached
</H1>
Rhineland-Palatinate's state premier Beck believes there is a good
chance for a compromise solution in the dual citizenship matter which
could obtain a Bundesrat majority. In an interview to "Sueddeutsche
Zeitung", Beck said the ideas of his social/liberal government and
the Bonn coalition were very close. A consensus around temporary
dual citizenship for children of aliens resident in Germany, as well as
for grown-ups would certainly be reached. Minister for interior Schily
said in a ZDF-TV interview that his working proposal would continue
to be the basic one for the talks. Combining it with parts of the
Rhineland-Palatinate proposal was thinkable. According to the
Mainz proposal, a definitive decision on citizenship would have
to be made at age 23. Grown-ups might obtain dual citizenship
during a 3-year period.  The Bundesrat votes of Rhineland-Palatinate
will be needed to obtain a majority.

The Green party's leadership spokeswoman, Roestel, refuses to accept the
model proposed by Mainz, admitting, however, that the change in the
Bundesrat majority would force her party to make some kind of move.
CDU chairman Schaueble, on the other hand, came out against any kind
of dual citizenship, temporary or not, thereby rejecting opinions of parts
of the FDP, but also of his own party.
