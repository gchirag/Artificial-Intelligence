Federal government plans supplementary budget
</H1>
Talks about "a big tax-reform", something that would help and make the system
simpler plus have everyone pay less tax, are a thing of the past by now.
As the budget-deficits are huge, government's coalition-parties want to
change the system as early as next year, even hurting big companies in the
process. As far as the current year was concerned, Mr Bohl, Chancellor Kohl's
right-hand man, now announced a supplementary budget, meaning more debt, as
there was no other way to plug the gaps. Government did not mention any
figures so far, but they intend to declare that the economy was out of
kilter, due to the high level of unemployment, justifying the taking out of
loans surpassing investments during the current financial year. Government's
majority in parliament previously had made sure this would not re-occur
in 1998, when federal elections are due.

Stricter regulations as far as the writing-off of losses were concerned, as
well as partially taxing reserves some nuclear power plants had accumulated,
and other cuts to privileges business had enjoyed so far, would raise
some 4 billion marks in additional revenue. The tax-exemption for
small-scale savers, however, will not get halved before 1999, and
life-insurance pay-outs will not get taxed before 1999 either. The SPD
announced they would be against, but there is hope the SPD-led majority in
the Upper House (Bundesrat) will not prevail.

G8-summit meeting in Denver about to begin
</H1>
Tonight the first G8-summit meeting will take place in Denver/Colorado,
though so far it is not clear if Russia will officially become part of
the family (this time the Russian delegation will attend practically all the
meeting, regardless). Currently Germany does not exactly top the rankings,
as far as economics are concerned: her growth-rate is below average whereas
her unemployment-figures are a lot higher than the other G7-countries'.
Even for old salts such as Chancellor Kohl, everything is different this
time. Russia is part of it, right from the beginning, and Mr Kohl made it
clear that Russia was there to stay. Not all members share Mr Kohl's
enthusiasm about Mr Yelzin's taking part in this summit-meeting: Japan does
not want it to become permanent, quoting still unresolved post-war
problems between their respective countries. Germany want to push
environmental questions at Denver. Mr Kohl wants the US to significantly
lower their massive CO2-emissions (polluting the earth's atmosphere), and he
also wants to promote a convention on forests, as five years after the Rio de
Janeiro UN-environmental summit, clear-felling still makes sure an area the
size of Greece goes every year. This, however, will go against the US' and
Japan's grain: they think the German proposals are a bit over the top.

Protestants meet in Leipzig
</H1>
Communication between religions and social issues were on today's agenda.
The latter included high unemployment, East-West rift (between the 'two
Germanys') and the media's job. The meeting, which was attended by 106,000
Christians, is scheduled to finish this Sunday. Well-known comic Dieter
Hildebrandt layed into today's media's 'beautiful new world': it wasn't
exactly beautiful, rather miserable, and endangering society's cohesion to
boot. Was it really the bee's knees, or will it rather lead to more
sheep-like followers and an entertainment-proletariat? Ratings are becoming
more and more important, so quality goes out the door, and soaps have to get
cheaper and cheaper (to make). Humans will end up becoming remote-controlled
zombies who'd buy anything to please the advertisers.

Metal-workers' union against global exemption-clauses in awards
</H1>
The metal-workers union (IG-Metall) would never buy into global so-called
exemption-clauses in awards, as they would do away with collective
bargaining and industrial action. They would, however, be inclined to be
more flexible as far as awards covering a whole geographical area were
concerned. And they would not say no to 'bending' the awards for a set time,
provided that helped a company get out of strife.
