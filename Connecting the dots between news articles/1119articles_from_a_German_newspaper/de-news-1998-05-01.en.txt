11 countries to be founding-members of European Currency Union
</H1>
As expected, the European Union's finance ministers
nominated 11 countries for membership in the European Currency Union.
At this first stage, the current EU-members will be in; however, Greece,
Denmark, Great Britain and Sweden will stay out for the time being. They
also agreed to an additional pledge concerning the euro's stability,
required by Germany. This pledge was about running a tight ship
budget-wise and paying off public debt, as of July 1 of this year,
that's half a year before the  start of the currency union.

<P>
Heads of state and government will make the final decision tomorrow,
at the summit meeting proper, and that's also when they will decide
on who will head the European Central Bank.

Labour Day rallies
</H1>
According to the unions, approximately  500,000 people took
part in rallies for the May 1 holiday (Labour Day). Head of the
unions (DGB) Schulte asked for a change of direction in Germany while
taking part in a demonstration in Munich. Germany would now need an
effective and active employment policy. Elsewhere union bosses
accused government of being responsible for new record-highs in
unemployment. They also refuted claims that they were pushing certain
political parties' barrows during the current electioneering.

<P>
Previously CDU/CSU and FDP had accused the unions of siding with the
SPD.

Heavy clashes in Leipzig
</H1>
Today there were severe clashes during a demonstration by
the right-wing extremist party NPD at the monument commemorating the
battle of Leipzig (Voelkerschlachtsdenkmal). While the predominantly
younger NPD followers got themselves organised, left-wing protesters,
some wearing face-masks, attacked more than 6,000 police with rocks,
bottles, iron balls and firecrackers. Police retaliated with truncheons
and water-cannons. Eight police and an unknown number of protesters were
injured, some severely. Several dozen people were detained. Some
NPD-members, trying to improvise a parade without having obtained a
permit previously, got into fights with police. Police, however, were
able to keep left- and right-wingers from fighting each other.

head of the DVU Frey a favour, when the latter had asked him for it.
Mr Schoenhuber said that he agreed as that would put an end to the
infighting between the German right-wing parties.
