SWR-radio and television network starts taking shape
</H1>
The committees of the new SWF state radio- and
television-network started work today, voting for Mr Hans Lambert as first
president. There will be more voting until 13 March, though not many
outsiders will be competing against incumbents of the two organisations
being amalgamated. Previously state premiers Teufel and Beck, of
Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate respectively, had stated that
the new SWF would be seen as a chance to reform the association of state
radio- and television-networks (ARD).

'Our lips are sealed...'
</H1>
A hunger-strike staged by 64 Kurds in Augsburg lasted a mere three hours:
the men wanted to demonstrate against what they considered slow processing
of their applications for asylum. After the district council had proposed to
assist them they stopped. To drive the message home, two Kurds literally
sealed their lips by stitching them together. Police and representatives of
the district council as well as of the city of Augsburg were involved in the
after-hours negotiations. The Kurds returned to their quarters at about
5 o'clock in the morning when they were offered to put pen to paper and sign
a petition. The two Kurds who had sealed their lips had to be treated at a
hospital.

Mentally retarded fight back
</H1>
The Association for Mentally Retarded Persons intends to collect signatures
against a ruling by a Cologne court. The judge had ordered a group of them
to stay out of their garden at certain times, as a neighbour, who had
claimed that the retarded persons' voices were putting too much of a strain
on him, had won in court. The Association wants a law banning discrimination
against retarded people.

Franconia: counterflash device impounded
</H1>
Schweinfurt police impounded an automatic flash, triggered by a
speed-camera's flash and resulting in the car's number-plate becoming
unreadable. Apparently the manufacturers are loacated in the district,
though the public prosecutor is not giving away any details. Spare-part
suppliers and the general public had received chain-letters selling the
product called Contraflash. Investigators take it that this would breach
consumer legislation, as the suppliers had led them to believe that using
Contraflash was not against the law. This would be a case for the
Business Courts.

K.o.-drops trial in Nuremberg
</H1>
Today the so-called Knock-out drops trial at the Nuremberg/Fuerth Regional
Court entered round two. From 1991 to 1995 two men from Croatia had drugged
and robbed more than 50 men; five of them died from the effects of the
drugs. Today defence counsel started pleading. Senior prosecutor Heidner
previously had asked for two life-sentences, and also wanted both closely
investigated as to any eventual mitigating circumstances.
