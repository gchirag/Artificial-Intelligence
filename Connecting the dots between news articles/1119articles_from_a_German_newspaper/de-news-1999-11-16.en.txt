Expert committee criticizes health reform of A. Fischer
</H1>
An expert committee including members of the Red-Green
coalition has criticized the health reform of Health Minister Andrea
Fischer. The reform would lead to a two-class health care. In their
counter-opinion the experts propose to increase competition among the
public health insurers and to lift the restrictions for the
certification of physicians by the public health insurers. At the same
time, the experts call on the politicians to admit that an optimal
health care can no longer be supported by public health insurers.

Fall opinion of economic think-tanks forecasts economic growth
</H1>
Five experts of economics, also known as the Five Wise Men,
predict 2.7 percent economic growth next year. In spite of the growth,
unemployment will not decline significantly. The experts presented
their fall report today. Just under 220'000 fewer unemployed people
than last year -this the experts called good luck rather than merit,
because fewer young people entered the job market due to the low birth
rate [following the baby boom in the 60s]. The Five Wise Men welcomed
Finance Minster Hans Eichel's austerity package but considered his
plans for a reform of enterprise taxes beside the point. The experts
also criticized the government's pension policy and the government's
refusal to make the job market more flexible. They called the Alliance
for Employment a foreign body in the German political system.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stressed that the austerity policy would
continue and conceded that more reforms were needed. "This outlook on
the job market is not enough for us" Schroeder said. The Council of
German Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) welcomed the pressure that the
expert opinion puts on politician to continue the reform process, but
the council remarked that the 2.7% growth were not sure, yet.

Mobile phone carrier Vodafone: hostile takeover of Mannesmann
</H1>
British mobile phone carrier Vodafone is determined to take
over Mannesmann in a hostile bid. The company announced that it would
offer to the shareholders an exchange rate for the shares until Monday.
Apparently, there will be no cash transactions. Vodafone head Chris
Gent said a hostile takeover was possible if the Mannesmann executive
board was not ready to give in within the next days. As a precaution,
Vodafone guarantees to keep the jobs at Mannesmann. The Mannesmann
location in Duesseldorf would continue to play a major role and would
not be abandoned. Mannesmann, however, sues a British investment bank
that consults both Vodafone and Mannesmann.

Further disagreement on compensation NS prisoners-of-war
</H1>
The former NS prisoners-of-war are insisting on a compensation of
over 10 million DM.  Their lawyer Witti declared that the current
government offer of 7 million in totally unacceptable. The government
representative Lambsdorff is sceptical on whether a new round of
negotiations will lead to an agreement. The talks may fail unless both
sides are prepared to compromise. Since yesterday the government is
offering 3 million DM for the negotiations, one million DM more than
previously. The German industry has hitherto committed itself to paying 4
million DM. German lawyers of the victims are demanding that all together
more than 10 million DM must be paid. Representatives of the Jewish World
Congress made it clear that it is not just about material demands, but
about the German side taking a clear position on general moral
responsibility for crimes committed during the NS period.

Districts must be able to buy central power supply system from suppliers
</H1>
In the dispute about the take-over of power supply systems, the
Federal Supreme Court has found in favour of the districts.The energy
suppliers won't be allowed to raise the price for their communal power
supply systems so high that a change over would be economically pointless
for the district. In the previous case the Kaufering district near Munchen
filed a complaint against the Bavarian Lech power station. The municipality
wanted tp pay 2 million DM for the power supply system, but the current
supplier is demanding 8.5 million DM. Now the provincial high court in
Munchen must decide on a reasonable price.
