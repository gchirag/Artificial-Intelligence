CDU/CSU favors Re-establishment of 40-hour work week
</H1>
The parliamentary party leaders of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag and in
the state parliaments favor re-installation of the 40-hour
work week for public services. Considering the financial
situation of the states, reducing debts has to take first place,
the chairman of the conference of CDU/CSU parliamentary party leaders,
Koch said in Frankfurt. This would not be possible without reducing the
payroll. So in order to reduce the head count,. employees in public
services should work 40 hours a week at the same salary.
 The DAG (Deutsche Angestelltengewerkschaft, national union of
employees) rejected this proposal. To talk of fighting unemployment
and at the same time kill jobs in public services was a contradiction
in itself.

Relatives of ICE victims slow to accept financial aid
</H1>
It seems that relatives of the Eschede disaster victims are slow
to accept the financial aid provided by the Federal
Government, the Deutsche Bahn and the states of Lower-Saxony and
Bavaria and which runs into several million DM.
Concurring reports say that only a small number of relatives have
asked for support. Most of the victims of the train
accident were from Bavaria according to Celle police sources.
By now, 79 of the 98 dead have been identified. In Eschede, at the
crash site, helpers are still finding parts of bodies, shreds of
clothes and personal property of passengers. The salvage
operations will probably be finished by tomorrow. In the afternoon it
should be possible resume traffic on the affected line. But the public
prosecutor might not agree to re-open the rail track. As a
consequence of this train accident the examination of the ICE steel
tyres is to turn routine in the future. Investigations by the
special commission are still going on. Another consequence of the
catastrophe will be that the Deutsche Bahn will reconsider its entire
security system. The reason for the catastrophe probably was a broken
steel tyre of the ICE. The central mourning ceremony for all victims of
Eschede will take place on June 21st in Celle in the presence of German
President Herzog.
