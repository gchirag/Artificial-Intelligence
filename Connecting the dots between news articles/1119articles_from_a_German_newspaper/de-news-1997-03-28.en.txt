Kirch will make do without 500-million loan
</H1>
The Munich media-czar Kirch will make do without a loan of 500 million marks
he was offered by the state of Bavaria. The company's manager, Mr Hahn, said
this was due to the less than serious discussion about a normal confidential
business transaction. And they would not have any problems to finance future
ventures anyway, even without the loan. Bavaria's premier, Mr Stoiber, said
that the decision was 'factually correct', and for the good of Bavaria's
media industry and their staff.

Thyssen-Krupp-Stahl AG to save money for both partners
</H1>
Half a billion marks are expected to be saved by amalgamating the two
steel-makers, Thyssen and Krupp. Krupp's CEO Kromme said the amalgamation
would be a success, creating one the most profitable steel-makers in the
world. Today Krupp-Hoesch workers went back to work to start their
early-morning shift. Yesterday the workers' representatives had recommended
putting an end to the (wild-cat) strikes, after Krupp-Hoesch and Thyssen
had given assurances that there would be no redundancies due to the
amalgamation until the year 2001.

Mr Seite criticises compromise on coal-subsidies
</H1>
The premier for Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Mr Seite, criticised the
compromise on bituminous-coal subsidies as an example of applying double
standards, one for West and a different one for East Germany. During the
last years, East Germany had lost hundreds of thousands of jobs, whereas now
jobs in West German coal-mines would get subsidised to the tune of billions
of marks. West Germany's society obviously had not understood what the
global economy was all about, and tried to hang on to dated sine-cures. All
of Germany, however, had to get a bit of a nudge, according to the
CDU-politician.

DGB pleads for resumption of tax-reform talks
</H1>
The German Federation of Trade Unions (DGB) asked government and SPD to have
another go and resume the talks about tax-reform. Formalities should not
keep them apart any more. And Chancellor Kohl would have to take an active
part as well. After all this was not about technical details, but to
achieve a major break-through in crucial issues. Amongst other things the
maximum tax-rate and the introduction of an eco-tax were at stake.

Mr Wulf accuses coalition partners of grave tactical errors
</H1>
Lower Saxony's head of the CDU-party, Mr Wulf, accused Bonn's coalition
partners of having committed grave tactical errors. Mr Wulf told the
magazine FOCUS that Mr Lafontaine's destructive strategy had been
underestimated far too long. Mr Lafontaine is head of the opposition
SPD-party. The coalition partners would now have to get into gear and fight
the decisive battle, by concentrating more on the federal states in order to
break the SPD's majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat).

Re-patriation procedures to be re-thought
</H1>
A group of politicians from all parties asked the state ministers to
have a re-think of the (forced) re-patriation of refugees from Bosnia.
They claimed the current procedures were not humane and would be neither for
the good of the refugees nor Germany's international interests. They would
have to return, no doubt about that, but there was no peace yet in Bosnia,
and that's where the rub was.

Another four Germans kidnapped in Yemen
</H1>
Another four German tourists were kidnapped in Yemen, according to the
Foreign Office in Bonn. The local ambassador heads the committee set up to
deal with the crisis. So far neither the identity nor eventual demands of
the kidnappers are known.

<P>
In spite of endeavours by the central government in Sana to put a stop to
this form of modern way-laying, which also hurts the local growth-industry,
viz. tourism, there were more and more similar incidents in the past few
months. Last time seven German motor-bike riders were forcibly held for
several days, in order to extort ransom-money, allegedly to the tune of
more than 9 millions.

Mr Otto John dead
</H1>
The first president of the German Domestic Intelligence Agency
(Verfassungsschutz), Mr Otto John, died aged 88 years, according to the
newspaper SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG. In 1954 and 1955 Mr John had spent some
time in the then GDR, yet could not come up with a satisfactory explanation
of the circumstances. When he returned to West Germany, he was convicted of
high treason and sentenced to 4 years in jail. He spent 40 years fighting for
a re-trial, yet to no avail. During the Third Reich Mr John had played an
important role in the organisation of the resistance movement against Hitler.

Storms cause millions of marks worth of damage
</H1>
High winds reaching speeds of up to 140 kph caused damage worth millions
of marks. Last night the storm lifted tiles off numerous roofs, mainly in
Brandenburg, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and North-Rhine/Westphalia.
Uprooted trees and collapsed power-pylons blocked roads and caused several
accidents. Trains were running late, some very much so. Emergency services
were busy, non-stop.
