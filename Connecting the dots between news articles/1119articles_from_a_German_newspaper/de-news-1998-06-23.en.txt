Compromise regarding Law on Aid for Asylum Seekers
</H1>
CDU/CSU and FDP have found a compromise for the law on Aid for Asylum
Seekers. The draft stipulates that only those foreigners have to expect
welfare cuts who can be shown to have abused the system. This would affect
people who enter Germany only to get at the aid or who want to prevent
their expulsion by destroying their ID cards. The law will affect about
20,000 people. The compromise was mostly along the lines of the FDP. The
SPD is going to support the bill in the Bundestag. The Bundesrat, the upper
house of parliament, will deal with the law on July 10.

SPD says government is fighting violent attitudes too laxly
</H1>
The Social-Democrats say the government is not doing enough against the
violent attitude in the German society. The SPD's law expert Herta
Daeubler-Gmelin said in view of the violence of German hooligans at the
soccer World Cup that the incidents were a reflection of the violent
attitude so often deplored in Germany. Ms. Daeubler-Gmelin demanded that
one must act rigorously against the suspects. One would also have to find
out whether the thugs were known to the intelligence service or the police.
The police union demanded a better coordination among the European
countries. Union president Lutz said, if necessary countries would have to
give up sovereign rights.

</H1>
The smuggling of plutonium from Moscow to Munich in August 1994 remains
unclear in many parts. This is the result of the parliamentary ad-hoc
committee after three years. Today, the committee presented the closing
report to President of the Bundestag Mrs. Rita Suessmuth. The parties were
unable to agree on a joint appraisal of the case. The government parties
cannot find any evidence that Mr. Schmidbauer, Co-ordinator for the
Intelligence Services in the Chancellor's Office was involved. The
oppositional parties, however, stressed that the allegations against Mr.
Schmidbauer could not be cleared.

inform the public earlier about increased radiation of nuclear waste
containers but neither were the companies obliged to do so. The companies
had recorded all measurements but kept them to themselves as technical
information.

Reform of transfer payments among German states
</H1>
The Tax Payers' Association of Baden-Wuerttemberg has demanded a
fundamental revision of the transfer payments among German states.
[Transfer payments from rich states are to benefit those federal states
with little tax income.] A study reports that Baden-Wuerttemberg
contributed in total 51 billion DM in transfer payments. This is the
largest contribution. A reform should force the receiver states to use the
payments only to increase their economic power.
The governments of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria want to decide about a
constitutional challenge of the transfers in a joint cabinet meeting on
Thursday.
