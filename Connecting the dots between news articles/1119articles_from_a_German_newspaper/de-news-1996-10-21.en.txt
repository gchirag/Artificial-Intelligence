CDU holds national convention
</H1>
The national convention of the CDU party began in Hanover today. Chancellor
Helmut Kohl opened the two-day conference with a speech stating principles.
Yesterday, the CDU chairman had called on the more than one thousand
representatives to agree to the women's quota. The proposal, intended to give
female CDU members a more proportionate share of CDU positions, had been
rejected at last year's convention. The party meeting will also focus on board
elections and tax policy. Mr. Wulf, chairman of the CDU in Lower Saxony, again
emphasized his party's intention to lower taxes. He told Deutschlandfunk radio
that the Christian Democrats are working towards a net relief of up to 30
billion marks. In order to finance the program, even more severe austerity
measures and the dismantling of privileges would be necessary, Wulf said. He
rejected the idea of increasing the VAT rates.

By evening, the CDU had
concluded elections to some top party offices. Michel Friedman, a member of the
Central Council of Jews in Germany, did not succeed in the run for a seat on
the federal board. The former minister of mail and telecommunications, Schwarz-
Schilling, also failed. The minister president of Thuringia, Vogel, achieved
the best result, gaining 86.3 percent of votes. Earlier, Chancellor Kohl had
been confirmed in his position as CDU chairman, receiving 95.5 percent of the
delegates' votes. The convention also accepted a proposal to improve protection
from sexual abuse of children, supported a call to have the Scientology church
observed by the federal agency for the protection of the constitution, and
postponed a vote on a proposal to facilitate the naturalization of immigrants.

EU should help with losses caused by BSE
</H1>
The minister of agriculture of Lower Saxony, Mr. Funke, called on the European
Union to provide balance payments for cattle-raising countries. In an interview
with Deutschlandradio Berlin, the SPD politician said that the developments in
the cattle markets were disastrous. He said that the decline in beef
consumption by 15 to 20 percent as a consequence of Mad Cow's Disease (BSE)
posed a serious risk to farmers raising cattle. Funke held the European Union
responsible because it had failed to judge the problem realistically for a long
time and had not taken appropriate measures.
