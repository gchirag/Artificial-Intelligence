Clinton visits Spangdalem and Ramstein
</H1>
US President Bill Clinton met the three American soldiers newly released
by Belgrade, at the US Air Force support base at Ramstein, Germany this
afternoon. He was also briefed on the aid shipments being sent into the
Balkans from the base. Earlier, he spoke to soldiers at Spangdalem, the
starting point of American stealth bombers on sorties against Yugoslavia.
Clinton thanked the soldiers for their efforts. He announced that the air
attacks on Yugoslavia would be widened, and would continue as long as
Kosovars were still being driven from their homes, saying that steadfast
opposition must be offered against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's
campaign of destruction. Clinton said there could be no peace without an
international force, with NATO at its center, guaranteeing a return of the
Kosovars driven from their homes.

Clinton to visit German housing for evacuated refugees
</H1>
Bill Clinton will visit the facilities in Ingelheim tomorrow which the
German government has made available for evacuated Kosovar refugees.
Around 1100 officers will ensure the American president's safety in
Ingelheim. The landing of his helicopter at a nearby soccer stadium has
been rehearsed, as has the 800-metre drive from the stadium to the refugee
housing. Clinton's arrival in Ingelheim is scheduled for 11:15 tomorrow
morning. He will spend about an hour in close conversation with two
pre-selected families from Kosovo, to get a first-hand account of
conditions in the region. Following that, Clinton will be joined by his
Foreign Minister Madeleine Albright, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and his Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer to view the facility. Clinton
will subsequently speak to the assembled refugees before flying out at 2
pm.

Budget debate dominated by Kosovo crisis
</H1>
The crisis in Kosovo came to dominate large sections of what was supposed
to be a budget debate in the Bundestag today. The opposition parties, with
the exception of the PDS, used the open debate period of the Chancellery
budget debate to voice their support for the government's policies on
Kosovo. CDU/CSU caucus leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said that the CDU/CSU
would approve the deployment of further German soldiers to the Balkans.
PDS caucus leader Gregor Gysi condemned the NATO attacks as an illegal war
of aggression. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer defended the alliance's engagement. Schroeder said that the
military action was necessary in order to reach a political solution.
Fischer refuted fears that the additional German soldiers, up to 1000 of
them, could become involved in a ground war; he said their only duty would
be to help the refugees in the camps.

</H1>
Despite some reservations, the caucuses of the CDU/CSU and the FDP voted
in favour of the government's 1999 defence budget, taking into account the
participation of German soldiers in the Kosovo conflict. The Bundestag
passed the budget by a vote of 549 to 35 (with 85 absences or
abstentions), granting Rudolf Scharping's Defence Ministry 47 billion DM
for 1999, an increase of 0.9 percent over last year.

Pacifist wing of Green Party moves against Fischer
</H1>
With eight days until the Greens' special party conference to discuss the
Kosovo conflict, a pacifist wing of the party has formed to oppose Federal
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer. A group of northern German Greens today
proposed a motion to end the NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia immediately.
If a majority of participants at the convention in Bielefeld on Ascension
Day (May 13) vote in favour of the motion, then Fischer will have lost the
backing of his party for his policies on Kosovo.

Opposition calls for retraction of laws on 630-DM jobs
</H1>
During today's budget debate, the Opposition accused the Government of
failure in its approach to the so-called 630-DM jobs, saying it had
achieved the opposite of what it had intended. During the Internal Affairs
portion of the budget debate, spokesmen for the CDU/CSU and the FDP called
upon the government to reverse its changes to the laws governing the
630-DM jobs and nominally independent contract-work. Chancellor Schroeder
replied that his government was correcting the mistakes of its
predecessor.

Schily wants easier dismissal procedures in public service
</H1>
According to Federal Internal Affairs Minister Otto Schily, it should be
made easier for all levels of government to dismiss employees in the
future. Schily told the weekly newspaper "Die Zeit" that he saw it as a
mistaken development that it was often practically impossible to dismiss
public service officials. He said that he had the impression, from talks
with the public service union OeTV, that the labour body was prepared to
consider reform proposals.

Deile must also dissolve real estate company
</H1>
After the loss of his musical production company, Stella, the rest of
Stuttgart entrepreneur Rolf Deile's empire is now also in pieces.
According to a newspaper report, Deile's real estate company Instag AG is
being dissolved, along with numerous subsidiary holdings. Some of Deile's
large projects, such as a planned solar-powered housing complex in
Freiburg had already been halted, according to the report, because
creditors refused to grant Deile, already heavily in debt, any further
credit.
