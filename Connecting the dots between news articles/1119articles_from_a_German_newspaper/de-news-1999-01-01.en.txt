As of today, it's the euro for non-cash transactions
</H1>
As of 1 January it's euro year - in Germany and 10 more EU-member countries.
Federal government, Mr Santer, president of the EU-Commission and
Mr Duisenberg, president of the European Central Bank, called this a
historic moment. In the financial metropolis of Frankfurt/Main several
thousand people celebrated the introduction of the euro, a currency that
will be used exclusively for non-cash transactions, for the time being.
As of tomorrow, however, cheques, debit- as well as credit-cards may be
made out in euro. Financial instruments made out in national currencies
will stay in circulation for another 3 years. One euro is worth almost
1.96 German marks.

a big wish come true. On radio Deutschlandfunk the former FDP-politician
said that in this day and age of globalisation a common stable currency

of member states.

Bankers change over to euro
</H1>
Several thousand staff of European banks did not have a New Year's Eve
party. They had to convert computer systems, as trading in shares and bonds
will be in euro only as of Monday. The Dresdner Bank, for example, will have
to cope with 9000 modifications to their banking software, at a cost of
250 million marks.
Yesterday the EU ministers of finance and economics pegged the exchange
rates of the euro. Now one euro is worth almost 1.96 German marks.

Germany chairs EU-Commission
</H1>
As of today Germany will chair the European Council, for the next 6 months.
The most important goals are, according to Chancellor Schroeder, reaching
an agreement on the subscriptions to the EU common treasury (some are
net-takers, others net-payers), the reform of European agriculture and
regional policies as well as the planned European covenant for employment.
Fighting unemployment is on top of Germany's list of priorities. There has
to be a European covenant for employment, that's what 15 member states had
agreed on during their recent summit-meeting in Vienna. That will be one of
the items in the chair's  'very easy' basket. The planned EU reforms,
however, will be a bigger problem. The 15 member states want to reach an
agreement on this issue during a planned special summit meeting in March.
The EU has to become ready and prepared for new memberships by Eastern
European countries.

New Year's Eve revelling features numerous accidents and brawls
</H1>
There have been numerous accidents, fires and brawls during this New Year's
Eve's revelling. In Leipzig some 50 rioters set up barricades in the
streets and battled with police.
In the Upper Palatinate an intoxicated arms buff shot at his girlfriend
with a crossbow and threatened 10 other persons. He finally was arrested,
after he had broken a leg.
In the Hochsauerland district a 30-year old man sustained life-threatening
injuries after fiddling with gunpowder. Now the whole house is about to
collapse, following the explosion in the cellar.
All the same, police were full of praise for this year's mainly peaceful
end-of-year revelling. People had been disciplined while having a ball.

Mr Brie criticises PDS as lacking substance
</H1>
Mr Brie, member of the executive of the PDS party, criticised his own
party. In spite of the success at the federal election and having become
a partner in the coalition governing the state of Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania he thought that there were substantial shortcomings as far as
contents and strategies were concerned, when interviewed by the newspaper
BERLINER ZEITUNG. The party especially was unable to live up to its
manifesto's stipulation, namely that they would be left of the SPD.
The PDS would be a world-champion with words, but lacked the substance to
back them.

drastically, according to a remit that is expected to be passed next week
at the close-doors meeting in Upper Bavaria's Wildbad Kreuth. The remit

is already happening in Austria. Austria has capped immigration of
foreigners' dependents at 1000 persons/year.

</H1>
The four German hostages released in Yemen will arrive in Frankfurt/Main
tomorrow morning. Two of them said, when interviewed on TV RTL, that their
kidnappers had treated them according to the circumstances. However, shots
had been fired once while they had been on their way, and that had been the
most terrible moments. Today 9 British and 1 Australian tourists that had
been freed by a military commando, flew out from Sanaa to Paris.

Summons to be posted by email, too
</H1>
In Bavaria the courts of law are to use the Internet to speed up trials
and cut costs. Verdicts, proposals and summons may then get posted using
electronic mail instead of letters, according to Bavaria's minister of
justice Sauter. Currently Bavaria was spearheading a working-group
comprising federal and state officials who were looking at the required
procedural changes.

From the editors' desk
</H1>
As of 1 January 1999 the exchange rates of the euro to most of the
European currencies are set in stone, and will not fluctuate at all any
more. That's why we will skip them in the future. We will, however, quote
other exchange rates and economic indicators.
