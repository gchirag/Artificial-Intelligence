FDP leader: No tax increases
</H1>
FDP leader Wolfgang Gerhardt has vouched for that there will be no tax
increases to solve the current budget problems. In an interview with the
tabloid BILD Gerhardt said the Liberals would neither wiggle nor wobble on
this point. He rejected a delay of reducing the solidarity tax as much as
cuts in unemployment benefits.
Regarding the current budget problems Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt
called for privatization of more government companies. Rexrodt said the
budget pressure presents a unique chance to overcome hitches that have
obstructed privatizations so far.
FDP member of parliament Koppelin said the purchase of the Eurofighter jets

Federal government welcomes union proposal
</H1>
The Bonn coalition has welcomed the demand by head of German Federation of
Unions (DGB) Dieter Schulte for a basic reform of collective agreements by
region. The economics spokesman for the Union faction, Mr. Uldahl, said in
Bonn Schulte's proposal was a large step ahead. To fight unemployment old
taboos had to be broken. FDP economics expert Friedhoff called the
suggestions a hopeful starting point for employment politics. It remained,
however, to see whether Schulte's announcements were followed by actions.
In a newspaper interview the DGB leader had called on the unions to
radically change their thinking. Regional collective agreements must take
better into account the needs of individual companies.

jobs could be created. In this regard temporary employment as a springboard
would be better than no employment at all. The statement says further the
responsibility for employees and new jobs had again to be given higher
priority in the German economy than to satisfy stockholders with top
dividends.
