Court stops the deportation of the criminal Mehmet
</H1>
The 14 year-old Turkish serial criminal with the cover name
Mehmet cannot be deported for the time being. The Bavarian
Administrative Court explained today in its decision that the youth
has not yet had a legally valid sentence. The Supreme Court of
the Administrative Court decided that deportation of the known
serial criminal known as Mehmet is only valid when his parents
no longer legally reside in Germany. However, according to the
judges, the legality of the planned deportation of his parents is
seriously in doubt. They could then not be made responsible for
their son's behavior, which includes more than sixty criminal acts.
According to the judges, The inability to raise a child to become
a responsible member of society can not be equated with a serious
crime, which would be a reason to also deport the parents.
