Search for plane crash passengers continues
</H1>
The search is continuing for the passengers of the
planes which crashed off the coast of Namibia. It is thought that the
German 'Tupolew' plane collided with an American military plane and
crashed into the sea, but there is still very little known about the
cause of the collision. Up until yesterday evening, a steady stream of
pieces of the wreckage of both planes was being washed up out of the
sea, this makes it clear that the American plane must have crashed in
the same area of the Atlantic as the German Tupolew. The most
important piece of the wreckage found so far is a door with American
markings on it. No further bodies were found during the night, let
alone survivors; an autopsy was to carried out in Windhoek last night
on the only body found so far, that of the wife of a German crew
member. An American 'Hercules' aeroplane has been flying over the area
where the crash took place all through the night, but thick fog has
hampered the search operation along the Namibian coast. At present,
six planes are constantly criss-crossing the crash area; a Bundeswehr
(German Army) plane which is specially equipped for night searches
arrived in the area during the day. It is thought that all 33 people
died in the collision. This morning, the German Federal Cabinet
dedicated one minute's silence to the victims of the crash.

Ruehe wants crash search to continue to find as much as possible
</H1>
Volker Ruehe, the Federal Minister for Defence, intends to have
the search for pieces of the wreckage of the Luftwaffe's (German Aid
Force) 'Tupolew' plane, and the bodies of the passengers in it,
continue, so that as much as possible can be found. A spokesman for
the ministry has reported that the American and French navies have
been asked whether they can provide the necessary equipment. The most
important task, he continued, is to find the tupolew's flight data
recorder.

Leaked insecticide injures 170 people
</H1>
A kindergarten was affected today, when a bottle of highly
toxic insecticide leaked out, injuring 170 people, of which seven
children and one carer are still in hospital. The duty doctor has
announced that they are all doing well now, given the circumstances,
and no child is seriously ill. The police were informed when several
children began to complain of poisoning symptoms, such as headaches
and nausea. A big operation then began for the rescue services, as
over 170 people had to be found, some through the residents'
registration office at the town hall, and all had to be informed about
the situation and brought in for medical tests. It is at present
unclear how the poison got into the grounds of the kindergarten; the
police suspect that somebody threw the bottle into the kindergarten
from some neighbouring gardens. The public prosecutor's office has
taken up the case.

Waigel presents German design for Euro coins
</H1>
At a meeting today, the Federal Cabinet debated the designs for
the German versions of the eight Euro coins. The meeting unanimously
agreed the submitted designs, which are for the flipside of the coins
which Germany can decide itself, as will every other country which
prints and uses the coins. An eagle is to appear on the one and two
Euro piece - the other side will show the worth of the coin and a
stylised map of Europe. The eagle was designed by a Belgian artist,
and was chosen through a specially arranged competition. The
competition's jury decided on symbols which are specifically German,
and which can be recognised and understood by both the German and the
international public. The eagle was chosen for the one and two Euro
pieces as a traditional symbol of German sovereignty. A total of
twelve billion coins need to be pressed in the next three years,
before the currency is due to be introduced.

No VAT concession for "Candle in the Wind"
</H1>
The Federal Finance Ministry has no plans to waive the VAT on
the record "Candle in the Wind" by Elton John which has been
re-recorded in honour of Princess Diana, who died recently. Members of
the Bundestag (MdB's)from both the CDU/CSU and the SPD had said that
they think the ministry should not accept any of the 15 per cent Value
Added Tax (VAT) which it would get from the sales of the record.
Finance Minister Theo Waigel has said that he does not see any reason
to make an exception for the record. Lennerts, an MdB for the SPD has
said that he is outraged by the decision; he believes that the state
should not collect any tax for sales of the record, because all the
profits from it are going to charity and Gordon Brown, the British
Chancellor of the Exchequer ( = Finance Minister), has made a special
exception for this record, exempting it from VAT. Lennerts said that
it would be a nice gesture if Germany did the same. Jobst, an MdB for
the CSU, has also called on Waigel, a member of his own party, to
exempt the record from VAT, but Waigel does not agree, saying that it
would be very complicated to arrange, and that VAT is due to the
federal states, as well as the national government.

Santer says Euro three per cent deficit level is negotiable
</H1>
Jacques Santer, the president of the EU commission, has said he does
not think that the three per cent budget deficit level should be seen
as fixed in stone as a qualification for entry to the European common
currency. He said that all the talk in Germany around a very strict
interpretation of the state borrowing criterion was mistaken,
affirming that as long as the budget deficit was around the three per
cent mark, then that would be sufficient. He also said that he did not
believe that there was any reason to believe that the Euro would be
any less stable with a deficit of around the three per cent mark.
