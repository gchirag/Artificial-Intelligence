</H1>
Arbitrator Spoeri, who was trying to sort out things when award-talks in
Baden-Wuerttemberg's metal-industry hit a stalemate over plans for early
retirement/part-time work, agreed that they in fact seemed to have got
nowhere. And aggro and stress had got worse, too. A spokes-person for the
union agreed that they effectively were stuck. The main bone of contention
was and is if the agreement would get written into the awards, making it
compulsory for all employers concerned.

Serbian man sentenced to life-imprisonment
</H1>
The Dusseldorf Upper Regional Court sentenced a man from Serbia to life
imprisonment for war-crimes he had committed in Bosnia. The 50-year old man
was convicted of 11 cases of genocide, 30 murders and unlawful detention.
Allegedly he had played a major role in the killing of Muslims in 1992.
The court followed the public prosecutor's plea. Defence counsel had claimed
that the case was not within the court's jurisdiction, and wanted their
client released. The verdict stated that, as the crimes were particularly
grave, there would be no question of releasing the offender after 15 years
(on parole).
