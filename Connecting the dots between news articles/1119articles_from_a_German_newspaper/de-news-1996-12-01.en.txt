50 years Bavarian constitution
</H1>
The Bavarian Parliament and the State Government celebrated the
50th anniversary of the Bavarian constitution with a ceremony at
Ludwig-Maximilians University. State Premier Stoiber warned in his speech
that in a unified Europe the German states might be reduced to
administrative entities. The Bavarian constitution is a good example how
federalism can work, Stoiber said. This gave politicians the courage and
power to act independently in research, art and culture.
State Parliament President Boehm also acknowledged the women and men who
have worked out the constitution. As real democrats, they provided a model
for the defense of right, justice and human dignity. Boehm also stressed
that the Bavarians gave themselves their own constitution. On December 1,
1946 a wide majority of citizens voted for the constitution. Since the war,
the constitution has been changed six times; for example, guarantee of the
freedom of broadcast, environmental protection as goal of the state, and
local referendum have been added.
