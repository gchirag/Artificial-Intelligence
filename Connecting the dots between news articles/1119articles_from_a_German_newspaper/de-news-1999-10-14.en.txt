DASA and Aerospatiale merge
</H1>
DaimlerChrysler subsidiary DASA and the French company Aerospatiale Matra are
joining forces to create Europe's leading air and space company. This was
announced today by DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart. The new company will be
called EADS (European Aeronautic Defense Space Company). With its 89,000
employees, it is expected to show returns of 21 billion Euro. Daimler's chief
Juergen Schrempp spoke of a pioneering industrial contribution toward
Europe's unity.

<P>
The merger is considered the decisive step in reorganizing the Airbus
consortium, of which DASA and Aerospatiale are the largest owners. EADS will
be headquartered in the Netherlands and is expected to begin work in the
first half of 2000, after the appropriate agencies have approved the deal.

response. French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said that it was necessary to
order the powers anew in view of the general consolidation process.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder deemed the union "good for France, good for
Germany and good for Europe." The Airbus-Consortium also welcomed the merger
and hopes it will lead to new opportunities for the compact company.

Pension insurance companies satisfied with compromise
</H1>
The Association of German Pension Insurance Companies is satisfied with the
compromise forged by the federal government and the trade union IG Metall for
retirement at age 60. The pension system will not be burdened by costs for
financing early retirement, said Association Director Franz Ruland yesterday
evening in ARD-Television. However, it was going to be difficult, he added,
to predict how many positions would be re-filled. That would be a point for
employers and unions to negotiate.

<P>
Labor Minister Walter Riester and IG Metall chief Klaus Zwickel had already
agreed on a plan. To qualify for early retirement, a person must have been
making contributions to the pension fund for 35 years. The cost of pension
contributions would not increase to fund the early retirement scheme, rather
"tariff funds" collected from employees and employers would be established.
Zwickel plans to present the plan to the Labor Alliance ("Buendnis fuer
Arbeit"). Employers have already rejected the venture.

<P>
The Federal Pension Plan Agency for Salaried Employees (BfA) estimated that a
total of 850,000 working women and men born between 1937 and 1944 could take
advantage of early retirement.

Fugitive former GDR judge's Swiss bank account blocked
</H1>
A deposit in the millions made by a former GDR judge into a Swiss bank
account has been frozen. The Swiss news magazine "Facts" reported that the
account belonged to Juergen Wetzenstein-Ollenschlaeger, who was also the
former defense attorney for Stasi chief Erich Mielke. An international arrest
warrant was issued for Wetzenstein-Ollenschlaeger in 1992, but he evaded
arrest by fleeing abroad. Among other charges, he is alleged to have
embezzled 17 million DM from "Commercial Coordination" (Kommerzielle
Koordinierung), a GDR state-owned company run by Schalk-Golodkowski.

Compromise on book pricing policy expected
</H1>
The EU Commission has promised a compromise in the dispute over the book
pricing policy. Culture Commissioner Reding said in an interview with "Die
Welt" newspaper that Europe should not destroy proven structures in its
harmonization frenzy and that the problem cannot be solved with a crowbar.
Federal State Minister of Culture Michael Naumann also expects the new
Commissioner for Competition Monti to yield on book pricing policy. The
former Commissioner for Competition van Miert wanted to abolish fixed book
prices in trade between Germany and Austria. Book dealers and publishers fear
that fixed book prices within Germany would then also be discontinued.

Grass rejects Lafontaine's conciliation offer
</H1>
Guenter Grass, this year's Nobel Prize winner for literature, was the main
attraction today at the Frankfurt Book Fair. Before journalists, Grass
rejected the latest conciliation offer made by former SPD chairman Oskar
Lafontaine. While introducing his book "Das Herz schlaegt links" ("The Heart
Beats on the Left") yesterday, Lafontaine made a peace offering. After
Lafontaine's public break with the SPD, Grass had broken off their friendship
saying, "Shut up, drink your wine." Today Grass said his opinion had not
changed.
