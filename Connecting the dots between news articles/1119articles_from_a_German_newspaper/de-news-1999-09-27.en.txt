CDU Strongest Party after Municipal Elections
</H1>
The CDU is the winner of the municipal elections in Northrhine-Westphalia and is
now the strongest party in the Ruhr area. The SPD succeeded only in a few
cities. The election turnout was mostly lower than 14 days ago, and the SPD
could only partially stop its free fall. The SPD-candidates succeeded in
Dortmund, Wuppertal, Bottrop and in Bonn, but only with a small majority. In
Cologne, the state’s biggest city, and Duesseldorf, the state’s capital, and
sensationally in Gelsenkirchen, the CDU-candidates won and affirmed the results
of the main elections two weeks ago. With 50.3% the CDU became the strongest
party in the local parliaments between Rhine and Ruhr, leaving the SPD clearly
behind with only 33.9%. Like in Bonn, the Lord Mayors of the SPD now partially
will have to rule facing a civil majority. For the CDU-State Chairman,
Ruettgers, the result of both ballots is a great success. He called the CDU the
party of the Ruhr area. SPD-State Chairman Muentefering said, the Social
Democrats are still there, they would not kneel down or not disappear.

meeting in Berlin, the designated Secretary General, Muentefering, said that the
party is deeply disappointed. But he rejected demands to exclude Lafontaine from

mentions that the so called education and promotion remuneration are against the
free choice of a job. The BGH decided in favor of the third league football club
