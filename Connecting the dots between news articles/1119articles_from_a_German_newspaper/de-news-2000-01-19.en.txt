CDU donations affair: More pre-1993 mystery money
</H1>
One of the deputy leaders of the CDU, Christian Wulff, is saying that the
final report by the team of auditors investigating the donations affair can
be expected to reveal the existence of a further 9 million D-Marks of
unclear origin. The funds arrived in CDU accounts prior to 1993. The party's
Secretary-General, Angela Merkel, told ARD television that there was some,
in any case, additional unaccounted-for income. She also said that former
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was the only one who could clear up the matter. Kohl,
meanwhile, speaking to the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, reaffirmed his
intention to keep the promise he made to those who gave him around 2 million
D-Marks in cash donations between 1993 and 1998, not to reveal their
identities.

CDU donations affair: More money from Swiss bank account to Hessian CDU
</H1>
According to Premier Roland Koch of Hesse, there have been more fund
transfers from a secret Swiss bank account to the state's CDU party
apparatus than previously revealed. Koch told the "Frankfurter Rundschau"
newspaper that account movements in the party's books had caught his
attention, apparently cash donations being entered as "other income". Koch
said the party books were kept in the office of former CDU tax advisor Horst
Weyrauch. According to newspaper reports, Weyrauch was also responsible for
the auditing of the books. Koch said the situation "needed clarification".

Flight affair: Witness contradicts Rau and Schleusser
</H1>
The parliamentary investigation committee looking into the North
Rhine-Westphalia "flight affair" has heard Sabine Wichmann as its first
witness, the widow of the PJC airline chief pilot. Wichmann contradicted
accounts from Federal President Johannes Rau and North Rhine-Westphalia
Finance Minister Heinz Schleusser. She spoke of several private flights by
the politicians. The Westdeutsche Landesbank (West/LB) chartered and - at
least in part - paid for PJC jets, on which the politicians flew. Rau's
lawyers had issued a statement saying that Rau did not take any flights paid
for by West/LB during his tenure as Premier of North Rhine-Westphalia.

IG Metall union wants 5.5% more in 2000
</H1>
The North Rhine-Westphalian branch of the IG Metall union is demanding 5.5%
more pay for its 750,000 members in the current contract negotiations. The
largest of the regional union branches has thus accepted the recommendation
of the union's federal executive. It is also calling for allowances for
early retirement for aged workers. The chief negotiator for the branch,
Harald Schartau, said in Bochum that the demand for an "employment bridge"
had nothing to do with the "retirement at 60" negotiated within the
framework of the federal Alliance for Work.
The metals union branch in the region of Bavaria was the first to adopt the
demand for 5.5% in 2000.

More government talks on nuclear withdrawal
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and ministers within the SPD-Green
coalition have completed the discussion on their position in further
negotiations regarding the decommissioning of nuclear power plants.
Government spokesman Uwe-Carsten Heye reaffirmed the government's desire for
an amicable agreement with the plant owners. The primary concern at the
talks was to determine how soon a legally-enforced shutdown could come into
effect, in the event that a step-by-step withdrawal cannot be negotiated
with the industry. The Greens demand a maximum lifespan of 30 years for the
plants. The next meeting with the chief executives of the 4 leading energy
companies is scheduled for February 4.

Opposition criticizes eco-tax in Bundestag
</H1>
Just three weeks after its implementation, the four-stage eco-tax has again
become a bone of contention between Government and Opposition in the
Bundestag. The CDU/CSU and FDP spoke of "picking the pockets of the driving
public". They called the plan unconstitutional, socially unfair, and
ecologically ineffective. The Premier of the Saarland, Peter Mueller, and
CSU representative Hans Michelbach called upon the Government to withdraw
the reform. The Deputy Finance Minister, Karl Diller (SPD), rejected the
suggestion. He said that the Government did not expect a legal suit by the
transportation industry, or similar challenges, to have any chance of
success in reversing the tax.
