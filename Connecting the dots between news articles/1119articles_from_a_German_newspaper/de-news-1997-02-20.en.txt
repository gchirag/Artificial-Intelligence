Waigel demands concerted action for growth and employment
</H1>
 Finance Minister Waigel has called for a concerted effort for
economic growth and employment, with the participation of all sections of
society.  He said it now depends on the willingness of the Social

Schaeuble, has voiced his readiness to accept compromises on the taxation
of night and Sunday labor.  He said he was willing to discuss socially
compatible steps with the SPD.

</H1>

Court, with the aim of forcing the parliamentary plutonium committee to
accept new evidence.  Using their parliamentary majority, the CDU/CSU and

surrounding the smuggling of plutonium from Moscow to Munich in 1994 and
to clarify the role of the German Intelligence Agencies in the case.

Bundesbank demands swift reforms
</H1>
 The Federal Bank has demanded speedy reforms to gain
control over the economic difficulties in Germany.  The latest monthly
report issued by the monetary watchdogs in Frankfurt states that current
measures are probably insufficient to rectify all structural problems.
The economic uptrend still lacks self-sustaining dynamics.  High
unemployment and sluggish growth could jeopardize Germany's membership of
the European Monetary Union.  President Tietmeyer of the Bundesbank called
on federal, state and municipal governments to introduce stricter controls
on spending.

No consensus in dispute over postal monopoly
</H1>
 The dispute between government and SPD over the monopoly of the
Postal Service is nowhere near a resolution.  In the Bundestag debate
today, the opposition demanded that the monopoly be extended for an
indefinite period.  The governing coalition, however, is planning to
maintain the exclusive right of the Postal Service to transmit 80% of all
letters only through 2002.  During the preceding discussion of the annual
economic report, Finance Minister Waigel had called for a concerted effort
for economic growth and employment.  He announced further budget cuts and
measures to promote investments.

Experts pessimistic about the future of pensions
</H1>
 According to experts, pension contributions can be maintained at a
stable 20% only if the retirement age is increased from the current 65
years to 72 years.  The only alternative would be a drastic cut in pension
payments from 70% to 55% of the last salary, the newspaper "BILD"
reported, with reference to the National Association of German Pension
Insurers (VdR).  According to VdR, the government proposition to freeze
pension premiums at current levels would entail dramatic cuts in future
pension payments.

Herzog and Kohl pay tribute to the late Deng Xiaoping
</H1>
 Federal President Herzog and Chancellor Kohl have praised
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping as a grand statesman.  In his
telegram of condolence, Herzog wrote that Mr. Deng's reform course has
brought China great economic success.  His name also stands for the
opening up of China to foreign countries.  This policy has been a major
factor in establishing close and trusting relations between China and
Germany.  The Chancellor emphasized that Deng counts as one of the great
leaders in the more recent history of China.  His political policies
created the basis for the relations between Bonn and Beijing.  Mr. Deng
died yesterday at the age of 92.  His state funeral is scheduled for
Tuesday.

Bavarian Minister of Economics expects unemployment to fall
</H1>
 The Bavarian Minister of Economics Wiesshoy expects unemployment
figures for the state to fall between now and the middle of the year and
economic growth to increase.  A growth rate of 2.7% is a realistic figure,
he said at his annual press conference.  The favourable climate has been
created by low interest rates, stable prices and only moderate increases
in wages.  Export figures for Bavaria are still at record levels, with the
main customer being the United States.  Industry's reticence to make new
investments poses the biggest problem, Mr. Wiesshoy said.  With this in
mind, he called for the creation of better conditions, stressing the tax
reform as the single most important issue.  The Bavarian Bureau of
Statistics recently issued a report stating that GDP rose by 2.0% last
year, after an increase of 1.6% in the previous year.

Death of 14-year-old Sabine solved
</H1>
 The death of the 14-year-old schoolgirl Sabine at a ski-camp in
Austria has been solved.  The public health department in Lauf stated that
the girl's fatal illness was caused by a virus infection, linked to the
bacterium Staphylococcus aureus.  This was confirmed by micro-biological
tests.  If, as in Sabine's case, the virus infects a weak immune system,
then the consequences can be fatal.  The 14-year-old girl from Altdorf
near Nuremberg died two weeks ago at a ski-camp in the Austrian town of
Saalbach.  Many of her fellow class mates also became very ill from the
infection.  It was at first suspected that the teenagers had a legionella
virus infection, but this theory was dismissed after an analysis of the
drinking water in Saalbach.
