Attacks on railway lines
</H1>
At three attacks of railway line in Lower Saxony, the
electric overhead cables have been damaged this morning. In all three
cases investigators have found hooks that had been thrown on the
cables, as militant anti-nuclear activists used to do in earlier attacks
on railway lines during protests against so-called Castor transports

Commissioner for the Armed Forces: Right-wing incidents quadrupled
</H1>
The number of right-extremist incindents in the Bundeswehr [the
German Armed Forces] has quadrupled to a total of 177 in the past year,
according to the annual report of Parliamentary Ombudsman for the
Armed Forces Claire Marienfeld. In the report, Ms Marienfeld also voiced
concerns on the increase of drug abuse and of excessive drinking by
troops. The Ombudsman criticised as well the fact that in cultivating its
tradition the Bundeswehr does not always observe the due distance to
the Wehrmacht [the German Armed Forces in WW II].

<P>
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe repudiated the latter criticism. Mr Ruehe
said Ms Marienfeld gave a wrong impression [of the state of the
Bundeswehr to this respect] that he protested against. He added that
he will not change the decree concerning the cultivation of traditions
in the Bundeswehr.

Fourth bargaining round in public services sector
</H1>
Before the beginning of today's fourth round of collective
bargaining in the public services sector, head of the union for
public service and transportation (OeTV) Herbert Mai has said that
he expected the employers to make their proposals in this round.
Otherwise he would let the talks break down. Mr Mai also warned the
employers against link their proposals to any conditions.

<P>
Just before the beginning of today's talks, Federal Interior Minister
Manfred Kanther said the employers would only make concrete proposals
if it was clear for them [that is the Federal state, the individual
states - Laender -, and the communities] how the unions are going to
react to the proposals. Mr Kanther added it was important to him to
know what he will get on balance.

<P>
The talks are also said to be going to be about such disputed questions
as sick pay and additional pension benefits.

<P>
If the unions should let the talks break down employers intend to call
on a mediator. Before today's talks, warning strikes took place
throughout the country, with a total of 130,000 participants, according
to the OeTV union. The strikes mainly affected the states of Berlin,
Hesse, Saxonia and the Ruhr area, where millions of commuters were
late at work because of a break down in public transport. At Frankfurt
Airport, Lufthansa had to cancel 20 flights.

Preferential treatment of ethnic German repatriates from Russia legal
</H1>
Different regulations concerning ethnic German repatriates
from the former USSR and from other East-European countries, respectively,
do not violate the constitutional right of equality before the law,
according to the Federal Administrative Court. In several decisions
concerning the new repatriate bill, the Court ruled today that in the
contrary to ethnic Germans in the former USSR, ethnic German repatriates
from other countries would have to prove sufficiently that they had
beed subjected to considerable discriminations because of their
German nationality. The judges rejected a particular case of a plaintiff
from Poland whose parent and grand parents were expropriated after
the War.

DIW: Fed. Dept. of Statistics' budget deficit calculations correct
</H1>
The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) has withdrawn
its criticism of the official calculations of last year's budget
deficit [that are important with regard to European Monetary Union].
A spokesperson said today the DIW no longer doubts the figures published
by the Federal Deptartment of Statistics, fixing last year's budget
deficit at 2.7% [of the GDP]. For its own calculations of a budget deficit
of 3%, the institute had to use estimate numbers for the fourth quarter
of 1997. The real numbers for the fourth quarter, however, had been
drastically lower than predicted. The Federal government had decreased
considerably investment payments, and had sold state property on a big
scale. DIW's economists criticised this way of lowering the deficit as not
being sustainable.

All employees with an annual income of less than DM35,000 (or DM70,000

Bundestag as early as tomorrow. The government hopes that it can come
into effect as of January 1, 1999.
