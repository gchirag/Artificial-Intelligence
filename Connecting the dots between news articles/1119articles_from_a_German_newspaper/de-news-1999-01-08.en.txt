CDU-politicians to discuss dual citizenship
</H1>
Today the CDU-executive met behind closed doors,
overshadowed by the party-internal bickering about the reform of the law on
(dual) citizenship. Items on the 3-day event's agenda: finding out why
they lost the last federal elections, and determining what they were going
to do while in opposition. But the main item will probably be the planned
collection of signatures against a change to the citizenship laws, providing
for dual citizenship. As late as this afternoon, the CSU-party had asked
the CDU for a decision on this matter. Head of the CDU-party and their
parliamentary group Schaeuble asked for a decision in principle. He
thought that details then could be worked out with the sister-party (CSU)

Number of unemployed on the rise
</H1>
Winter caused the number of unemployed to rise above the 4 million mark -
for the first time since the change in government after the elections.
Head of the Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit) Jagoda put
the blame on the extremely cold weather, causing close to 4.2 million people
to be out of work as of December. The unemployment rate now stands at 10.9%,
up from 10.2%.

<P>
Reasons for the substantial rise: on the one hand, work-schemes for about
60,000 people finished in December; on the other hand, mainly construction
workers and others working outside had to go on the dole due to the very
cold weather conditions. Mr Jagoda, however, said that 1998 had been a good
year for the German economy. Economic activity had been better, and for
the first time since the re-unification of the two Germanies, more people
had been in employment. His forecast for 1999: number of unemployed down
by 200,000, also due to demographical factors: there will be more older
workers finishing up, and less younger people to go to work.

Federal government against child-labour
</H1>
Federal government appealed for more efforts against child-labour in
underdeveloped countries. Ms Uschi Eid, Greens Party, said that companies
and consumers would be able to do something for the children by channelling
their own purchasing. Many children have to work like slaves in
underdeveloped countries' sweatshops.

Incident at Biblis nuclear power-plant
</H1>
There has been an incident in section B of Hesse's nuclear power-plant at
Biblis. On Wednesday, operator RWE found radioactivity in a secondary
circuit, according to the Environment Ministry at Wiesbaden. They thought
that radioactive water had leaked from the reactor's core to the secondary
circuit via the steam-generator. Radiation had kept rising, and that was
why procedures for powering-up again after the revision, had been halted.

DaimlerChrysler introduces new remuneration system
</H1>
DaimlerChrysler AG has decided on a new remuneration system for their
top-managers. As of today, salaries for the approximately 250 top-managers
will consist of a fixed base-salary (25%) and a portion depending on how well
the company had been doing (75%). The latter can be in bonus-payments or
share-options. This would level the salaries between American (Chrysler) and
German (Daimler) managers.
