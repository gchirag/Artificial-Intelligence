Mr Prodi presents new cabinet of commissioners
</H1>
Future President of the EU-Commission Prodi presented his new cabinet in
Brussels, featuring among others Ms Schreyer and Mr Verheugen, both from
Germany. Mr Verheugen, SPD, is to look after the extension of the EU to
include new members, and Ms Schreyer, Greens Party, will be responsible for
the EU's budget. Mr Prodi announced an "era of change". The Commission's
reputation had taken a battering by accusations of corruption and nepotism/
waste. Commissioner for Agriculture Fischler got his job back, and former
Hong Kong Governor Patten will become Commissioner for External Affairs. The
19-member team still has to be confirmed by the European Parliament.

EU will take Mr Bangemann to court
</H1>
The EU will take former EU-Commissioner Bangemann, who previously had asked
to be relieved of his job, to court, because of taking up a job with a
Spanish telecommunications conglomerate. Diplomatic sources claimed that the
vote to take him to court had been unanimous. The EU wants to cancel his
entitlement to a monthly pension of approximately 14,000 marks. Mr Bangemann
had been responsible for telecommunications while working for the EU. Though
EU-lawyers advised not to proceed as the chance of winning was remote, the
EU went ahead all the same. The FDP-party, whose boss Mr Bangemann had been
earlier on, was critical of him but will not cancel his party-membership.

Ukraine insists on nuclear power generation
</H1>
The Ukraine keeps insisting on building two new nuclear power plants to
replace the ill-fated one at Tchernobyl. Chancellor Schroeder was unable to
convince the people he spoke to in Kiev, that an alternative solution using
coal and gas was better. President Kutchma (sp?) stated that Tchernobyl
would only be decommissioned when and if the West would honour their
financial pledges. According to Mr Schroeder, a decision on the nuclear
power plants will be made as late as in September. Then the European Bank
for Reconstruction will decide if they will provide finance for the project.

Upper House (Bundesrat) refers remits to select committees
</H1>
In their last session before the summer-recess, the Upper House (Bundesrat)
has not taken any stand on government's plans for reforming the pension
system. Remits by Hesse and Saarland were referred to select committees.
Both want to peg pensions to net wages, not the rate of inflation, as
proposed by government. After the summer-recess, Chancellor Schroeder will
tell the opposition and social interest groups to come to the party and give
a hand with reforms, according to an interview. General Secretary of the CSU
Merkel stated that she would be ready and prepared for a dialogue.

Berlin's referendum against spelling reform a flop
</H1>
Berlin's referendum against the spelling reform has been a flop. Only
108,000 people signed for it - out of a required 243,000. Schleswig-Holstein
probably will give in as well. Education Minister Erdsiek-Rave (sp?) stated
that the reform, that previously had been put on hold through a referendum,
would now go ahead. The CSU had also changed tack and decided that they were
no longer against the spelling reform.

Mr Stoiber against scrapping of ICE high-speed track project
</H1>
Bavarian State Premier Stoiber will try and join ranks with his Thuringian
colleague Vogel trying to get the ICE-track for high-speed trains from
Nuremberg to Erfurt all the same. Mr Stoiber stated in Munich that cancelling
the project meant that federal government also welshed on a promise given by
Germany to the EU. The track was part of a high-speed system Malmo-Rome.
The EU had already paid out 23 million marks for the Nuremberg-Erfurt
section, according to Mr Stoiber.
