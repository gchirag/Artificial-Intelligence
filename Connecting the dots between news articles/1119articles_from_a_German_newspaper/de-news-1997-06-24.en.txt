BVG provisionally voids Bavarian abortion act
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court (BVG) has stopped by an interim
order several special regulations of the Bavarian abortion law. Among other
consequences this will allow physicians specialised in abortions to continue
their profession, if they have been specialised in abortions since 1996 or
earlier. They will also keep the right to earn more than 25% of their
revenues
through abortions. Both would have been outlawed from Juli 1 by the Bavarian
abortion act.

<P>
The judges thus followed the argument that in the case the bill be declared
unconstitutional later, the disadvantages to physicians and affected women
would be to high. The judges, however, also said the suspension of the bill
is not aimed at protecting the economical interests of the physicians who
see their existence threatened. The reason is rather that the bill, at least
for the time being, does not help protecting life. The bill would not
provide for adequate medical care for women in Bavaria willing to procure
abortion.

<P>
The Greens, Social Democrats and the Pro Familia organisation urged Bavaria
to cancel the bill. Bavarian SPD leader Renate Schmid called the court's
decision a slap in the face of the Bavarian government.

<P>
The Bavarian government, however, is confident that the court will approve
the bill in the main hearing that is still to come. Bavarian State Premier
Edmund Stoiber said the bill would not be modified. This was not necessary
for the time being since the court approved the general conception of
the bill. He admitted, though, that the court's decision is still open.

<P>
After today's decision, two physicians who together procure more than half
of all abortions in Bavaria can continue their work to the same extend.
According to Bavaria's special regulations physicians would only be allowed
to earn a quarter of their revenues through abortions. Moreover, only
gynaecologists would be allowed to procure abortions. The final decision
of the court is not expected before automn. Until then, the Federal
Constitutional Court wants to find out whether Bavaria actually has the
right to enact an abortion bill.

Popular initiative to abolish Bavarian senat succeeds
</H1>
The popular initiative "Lean state without senat" has succeeded.
Now, the decision on the future of Bavaria's senat, the second house of
parliament, is with the people: since the matter concerns a change of
constitution a referendum will be held in any case. According to
preliminary results, 10.5% of all people entitled to vote, that is
930,000, have supported the initiative, almost 47,000 more than necessary.

<P>
Already before the publication of the provisional result, the CSU faction
leader in the Bavarian parliament, Mr Glueck, annouced an own bill to
keep but also to reform the senat. Among other things its composition
would be changed. Members of the senat would also get the right to
be heard in person at parlamentiary committee meetings.

<P>
The Bavarian senat is the only second house of a state parliament in
Germany. According to the alliance of OeDP, SPD, FDP and the Greens
supporting the initiative the senat was a superfluous assembly
of local dignitaries coming from different social groups, that
wasted several million mark of tax payers' money each year.

Waigel: go-ahead for Eurofighter
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to go ahead with the
"eurofighter" project. Waigel said the fighter airplane was absolutely
necessary for defense policy reasons. He had already talked to
airplane constructor DASA's CEO on the financing of the project.
Defense Minister Volker Ruehe, too, said the Bundeswehr (the German
forces) needed the eurofighter. However, the defense budget should
not be decreased for its financing. The Bundeswehr needed a  solid budget
providing for 340,000 troops.

<P>
During the budget talks on Thursday Mr Waigel and Mr Ruehe
want to discuss above all the financing of the eurofighter.
SPD financial expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier urged Mr Waigel
to make clear to DASA that it was impossible to buy the
airplanes. There was simply not enough money to do so.
Mr Waigel was not allowed to push through a project just to
please his party, Bavaria based CSU, that he had to reject
as a responsible Finance Minister.
<P>
For the acquisition of the fighter planes a total of
DM23b are needed. The eurofighter would be the most
expensive defense contract in Bundeswehr's history.

No settlement in bargaining dispute at Volkswagen
</H1>
Even after the second round of collective bargaining at
Volkswagen there is no settlement in sight between the company
and the IG Metall union. An IG Metall spokesperson said the main
point of controversy was still the financing of the old-age
part-time work scheme. The union demand from VW to financially top
up the payments required by law. According to the IG Metall union,
employees loose 18% of their pension when they take part in the
old-age part-time work scheme when aged 55 to 60.

Baby food containing pesticides to get approval
</H1>
Germany has lost the dispute regarding pesticide residues
in baby food. EU Agricultural Ministers passed a directive today
that allows other member states to file charges against Germany
when it does not allow the marketing of baby food from other member
states.

<P>
In Germany, no pesticide residues are allowed in baby food. Spain
considers the German regulations as being exaggerated and therefore
as being a handicap for Spanish producers on the Germany market.
Already in 1994, the two countries had a controversy when Spanish
baby food was taken from the shelves of German supermarkets for
containing pesticide residues.

<P>
German Agricultural Minister Jochen Borchert reassured that despite
the new directive baby food not meeting the German regulations will
not be allowed being marketed in Germany.
