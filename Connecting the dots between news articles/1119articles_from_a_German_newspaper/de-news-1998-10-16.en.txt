Parliament votes on involvement with NATO-strikes
</H1>
Starting this morning, the German parliament (Bundestag) is sitting under
urgency discussing this country's possible contribution to a NATO-strike in
Yugoslavia. Both outgoing and incoming governments visibly agreed on the
matter, so this afternoon's vote is expected to be free of surprises.
Foreign Minister Kinkel, speaking for the (outgoing) government, stated that
pressure on Yugoslavia's premier Milosovic must be kept up, and incoming
Chancellor Schroeder agreed: "Now there is a real chance of averting a
humanitarian catastrophe in the Kosovo region, as well as solving the real
political conflict at the heart of it. We know, ladies and gentlemen, and
this has to be said, that our country could easily become the target of a
huge wave of refugees. We Germans have put up 300,000 refugees from Bosnia.
We're not being callous saying that even *we* could become overloaded. And
that's why we've got a vital interest in peace and stability, also and
especially for the Balkans.

<P>
This afternoon, the NATO-Council will meet again. Allegedly they will
extend the deadline for giving the go-ahead for air-strikes. So far
time would be up tomorrow.

<P>
There has been a vast majority in parliament (Bundestag) in favour of
co-operating with NATO in possible air-strikes in the Kosovo region,
viz. 503 ayes (out of 584). Last week members of almost all the parties
in parliament had agreed, that only the threat of military actions
would be able to change Mr Milosovic's adamant attitude towards the
majority of the population in the Kosovo region.

<P>
Regardless of second thoughts some Greens party members might have had,
Foreign Minister designate Joschka Fischer clearly backed parliament's
resolution: "The problem is that the Milosovic policies - and I'm not
saying the policies of the Serbian people, it's the Milosovic policies -
constitute a permanent threat of triggering a war in Europe, and we can't
accept that."

</H1>
They may apply for early retirement once they turn 55. Today the Upper
House (Bundesrat) approved a decree for a top-up, guaranteeing them 83% of
their last net-salaries. This only applies to federal public servants; the
states may do as they wish.

Another Mercedes blackmailer
</H1>
The blackmailers want several million marks, according to a spokesperson
of the biggest German company. They threatened to attack Mercedes vehicles
and had already done so last Sunday in the Neuss district: two
paving-rocks allegedly had been thrown from a motorway overbridge. The car
was damaged but the driver unhurt (yet scared).

Telekom cheated out of millions' worth of toll-calls
</H1>
Police in Lower Franconia have discovered a lab where telephone cards were
manipulated. They had modified them in a way so they could be used for
unlimited calls, never depleting their initial nominal value of 50 marks.
A total of 40 of these fake cards had been impounded in Bavaria since
December 1997, amongst other cities in Schweinfurt, Munich and Augsburg.
It took the 'Squad To Fight Organised Crime' to catch them, in the basement
of a flat in Lower Franconia's Kitzingen. At the time, the perpetrator
had already left the premises, but police followed a hint and had the
45-year old man arrested in Ibiza/Spain.

Mr Noeth taken to court
</H1>
Former director of the state parliament of Bavaria has been taken to court
for fraud. The public prosecutor charged him with having defrauded
investors to the tune of half a million marks, using a so-called
pyramid system. The accused refutes the claims and considers himself to be
a victim, rather than the offender.

Passenger vehicles getting more and more wobbly
</H1>
In Germany almost every 9th passenger vehicle has problems with their
shock-absorbers, constituting a safety-risk when being driven. The companies
doing warrants of fitness for cars, TUEV and DEKRA, have discovered that
this gets worse and worse when the mileage goes up, which would be mainly
true for company cars doing lots of kilometres. That's why they asked for
better checks on shock-absorbers. The reason being: Deficient
shock-absorbers require longer distances for braking, reduce stability while
going through bends and increase the risk of skidding on wet surfaces
('aqua-planing').
