Train track Hanover-Berlin opened
</H1>
Germany's railway company Deutsche Bahn has opened the first high-speed
tracks in the eastern states. The new tracks between Hanover and Berlin
[where trains can travel at 250 km/h or 155 mph] cost 5 billion DM plus 3
billion for the investments in the Berlin rail infrastructure. The first
ICE train to travel between the cities was named after Resistance fighter
Claus Graf Stauffenberg. The time for travels between Hanover and Berlin is
up to one hour shorter on the new tracks. Environmental group BUND welcomed
the project but called on Deutsche Bahn not to build more high-speed tracks
but to improve the existing network.
