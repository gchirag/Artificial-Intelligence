Chancellor Kohl to talk turkey about civil rights in Indonesia
</H1>
When visiting Indonesia, Chancellor Kohl is to talk turkey as far as human
rights are concerned, according to a resolution passed by opposition parties
and civil rights groups. Politicians of the SPD and the Alliance 90/Greens
parties asked for that in a reaction to the award of the Nobel Peace Prize.
The society for peoples at risk asked the chancellor, to put an immediate
stop to military aid for Indonesia. Chancellor Kohl will visit Indonesia
while travelling to Asia from 25 October to 2 November. He also plans to
visit the Philippines and Japan.

Parliament decides on pre-trial detention
</H1>
Today the government coalition parties passed a law introducing
detention before the main trial into German criminal law procedures. This
would enable courts to detain offenders caught red-handed immediately, in
case they are likely to be sentenced to a maximum of one year's prison and
if the main trial (as opposed to the depositions hearing) is to begin
within a week.

<P>
This form of detention is a mitigated form of remand. In the future, an
offender may be detained for a maximum of 7 days if the judicial side of
things is clear, it is likely there will be a quick sentence and if formal
remand would not be commensurate with the offence committed. Left- and
right-wing so-called chaos-tourists would fit the criteria, as spokespersons
for the CDU/CSU parliamentary group explained.

<P>
A bit of background: two years ago a decision was made to speed up trials,
but the measures lacked bite as many offenders did not turn up at the trial.
Opposition spokespersons claimed the amendment was controversial as far the
constitution was concerned. And things were not obvious and clear as far as
the above-mentioned offenders were concerned, thus voiding the conditions
for detention and fast-track trials.

Question- and answer-time on wage-dumping
</H1>
Today the SPD-party asked for a debate, in parliament, on the law to block
wage-dumping on German construction sites using seconded foreign workers. As
the ministry still was unable to agree on minimum wages, this law will remain
a paper-tiger. According to the SPD, the ministry has not done their job yet,
and wants them to amend the existing law. The minister said no, as that
would mean infringing on the autonomy of award-partners. "We do not want to
set minimum-wages by decree, and we do not want government to decide, in
case of litigation, what the wage should be." He asked employers and
staff to agree to the already settled minimum hourly pay-rates of 17 marks
for West Germany and 15.64 marks for East Germany. Employers want to cancel
this agreement as early as of May, whereas the unions would only accept a
31 December 1997 deadline, at the earliest. The latter claim that they need
time to check if this would really help German construction workers.

Parliament to get smaller
</H1>
In 2002 the Federal parliament will be reduced to 598 seats, according to
draft legislation passed by the governing coalition parties. This was mainly
uncontroversial, though there are some differences of opinion between
government and opposition parties about the eventual compensation of
so-called overhang seats.

21,000 petitions to parliament
</H1>
Last year, parliament's commission for citizens' complaints
(Petitionsausschuss) received more than 21,000 petitions. According to
the commission's president Nickels, of the Greens Party, these days, when
there is no money in the till and economic and social problems are getting
bigger, this commission is becoming more and more important for the general
population. This would also explain the strong rise in petitions as far as
superannuation and health were concerned.

Law on work-schemes amended
</H1>
The coalition parties agreed to changes to the controversial law to boost
employment, according to the Federal Ministry for Labour in Bonn. In the
future, staff employed on work-schemes will only get 80% (currently 90%)
of comparable award-rates, and any exemptions where subsidies can top them
up to 100% will be limited. And now there will be a cap on monthly maximum
pay for people on work-schemes: 4130 marks in West Germany and 3500 marks
in East Germany.

Ex-FRG police-officers may be dismissed if they had co-operated with Stasi
</H1>
Former German Democratic Republic police officers can be dismissed if there
is proof that they also worked for the then Secret Police (Stasi), according
to a recent ruling by the Federal Labour Court (Bundesarbeitsgericht) in
Kassel. Having implicitly agreed to working for them would be sufficient;
there was no requirement for an explicit contract. Case in point: a Berlin
CIB-police officer had been re-employed after re-unification, but dismissed
later on because of his former involvement with the Stasi.

Cost of living up 1.4% compared to last year
</H1>
In September the cost of living in Germany was up 1.4% compared to last
year's figures, while it dropped .1% compared to the month of August,
according to the Federal Department of Statistics. This means that
inflation is at its lowest level since re-unification in 1990.

Arrest of alleged perpetrators of 1986 bomb-attack on Berlin disco
</H1>
More than 10 years after the disco La Belle had been the subject of
a bomb-attack, police have arrested two more suspects. A 37-year old German
female is to have planted the bomb in the disco, under instructions from her
then husband, a man born in Palestine. They both are accused of murder and
having caused an explosion, and there was fresh evidence to prove it,
according to the state prosecutor. Two American soldiers and a woman had
been killed when the disco La Belle was blown up in April 1986. The Berlin
authorities now also issued arrest-warrants for former staff of the Libyan
embassy in the (former) German Democratic Republic, who are alleged to
have helped with preparations for the attack. As early as in May,
Palestinian Yassir Hedi, who is state-less, was extradited to Berlin. He is
alleged to have been one of the people pulling the strings behind the scene.
