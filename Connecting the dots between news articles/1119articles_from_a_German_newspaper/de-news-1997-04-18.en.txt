Parliament (Bundestag) discusses spelling-reform
</H1>
50 members of parliament - across all parties - had submitted a
petition to stop the reform. Some argued reformed spelling would favour less
thinking, come across as flat and unsophisticated, and violate people's
constitutional rights. Others claimed the state ministers of education had
simply been power-hungry when rail-roading the whole country into the
reform. Federal and state governments should ignore the new spelling.

First reading of new multi-media law in parliament (Bundestag)
</H1>
Minister of education Ruettgers stated that the law provided for
consumer-protection and -privacy, and made it harder to spread pornography
and texts glorifying violence. The SPD, however, thought the law did not go
far enough. Setting the wrong signals and blinkered money-saving policies
made sure Germany missed the boat by a good margin - technologically
speaking. Mr Ruettgers on schools: "Teachers aren't really into it yet,
only 20% of them even want to look at it. That's got to change, so a
teacher's job description will never be the same again. They don't pass on
knowledge any more, in fact the kids know more than they do. But we still
need teachers to make young people competent as far as the new media are
concerned." Mr Thierse, of the SPD, pointed out that this would bear some
risks: "We're running the risk of getting a new class-system: some kids are
from families who use computers, are on the Internet and up with the play,
but the majority will only have a TV-set and a video-recorder, and that's
it for them."

Talks on energy finish without concrete results

still be required for a few more years.

Superintendents of SDR and SWF positive about amalgamation-treaty
</H1>
The superintendents of Suedwestfunk and Sueddeutscher Rundfunk,
Messrs Voss and Fuenfgeld, were positive about the treaty amalgamating the
two radio and television companies. Details, however, were in for criticism.

<P>
Mr Voss acknowledged the fact that the state premiers of
Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg respectively had managed to
come up with a treaty in such a short time, was quite an achievement.
They had, however, gone too far in some respects, for example determining
programming was the stations' job, not politicians'. They also had a few
niggles about demarcation, and reserved the right to appeal to the
Constitutional Court after having had a more thorough look at the legal
side of things.

Somewhat vague plans for extending NATO to include Eastern countries
</H1>
At the beginning of July, NATO will host a summit meeting in Madrid and then
decide which of the former Communist countries they will want to talk to
about becoming members. Chechia, Hungary and Poland are the most likely
candidates. In Bonn Poland's premier Kvasnievski confirmed that his country
wanted to become a member of NATO and the EU as fast as possible, thus
sharing the West's set of values.

<P>
Poland does not want to become a second-class member, according to the
premier, she should be on an equal footing with the other EU-members.
Mr Kvasnievski referred to Russia's demand not to house any additional
weapons or armed forces on the new members' territories. The general
expectation is that NATO will invite Poland, Chechia and Hungary to
negotiations about their prospective membership in July. A year later
Poland's premier expects his country to begin negotiations with the EU.
He expects Poland to become a member in 2006.

<P>
The Ukraine's minister for external affairs, Mr Udovenko, said in Bonn that
he was confident Germany would back a special agreement with NATO.
Negotiations between him and NATO General Secretary Solana are expected to be
finished at the end of May. The Ukraine did not want to extend her relations
with Germany and other Western European nations to the detriment of Russia,
yet wanted their ties to NATO and the EU to be as close as possible. The
Ukraine has finalised a co-operation agreement with the EU, and this
agreement is to be extended into a free-trade agreement within the next
years.

Interim report on police-reforms in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
There will be less staff at regional police head-offices yet more
at the coal-face in Baden-Wuerttemberg, according to the minister who was
presenting an intermediate report on police reforms. More police on the beat
and on motorways would fight organised crime more effectively. The 5
regional head-offices would concentrate on co-ordination, controlling and
providing service functions in the future. And they will be able to make
their own decisions on how the vote for police will be spent. Part of
police-owned workshop functions will also be contracted out.
