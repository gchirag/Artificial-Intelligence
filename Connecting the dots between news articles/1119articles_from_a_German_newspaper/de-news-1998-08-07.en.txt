Sneak preview of so far unpublished CDU/CSU election paper
</H1>
The governing CDU/CSU parties apparently came out strongly in favour
of cutting down on immigration, according to a so far unpublished party
paper. According to the newspaper RHEINISCHE POST, the paper stated that
whoever wanted more people to enter and settle in our densely populated
country, would put internal stability and peace at risk. Illegal immigrants
should only receive the bare minimum, according to the report. The paper
apparently also was against dual citizenship. If someone wanted to take
out German citizenship, they would have to give up their former
one

Mr Schaeuble thinks he's up to becoming Chancellor Kohl's successor
</H1>
Head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group Schaeuble refuted speculations
he would not be available as successor to Chancellor Helmut Kohl any more.
In an interview with the news magazine DER SPIEGEL, Mr Schaeuble said that
he would be up to the job, in spite of being a paraplegic. Previously his
wife Ingeborg had remarked in an interview that she had some doubts if the
German public would accept a Chancellor in a wheelchair, sparking the
current debate.

Mr Seehofer gets his way
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Seehofer got his way as far as one important
item in the row about inflated dental fees was concerned. The Dentists'
Association declared, after Mr Seehofer had leaned on them, that they were
prepared to inform their members about the rules on ceilings for fees.
They are now complying with an obligation Mr Seehofer already had stipulated
as early as at the beginning of June, which - according to the minister -
was important for the patients, some of whom had almost lost all faith in the
system.

Mr Schroeder on future coalitions
</H1>
If the SPD's candidate becomes Chancellor in the upcoming elections,
the Greens will be the first Mr Schroeder will want to talk to about forming
a coalition government. Only in case they could not come to an agreement,
would he start talking to the CDU/CSU parties straight away. As he reiterated
from his holiday home on the island of Borkum/North Sea, he would rather deal
with Defence Minister Ruehe than head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group
Schaeuble - if there was to be a big coalition (between SPD and CDU/CSU).
