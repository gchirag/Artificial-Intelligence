The department store chains Karstadt, Hertie and Kaufhof have pulled
soccer jerseys made by the US manufacturer Nike off the shelves
because they possibly contain highly toxic heavy metal compounds. At
Nike, the investigation is in high gear. ARD Television's magazine
show "plusminus" reported yesterday that Borussia-Dortmund shirts
contained a chemical called TBT (tributyltin). In animal tests, TBT
caused liver and nervous system damage. Scientists fear that this
compound can lead to masculinization in women and infertility in men.
According to the Institute for Consumer Protection (Bundesinstitut
fuer den Verbraucherschutz), nothing definite could be said about
possible harmful effects because the concentration of the toxic
substance in the affected clothing is unknown. The institute did say
that because the substance is highly soluble, it would wash out of the
clothing after several launderings.
