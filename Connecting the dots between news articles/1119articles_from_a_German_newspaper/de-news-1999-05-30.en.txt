NATO fighter jets are reported to have bombed a bridge
in Central Serbia this morning [Sunday]. According to Yugoslav sources,
at least 11 people died in the attack and another 40 were injured. It is
not clear if these people were civilians. NATO spokesman Mr. Shay said in
Brussels that an investigation is under way. He said that the bombings
could not be terminated as there are still no signs that show that
Yugoslav President Milosevic is planning on giving in. NATO will not, in
Mr. Shay's words, offer Mr. Milosevic pieces of sugar in the talks.

Dispute in health service
</H1>
German Minister of Health Andrea Fisher is apparently trying to make
peace with doctors. A speaker of the Ministry of Health in Bonn said that
Ms. Fischer is planning talks within the next few days with the Federal
General Medical Council to be able to return to reasonable dialogue.
Disagreement had ensued from statements by Minister Fisher in an
interview in which she had accused doctors of intentionally prescribing
unnecessary medication in order to undermine attempts at reducing costs.
The President of the General Medical Council, Mr. Wilmar, and the Chief
of the Doctors' association "Marburger Bund", Mr. Montgomery, said that
this was a scandalous accusation and demanded a public apology of the
Minister.

Aftermath of fire catastrophe in Tauern tunnel
</H1>
One day after the fire catastrophe in the Tauern tunnel,
Austrian authorities fear that up to five people might have died in the
flames. There is no doubt about the death of a 27 year-old German, but
four more men are also said to be missing. The search for victims had to
be called-off in the afternoon because more concrete panels had fallen
from the ceiling and off the walls in the hot tunnel. The missing people
are one Greek, one young man from Kaernten, Germany, and two Swedes.
Criminal police are planning to begin their investigation tomorrow. The
catastrophe has provoked a discussion about the safety of tunnels. Franz
Muentefering, German Minister of Transportation has announced strict
safety controls in all German tunnels.
