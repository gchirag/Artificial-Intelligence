Subsidies for coal mining industry to be cut
</H1>
The Federal Government intends to decrease subsidies for coal mining from
currently DM 10 billion per year to DM 3.8 billion DM, by the year 2005 - a
figure given by the Minister of Economics, Mr. Rexrodt, after a meeting with
the head of the German Mining Union Mr. Berger and Chancellor Kohl.
Mr. Rexrodt added, however, that the final word on this issue has not been
spoken yet.  The Federal Government may absorb additional liabilities arising
from the special role of the state of Saarland with its large economic
dependence on the mining industry.  Another summit meeting regarding coal
subsidies is scheduled for the beginning of next week.  The Secretary of the
Chancellor's Office, Mr. Bohl, pointed out that the offer of DM 3.8 billion is
a generous and far-reaching one.  The government expects that the state of
North Rhine-Westphalia increase its contribution to the coal subsidies from DM
1.0 billion to 2.5 billion.  So far the state has only accepted to pay DM 1.2
billion annually.  Union chairman Mr. Berger expressed his disappointment
about the talks and said the proposal is not acceptable.  The envisioned cut
in subsidies, according to Mr. Berger, would cause a dramatic rise in
unemployment.

Tedious Discussion about reform of pension plans
</H1>
The Coalition partners, CDU/CSU and FDP, are split on the issue of pension
reform.  Internal sources have said the discussion were very difficult.  The
CDU executive board seems to push towards supporting the pension plan with DM
15 billion from tax money.  Apparently, a decrease in pension payments is now
out of the question.  The creation of a "family fund" using tax money, as
suggested by the Pension Commission, has been rejected.

FDP presents its own bill for pension plan
</H1>
The FDP has presented its own draft for the reform of the pension plan.  The
FDP spokes-woman for socio-political issues, Ms. Babel, explained that the key
proposal in the paper was for an income-related pension scheme with a stable
contributions rate of less than 20%.  Under the proposal, the current pension
level of 70% would gradually be lowered to 64%.  In order to achieve this
goal, the Liberals want to extend the coverage of both company and private
pension schemes.

SPD views statutory pension scheme as very important
</H1>
SPD chairman Mr. Lafontaine has stressed that the statutory pension scheme
will remain the central tenet of his party's policy towards old-age pensions.
Speaking at a party conference on this subject in Bonn, Mr. Lafontaine did
however express his support for a scheme which could be supplemented by
employer-provided contributions and by the private savings.  At the same time
he warned the coalition not to revoke the 'generation treaty' - a system based
on the principle that pension funds for retirees are generated by the working
population.

DIHT expects low levels of economic growth in the current year.
</H1>
The Council of German Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) is sceptical about the
prospects for economic development in the current year.  Speaking in Bonn, its
chief director, Mr. Schoser, said that a growth rate of only 2% was expected.
He stressed that the main problem was still low levels of demand on the
domestic market, and added that the current lack of investment was having a
detrimental effect on the economy.  A spring survey of more than 25,000 firms
has shown that approximately a third of companies will be investing less money
than in previous years.  Moreover, one in every three firms is striving for
job cuts, whilst only one in ten is planning to take on new staff.  There is
little prospect of change in the job market before the fall.

Kinkel criticizes Israel's settlement policy
</H1>
During his visit to Israel, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has supported
international criticism of Israel's settlement policy.  After talks with his
counterpart Mr. Levi, Mr. Kinkel said in Jerusalem that the Europeans consider
it a mistake to proceed with the housing project in the Arabic eastern part of
Jerusalem, because the legal status of Jerusalem is still unsettled.  While
Mr. Levi acknowledged Kinkel's advice, at the same time he underlined that his
government will go ahead with the construction.  In the evening, Mr. Kinkel
visited Hebron in the West Bank.  He called on the predominantly Palestinian
population and the Jewish minority to show tolerance.  Later, Kinkel traveled
to Gaza where he will meet with PLO president Yasir Arafat tomorrow.

Frankfurt Mayor ousts Green finance administrator Koenigs
</H1>
The mayor of Frankfurt/Main, Petra Roth, has dismissed Tom Koenigs of the
Green party from his position as the city's financial administrator.  Ms. Roth

local elections.  Economics administrator Mr. Glaser (CDU) will take over the
Finance Department.  Mr. Koenigs remains city administrator for environmental
issues.  He called his ousting a blow against the co-operation of all
democratic parties in Frankfurt city hall which had been declared as early as
the night of the election.

Wissmann wants to reduce costs for Transrapid high-speed train
</H1>
Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann wants to reduce costs for
construction and operation of the magnetic levitation high-speed train
'Transrapid'.  If the industry was committed to the project, Transrapid could
become a profitable enterprise, Mr. Wissmann told the daily newspaper
"Berliner Zeitung".  The Federal Government makes a conscious effort to to
limit the costs for construction and operation of the Hamburg-Berlin route.
The Minister suggested the costs could be reduced by competitive awarding of
contracts.

Glogowski demands an agreement on the future of nuclear energy
</H1>
Minister of the Interior of Lower Saxony, Gerhard Glogowski, demanded that a
political consensus on the future of nuclear energy be reached soon.  After
the transport of Castor containers, which was escorted at times by up to
30,000 policemen, had yesterday reached its destination at the Gorleben
interim storage facility, Mr. Glogowski said: "In the long run, one cannot
adhere to this form of energy generation despite the opposition of large parts
of the population.  That is number one.  Number two is, one cannot turn a
terminal storage facility, that for 20 years has been the symbol for
resistance against nuclear energy, into an interim storage facility.  This is
politically unreasonable."  Federal Minister for Environment and Reactor
Safety Angela Merkel pointed out that there will be other nuclear waste
transports in the future.

Deutsche Welle Radio might move to Berlin or Leipzig
</H1>
Germany's international broadcasting station Deutsche Welle [heard on short
wave and via satellite], "Deutsche Welle" may be moved to Berlin or Leipzig.
According to the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung", Minister of
Construction and Housing Klaus Toepfer will evaluate if those cities would be
suitable locations for the station.  The cities were suggested by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.  The reason for this consideration is the resistance of Deutsche
Welle workers to move from currently Cologne to Bonn where they were to take
over flood-damaged Schuermann building.
