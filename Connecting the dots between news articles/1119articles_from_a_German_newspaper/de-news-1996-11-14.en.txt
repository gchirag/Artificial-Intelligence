Premiums for pension plan increase
</H1>
The premiums for the pension plan will increase to 20.3% of the employees'
gross salary on January 1st, according to Federal Employment Minister Bluem.
In parliament, Bluem argued that declining revenues, caused by poor economic
performance, necessitate this move.  This year, the pension plan premiums are
at 19.2%.  The SPD expert for social policy, Mr. Dressler, spoke of a loss of
credibility of government policy made by the CDU/CSU and FDP who are
responsible for the fact that people have to work longer, but receive less
pension.

DGB not to postpone passage of statute
</H1>
The National Trade Union Federation (DGB) will not delay the enactment of its
new statute.  The delegates at the extraordinary national convention in
Dresden rejected corresponding requests with a vast majority.  Several unions
within the umbrella organization found that some articles of the new manifesto
are not sufficiently aggressive in tone.  Numerous requests for alterations
will still be discussed, however, before the final vote on Saturday.
IG-Metall [union for metal and electronics industries] chairman Mr. Zwickel
was heavily criticized for threatening to depart from the conference if these
requests were to be accepted.  In the preliminaries of the DGB convention,
several unions including the IG Medien [union for mass media], as well as the
unions for Postal Service and wood industry had voiced reservations against
the statute and demanded postponement.  In their opinion, the period of
consultations was too short.  In particular they criticized the draft's
fundamental acceptance of social market economy.

<P>
The DGB continued to define its role as a counterweight to employers and
corporate power, and as a warrior against the destruction of the social net.
The preamble proclaims the right to strike.  
<P>
The completely new statute will
replace the one from 1981.

SPD has criticized non-participation in international military mission
</H1>
The government's decision to not take part in an international aid mission to
help the refugees in Zaire has been criticized as premature by the SPD.  As
the deputy chair of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Verheugen, said on
"Saarlaendischer Rundfunk" radio, the details of the mission should have been
evaluated prior to making the decision.  He said the government's rigorous
refusal stands in contradiction to the Coalition's policy to have Germany
assume more responsibilities in the international handling of crises.
Vanguards of American and French troops have arrived in the Rwandan capital,
Kigali, today.  New fighting has been reported today in the vicinity of the

Parliamentary proceedings

Reform of immigration law passed
</H1>
Today, the Bundestag has responded with legislative measures to the violent
riots of militant Kurds this spring.  The bill, passed with the votes of
CDU/CSU and FDP, contains provisions facilitating the expulsion of criminal
foreigners.  An expulsion will also result if a foreigner is convicted of a
severe case of disruption of peace or of disruption of peace at an
unauthorized protest rally.  The parties of the Opposition had opposed the
Coalition's proposal.  During the parliamentary debate, the SPD representative
Ms. Sonntag-Wohlgast said the penal provisions of the government's draft are
inadequate.  She demanded clear regulations to help foreigners integrate in
society.  Member of Parliament Ms. Mueller, of Alliance 90/The Greens,
believes that the legal basis for aliens will worsen.  Representatives of SPD
and Alliance 90/The Greens criticized the reform and demanded clear models for
the social integration of aliens.
<P>
The spokesman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary
group, Mr. Marschewski, defended the bill.  Interior Minister Kanther reminded
the Opposition of their position during the Kurd riots this spring, when they
too had demanded that criminal foreigners be expelled as quickly as possible.
Previously, the FDP Secretary General Mr. Westerwelle had underscored his
party's demand to change the naturalization and nationality law.  Children of
foreigners living in Germany should have the opportunity to be integrated as
Germans.  
<P>
The change in immigration law has now to be passed by the
SPD-dominated Bundesrat.  It is expected that a mediation committee will be
called upon.

Budget subcommittee deals with budget proposal for 1997
</H1>
The budget debate has run into an argument between Government and Opposition
about the planned savings of 3 billion DM.  Therefore, all involved Ministers
are to be summoned before the budget subcommittee and demonstrate down to the
penny at which projects they want to cut funds.  The Opposition aims in
particular at avoiding cuts of one billion in professional re-training
programs.  It is, however, questionable if all Ministers will appear before
the committee, as was voiced in Coalition circles.  Subsidies for coal mining
will also be affected by the budget savings 1997.  According to
Deutschlandfunk radio, Economics Minister Rexrodt plans to trim these
subsidies to the same extent as other items in his budget.

Trial against four former members of SED politburo in Berlin
</H1>
In Berlin, in the trial against four former members of the SED [former state
party of the GDR] politburo the prosecution has requested that the suspension
of imprisonment, which had previously been announced by the 17th grand penal
chamber of the Regional Court, be revoked.  The prosecution demanded that the
arrest warrants for the former GDR head of state and party, Mr. Krenz, as well
as for Mr. Dolus, Mr. Kleiber, and Mr. Schabowski be executed.  The
prosecution argues that the risk of escape prevails, since all four of the
accused have to expect long prison sentences.  The Regional Court had
previously issued arrest warrants for the former members of the politburo, but
suspended their execution.  However, Krenz, Dolus, Kleiber, and Schabowski
have to surrender their passports.  In the eyes of the court, this would
contain the risk of escape.  After the arrest warrants were announced, Egon
Krenz repeated his opinion that he would not recognize any decision by a
federal court.  His lawyer said that the arrest warrants manifest that the
court folded under public pressure.  The fact that the arrest warrants were
suspended means for the accused that they will remain free, but are subject to
certain conditions.  They have to turn in their passports, have to remain in
Berlin or Brandenburg, and have to report to the police weekly.  Krenz,
Schabowski and the other members of the SED politburo are indicted for multiple
manslaughter and attempted manslaughter of border crossers.  The
Constitutional Court had come to a fundamental decision that such deeds from
the GDR era are punishable under the law of the Federal Republic of Germany.

heavy snowfall, uncounted cars started skidding and crashed into each other.
On all roads leading to Munich, traffic jams resulted; in the mountains scores
of trucks got stuck.  Freezing moisture troubled drivers in Northern Germany.
Several people were injured and one person died in accidents in Lower Saxony.
On the A64 freeway near Trier, ten people were seriously injured in a chain
