government's proposal in a closed-door meeting in Potsdam. Parliamentary

group of about 40 dissidents from within the parliamentary group had
threatened to vote against the bill if socially just changes were not made. A
reintroduction of the capital gains tax was absolutely out of the question
for the Chancellor. The issue of de-linking the development of net salaries
and pensions should also not be revisited. The vote in the Bundestag is
scheduled for October 29.
