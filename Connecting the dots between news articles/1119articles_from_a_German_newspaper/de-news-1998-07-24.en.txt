Last pending complaint against Euro shot down
</H1>
Now the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) ruled
against the last complaint, Mr Manfred Brunner's, against the
introduction of the Euro, the future common European currency. Reason:
Government and parliament were responsible for political and economical
judgments as far as the introduction of the new currency was concerned.
This was the last of a succession of failed complaints pending at the
Federal Constitutional Court. Mr Brunner, head of the Association of
Free Citizens, had already stated in May that he would invoke the
European Court in Brussels in case the Federal Constitutional Court ruled
against him.

Re-trial of alleged Luebeck arsonist
</H1>
The Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof) quashed the verdict in
the trial of alleged arsonist Safwan Eid (not guilty). As requested
by the family El Omari, there will be a re-trial, in Kiel (not far from
Luebeck). The Federal Court of Justice said that the Luebeck court had
committed a grave procedural blunder by not using all the evidence
available. Conversations between visitors to the remand prison and between
the Eid family and their brother Safwan had been bugged and taped. The
Luebeck court would have had every reason to use them as evidence, but chose
not to do so at the time.

Debate about radioactive mushrooms
</H1>
At the start of the mushroom-picking season, discussions flared up once
again about the contamination of mushrooms and berries. The Munich
Institute for the Environment recommended that even 11 years after the
Chernobyl catastrophe, children and pregnant women should skip mushrooms
and berries and rather go for their farmed equivalent. The Environment
Ministry, however, declared that there should not be a problem eating
'free-range' mushrooms
