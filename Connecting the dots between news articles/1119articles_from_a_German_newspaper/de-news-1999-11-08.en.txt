Jail sentences for Krenz, Kleiber, and Schabowski
</H1>
Egon Krenz, the GDR's last head of state and party boss, will go to
jail on charges of being responsible for killings at the former
German/German border. Almost exactly 10 years after the wall came
down, the superior federal court in Leipzig upheld the 6 1/2 year
sentence against the 62 year old politician pronounced by the Berlin
superior court.
The two members of the politbureau, Schablowski and Kleiber, were
sentenced to 3 years each. Krenz received the verdict apparently
unmoved, but his lawyer said Krenz was thinking of an appeal to the
federal constitutional court and the European court for huiman rights.
The three GDR politicians will not be jailed immediately, pending a
decision by the jail supervisory board of Berlin, after which they
will be imprisoned.
PDS voiced sharp criticism against the sentence. Krenz used the
expression "victors' justice".

(about 20%) of cost with a possible upper limit of DM 20.00. Bavaria's
SPD leader Ms. Schmidt called the document "antisocial" and accused
the CDU of trying to introduce a two- or three-caste health system.
