SPD in Northrhine-Westphalia has new leaders
</H1>
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Northrhine-Westphalia has
bid farewell to long-time State Premier and State Party President Johannes
Rau. During a special party convention in Duesseldorf, SPD Secretary General
Muentefering was elected as the new President of the State Party almost
unanimously with 98.7 percent of the vote.

<P>
In his speech, Mr. Muentefering professed his commitment to the red-green
coalition in Duesseldorf. He demanded discipline from his party. The
underhand fashion in which Social Democrats in Northrhine-Westphalia talk
about each other has to end, he said.

<P>
Economics Minister Mr. Clement was nominated as State Premier by 90 percent
of the delegates. He is due to be elected as the new chief of government by
the State Parliament on Wednesday. Even before his nomination, Mr. Clement
expressed his support for the coalition with the Green party in the most
populous German state.

<P>
According to the Secretary General of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU)
Mr. Hintze, the SPD has moved to the left with its two new leaders. Mr.
Muentefering belongs to the proponents of a collaboration between SPD and
the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), Mr. Hintze said, and Mr. Clement is
an enforcer of the red-green coalition .

Hoeppner: most members of PDS respect constitution
</H1>
In the opinion of Saxony-Anhalt's State Premier Mr. Hoeppner, most members
of the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) respect the German constitution.
Mr. Hoeppner said on Deutschlandfunk Radio that the PDS should not be lumped
together with the right-wing German People's Union (DVU), but seen instead
in the context of the history of the GDR. Because of its internal
contradictions, the PDS is still on the way to becoming a democratic party.
At the moment, the biggest mistake of the PDS is that it builds its policies
in the East on anti-West sentiments. Mr. Hoeppner defended his decision to
form a minority government tolerated by the PDS. A Grand Coalition would
have disappointed East Germans and caused the SDP to lose votes in the
general election.

<P>
In Madgeburg, Social Democrats will today consider the formation of a
minority government at a special party convention. Mr. Hoeppner wants to put
himself up for re-elction in the State Parliament on Tuesday. There is no
doubt about his re-election because the PDS has already promised its
support.

Public Service Union against reduction of overtime
</H1>
The Union for Public Service and transportation (OeTV) does not
support the plans of the Minister of the Interior, Mr. Kanther, to reduce
overtime in the public service sector. Mr. Kanther does not want to reduce
overtime, but payment for overtime, a OeTV spokesperson said. This would not
create new jobs.

<P>
Kanther wants to allow public service employees free time in exchange
for more than 38.5 hours worked per week, instead of an overtime allowance.

Geissler: CSU is moving to the right
</H1>
According to social politician Heiner Geissler, the Christian
Democratic Union (CDU) does not want the statements of the Christian Social
Union (CSU) regarding policies on foreigners to be included in a common
election program. Mr. Geissler said, the CSU's sentence "Germany is not an
immigration country" has already and for good reasons been rejected by the
CDU Board of Directors. Germans have to grant foreigners equal rights and
not discriminate against them.

<P>
Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party (FDP) Mr. Westerwelle also
accused the CSU of an alarming move to the right.  He said the CSU was
trying to outdo the slogans of Republicans and the German People's Union
(DVU).

Schroeder for agreement on nuclear power
</H1>
SPD candidate for the chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder wants to create a new
national consensus about nuclear policy if he wins the election. The latest
debacle about the Castor transports has made it clear that the government
should have been open to the views of the SPD on the subject, Mr. Schroeder
said during the convention of the Northrhine-Westphalian SPD. The government
has been used by the nuclear industry over and over again.
At the same time, the SPD candidate for the chancellorship confirmed that
the new SPD State Party President Mr. Muentefering will get a Minister post
in Bonn if the SPD wins the October election. Mr. Schroeder said he was
thankful that Muentefering will be on his team and is open to participate in
the new government.

Incident at Sellafield

According to the company which runs the plutonium reprocessing plant in
Sellafield (Britain), a fluid has leaked out of a defective pipe. The
company did not give details but refuted Greenpeace's claim that the fluid
was radioactive waste. The environmental organisation had declared that the

down because of the accident. Greenpeace accused the company of trying to
cover up the problem. The reprocessing plant is offline at the moment while
maintenance work is carried out.

GDR systematically covered up deaths on German-German border
</H1>
The GDR always tried to cover up deaths and injuries along the inner
German border, according to a document of the East German secret police
(Stasi) which has just come to light. If people trying to flee were killed,
only their immediate relatives were informed. The Stasi was charged with
making sure that the public did not get word. No memorial services could be
held for fugitives who were killed; they had to be buried with the simplest
of funerals.

The President of the Christian-Democratic Employees' Association Mr.
Eppelmann has voiced his support for Richard Schroeder (SPD) as the next
German President. It is time that someone from East Germany is voted into
this position, Mr. Eppelmann said in Bonn. A vote for the historian and

the CDU politician stressed.

EU Commission against Kirch-Bertelsmann merger
</H1>
The planned merger of the media groups Kirch and Bertelsmann for digital
subscription television seems to have been definitively rejected by the EU
Commission in Brussels. Several news agencies have reported with reference
to Commission circles that approval is unlikely to be granted. Both
companies have refused to make new proposals or to change their plans, and
as it stands the planned alliance is not economically viable. The original
application for the merger was rejected some time ago by EU Commissioner for
Competition Mr. van Miert. The Commission will make its decision official on
Wednesday.
