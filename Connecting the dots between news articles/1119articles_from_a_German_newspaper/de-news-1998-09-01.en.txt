Despite judgement: "Republicans" still observed
</H1>
Baden Wuerttemberg's Department for the Tutelage of the
Constitution continues to observe the "Republikaner" ["Republicans", a
right-wing party]. The state's Ministery for the Interior informed
that an opposing judgement of a Berlin court will not change the
ministry's policy to this respect. According to the decision of the
court, Berlin's Department for the Tutelage of the Constitution is no
longer allowed to put the "Republikaner" under observation. In the
opinion of the court, the authorities have nothing to go by that
the "Republikaner" wanted to abolish the fundamentals of the constitution.
Several other German states had already stated that they would continue
the observation of the party. Just the state of Brandenburg wants to
reconsider its position.
