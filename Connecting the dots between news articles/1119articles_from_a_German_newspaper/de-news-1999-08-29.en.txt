Government pension plans
</H1>
Despite widespread protests, Federal Labour Minister Walter Riester and SPD
caucus leader Peter Struck do not expect any changes to the pension plans of
the red-green Coalition. Struck told Deutschlandfunk radio that he sees no
other way than to adjust pensions by de-indexing them for a period of two
years. (Until now, pension rates have been tied to the current wage
agreement in retirees' former industry.) Riester told the newsmagazine "Der
Spiegel" that he had had all of the alternatives carefully examined, and
that the results showed that the only solution to the pension problem was
the one he had suggested.

<P>
Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants the pension plan to be presented
to the Bundesrat together with his government's proposed savings package.
Bavarian Premier Edmund Stoiber reiterated his criticism of the plans. He
complained in Focus magazine that billions of Marks in debt were being
downloaded on the states and municipalities. He also charged that the
savings package would do nothing to create jobs, and would punish commuters.
The president of the Federal Association for German Industry, Hans-Olaf
Henkel, has also criticized the proposed pension reform. In a newspaper
interview, he said that financing pensions by increasing the eco-tax was a
monstrous idea. Overall, however, Henkel supports the government's drive to
cut spending, and is calling for further steps to reduce the country's
mountain of debt.

Tietmeyer calls for corrections in pension system
</H1>
The president of the German Central Bank, Hans Tietmeyer, has called for
corrections to the pension system. He told the newspaper "Die Welt" that the
generation of those paying into the system is shrinking all the time, while
the number of those drawing pensions is constantly growing. He said that if
changes were not made, the expenses would increase explosively. Tietmeyer
therefore called for adjustments to be made that reflect the demographic
trends.

Greens want internal programmatic renewal
</H1>
More and more Green politicians are calling for a clearer profile for their
party. At meetings in Leipzig and Berlin, they came out in favour of
programmatic renewal for the party, given the poor results achieved in
recent elections. Executive spokesman Gunda Roestel welcomed the impetus for
a new basic platform. Roestel said the Greens must re-establish a stronger
connection with German society. She also called on her party to establish a
sharper image in economic policy. At a meeting of the youth wing of the
party in Leipzig, Roestel said that the competence of the Greens in matters
such as business tax reform was not enough in the public consciousness. She
added that their partner in the federal coalition, the SPD, was working on
modernizing itself through its Schroeder-Blair Paper, and that the Greens
had to meet the same challenge. Roestel wants the Green Party to become an
active, realistic workshop of modernity.

Due care not taken with privacy in new media
</H1>
The Federal Commissioner for Information Security (privacy commissioner),
Joachim Jacob, has accused Germans of being too lax about privacy in their
use of "new media". At the opening of the International Broadcasting
Exhibition, Jacob said on Suedwestfunk radio that some people were very
conscious of security, but that most people were so captivated by the new
communications technologies such as e-mail and cellular phones that they
overlooked the dangers.

German Rail to close 250 ticket sales counters
</H1>
The German Railway is considering closing a quarter of its ticket sales
counters, or farming them out to travel agencies. The company's spokesman
for the Travel and Tourism Department, Martin Katz, said that 250 counters
in train stations were no longer economically viable. Plans are to promote
ticket sales via the internet or the telephone. Travellers would then be
able to print out the previously ordered tickets at vending machines in
railway stations.

Protests against egg-laying batteries
</H1>
Around 2000 animal-rights activists have met in Eschlkam, in the Oberpfalz
(Upper Palatinate) region, to protest against the construction of an
egg-laying battery plant on the other side of the Czech border. The protest
was instigated by cooperating animal rights groups in both countries. In an
opening speech at the protest, the leader of the Bavarian SPD, Renate
Schmidt, said that such large-scale cruelty to animals could harm the Czech
Republic's chances of being accepted into the European Union. The spokesman
for the German Animal Protection League, Thomas Schroeder, voiced the
suspicion that the plant was being financed by Anton Pohlmann, a businessman
from Oldenburg convicted of cruelty to animals. Czech activists demonstrated
around the clock at the construction site, where work on a rearing station
for 200,000 chicks was begun last Thursday.

AIDS help agency criticizes two-class society
</H1>
The German AIDS help agency has called the treatment of HIV-infected
refugees completely inadequate. The Secretary-General for the organization,
Stefan Etgeton, at a convention in Nuremberg, spoke of a two-class society.
He said that Germany only pays for medical treatment for the refugees when
they are so acutely ill that treatment is absolutely necessary. Therefore,
the agency is demanding a change to the laws concerning refugees, to get
them better medical treatment.
