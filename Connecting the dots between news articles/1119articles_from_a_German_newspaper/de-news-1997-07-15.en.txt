Heavy thunderstorms in Middle and Upper Franconia
</H1>
Last night, heavy thunderstorms have caused considerable damage especially
in Middle and Upper Franconia. Fire fighters had to pump water out of
basements and remove fallen treas. In the Upper Franconian District of
Kulmbach a barn was hit by lightning and caught fire. About 100 animals
died in the fire. At the same time, the eastern border region of Germany is
threatened by floodings due to the century flood in eastern Europe. The
water of the River Oder rises by 30 cm daily. The crest of the flood is

Report on the Environment: impacts on environment have decreased
</H1>
The impact of environmentally dangerous substances on air, water, and soil
in Germany has significantly diminished. Increasing traffic, however,
remains an environmental problem. These are the conclusions of the latest
Report on the Environment presented today by the Federal Office for the
Environment. Environment Minister Angela Merkel said the basically positive
development was due to legal regulations and narrow limits. At the same
time, she pointed out new, complex environmental problems whose fight was
much more difficult than that of individual chemicals. Merkel mentioned
amongst others climate change, extinction of species, and increasing
traffic.

Waigel asserts subsidies of eastern states will continue
</H1>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel has asserted that subsidies for the eastern
states will continue on a high level in the next budget year. He stated
that the net transfer to the eastern states in 1998 would be DM90 billion.
He pointed out that the promotion of investments had been spared almost all
cuts. The minister refused to table a bill already now to reduce the
solidarity tax by two percentage points in case the mediation talks about
the tax reform failed. Waigel said he did not like such a plan, pointing at
demands by coalition partner FDP. On Deutschlandfunk radio the FDP faction
leader Hermann Otto Solms said if there is no other way, the solidarity tax
would have to be reduced independent of the tax reform.

New dispute in tax politics
</H1>
The quarrel about the reduction of the solidarity tax has put the coalition
under a new grinding stress. Finance Minister Theo Waigel vehemently
rejected the FDP's demand to reduce the tax even if the tax reform failed.
Those who demand a separate tax must also be clear about the
finance-political consequences, Waigel said after a meeting of the CSU
executive board. A further increase of new debts was also out of the
question. FDP faction leader Hermann Otto Solms had demanded earlier to
reduce the solidarity tax even if the tax reform failed, that would be the
only possibility. Economy and employees required this signal.

Agreement in the east German construction industry
</H1>
Employers and union have reached an agreement in the collective bargaining
for the east German construction industry. The agreement provides that the
gradual increase of wages to those in the west will be suspended. The wages
will be kept at 94 percent of those in the west until March when new
negotiations will start. At the same time, conditions for an employment
guarantee have been agreed. They allow individual employers to reduce union
wages by up to 10 percent to avoid impending lay-offs, short time or work
by a subcontractor.

Criticism of planned revision of nuclear energy code
</H1>
Saxony-Anhalt's Environment Minister Heidrun Heidecke has announced that
she would use the full extent of the law to fight the revision of the
nuclear energy code planned by Federal Environment Minister Angela Merkel.
In view of the planned extension of the permit for the nuclear storage
facility Morsleben until 2005 the Alliance90/Greens politician said on
Deutschlandfunk radio that this was environmental protection of low
quality. The CDU/CSU Bundestag faction spokesman for energy issues
Kurt-Dieter Grill called on the SPD to pass a motion regarding the revision
of the nuclear code. The Social-Democrats could not say on the one side
that they would support nuclear power for the next 25 to 30 years and on
the other side refuse to accept a disposal plan.

No fees for tax exemption orders
</H1>
Bank customers will no longer have to pay fees for ordering their banks to
exempt their accounts from automatic taxation of interests. The Federal
High Court in Karlsruhe ruled this morning that contrary conditions by the
banks were void. They argued that investors would be disadvantaged by this
administrative fee in an incommensurate way. Until now, some banks have
charged annual fees of between DM10 and DM15.
