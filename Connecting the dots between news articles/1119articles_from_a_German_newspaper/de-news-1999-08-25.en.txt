Cabinet approves tax plan
</H1>
The cabinet has approved the tax and savings package of the
red-green coalition, which will result in a reduction in the federal
budget of more than 30 billion DM. The assembled ministers, picking up
their work in Berlin, adopted the limitations on pension increases to
match inflation for the next two years. Furthermore, reductions for
families, further steps for the ecology tax and tax reform were put in
place. Minister of Finance Eichel now plans to recruit the State
Premiers in support of the package. Eichel hopes to dispel doubts in
the SPD-lead states. The resolutions should lead to a savings of 30.4
billion DM next year. The government and coalition parties are open to
corrections to the package, but only if the total savings target is
retained.

<P>
The governments cost cutting measures produced a mixed response. The
opposition has criticized the concept. In addition, states and
municipalities have called for corrections. The German trade union
federation has criticized the austerity measures as socially
inequitable. Employers oppose the measures as not going far enough.

Government says earthquake assistance not too little
</H1>
The government continues to reject criticism of the earthquake
assistance Germany has so far provided to Turkey. Foreigners'

DM is merely emergency help. When it comes to support for
reconstruction efforts in the Turkish earthquake zone, it will be
quite a different order of magnitude. According to Turkish
organizations, the CDU/CSU today also criticized the money promised by
the government as too little.

High court says doctors in shared practice share responsibility
</H1>
Physicians of the same speciality who share a practice are
necessarily liable for the errors of their colleagues. This was
decided by the Federal High Court in a judgement handed down today. In
the case before the court, a gynecologist had failed to detect the
pregnancy of a 46 year old female patient. The woman later gave birth
to a disabled infant. According to the high court judgement, the
doctor cannot appeal to the fact that a colleague had also overlooked
the pregnancy. Both physicians must now pay compensation for the
support of the disabled child and its additional needs.
