BDI warns against tax increases to fill in budgetary holes
</H1>
The Federal Alliance of German Industry (BID) has warned against
tax increases to fill in budgetary holes.  Only iron discipline
would help in this matter, BDI President Henkel told the news
agency ddp.  Mr. Henkel considers the sale of the Telekom stock
which Federal Minister for Finances Weigel was considering, and the
reevaluation of the gold reserves in the federal bank to be emergency
surgical procedures which would not really cure the patient in the
long run.  But, he stated, this would still be better than raising
the new debt ceiling. The BDI president continued to plead for
massive savings in the budget of Federal Labor Minister Bluem.

Discussion of deficits in the federal budget
</H1>
 The rising deficits in the federal budget continue to
stimulate discussion.  During a newspaper interview the president
of the Federal Institute for Economic Research located in Halle,
Pohl, advocated raising the debt ceiling in order to balance the budget
after loss of tax income.  Overdrawn cuts in expenditures would damage
the health of the economy.  The labor wing of the Union rejects the
raising of taxes to compensate for lower revenues.  The CDA-head,
Mr. Eppelmann said Christian Democrat workers would only agree to
raising taxes to finance payments not covered by insurance; such
payments would lessen the burden on the social coffers.  The
president of the Retailers' Alliance, Mr. Franzen, also warned
against raising taxes.  He said that would be a catastrophe for
retailers.

Debate within the ruling coalition over coming tax hikes
</H1>
The debate over possible tax increases to cover budget shortfalls is getting more heated within the ruling coalition. FDP leader
Gerhardt declared in an interview that his party could only agree to
one more budget without tax hikes. Federal Finance Minister Waigel said
at the same time that he could not completely rule out tax increases for
the coming year. Waigel announced that he would submit a budget for
1998 that conformed to the constitution at the meeting of Sudeten
Germans. The first source for income replacement must be further privatization and the removal of state tax subsidies. On the subject of tax
hikes Waigel said specifically that they were the absolute last resort,
and an undesireable one at that, as a source for more income.

DGB argues for reduction in pension levels
</H1>
In contrast to the Social Democrats, the German Workers' Council (DGB) is
campaigning for a reduction in pension levels. Council leader Schulte told
the Cologne paper "Sonntags Express" that this was a necessity for demographic reasons. Because of increased life expectancies, people require
pensions for longer periods. At the same time there are fewer working
contributors. Schulte also made clear that coalition plans for higher
tax levels for old age care was a reasonable topic. It is not a taboo
theme, as long as the normal pensioner is exempt. The DGB leader added
that the negotiations between Federal Labor Minister Bluem, employers
and unions must conclude with a pension agreement in the next four to
six weeks.
