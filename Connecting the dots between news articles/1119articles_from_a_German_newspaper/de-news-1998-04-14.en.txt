Rexrodt: Discussion of Eco-Taxes is "phantom debate"
</H1>
Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt has called the discussion
on a possible introduction of eco-taxes (ecological taxes) a "phantom
debate". In the BILD tabloid, the FDP politician says eco-taxes could
only be introduced EU-wide; otherwise only German businesses would be
burdened, and thus German jobs be threatened. The other EU member states,
however, do not appear to be very interested in such a new tax scheme.

Attemps to settle CDU/CSU do not spare Schaeuble from further attacks
</H1>
Despite several attemps of leading CSU politicians to settle
the dispute with CDU/CSU faction leader in the Bundestag (lower house
of parliament) Wolfgang Schaeuble, the CDU politicians has been
attacked again by several CSU representatives. The Bavarian State
Secretary of Economics, Mr Spitzner, said in the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung"
newspaper, Mr Schaeuble must have been totally out of mind. He [Mr
Schaeuble] wanted to make the CSU a state party of the CDU. The Bavarian
State Secretary of the Interior, Mr Sauter, said the Union [CDU/CSU] has in
the person of Helmut Kohl a chancellor, and in Wolfgang Schaeuble a
candidate [for chancellorship] - that was one [person] to many. Earlier,
the CSU leadership had warned against a damaging leadership debate.
Leader of the CSU faction in the Bavarian parliament Alois Glueck said
he did no see any reason at all at the moment to speculate on the
succession of Mr Kohl. If, however, one would ask this question now,
Mr Schaeuble were his natural successor. Within the CSU there were no
reservations against Mr Schaeuble.

Despite economic up-turn new unemployment record?
</H1>
According to the forecast of economic experts, the German
job market will see a new record in the number of unemployed people
this year. Despite the lasting export boom, the Nuremberg Institut
fuer Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (Institute for job-market and
career research) predicts an average of 4.46 million unemployed people
for this year, up by 75.000 compared to last year. The institute that is
affiliated with the Federal Labour Office based its calculation on
a predicted economic growth of 2.75%. Other institutes as well as the
Federal government predict a higher growth rate of the economy.
In the course of the year the researchers [of the Nuremberg institute]
expect a change in trend that, however, will not be a breakthrough [with
respect to the job market]. All in all, Germany is short of some seven
million jobs, according to the Nuremberg researchers.
