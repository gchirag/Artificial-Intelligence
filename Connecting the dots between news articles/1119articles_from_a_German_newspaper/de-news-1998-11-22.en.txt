Party conference of Bavarian Green Party
</H1>
The Bavarian Green Party have a new regional executive. At the close of
their party conference in Erlangen, members elected Margarete Bause and
Jerzy Montag, both of Munich, as the new regional party leaders. 39-year old
Ms. Bause replaces Ruth Paulig, 51-year old Mr. Montag succeeds Bernd
Schreyer. Ms. Paulig and Mr. Schreyer chose not to stand again for office.
Liane Rohen from Munich was confirmed as treasurer. The two new regional
party leaders have meanwhile spoken out in favor of internal party reforms.
They have called for a relaxation of the current separation of office and
mandate. Under certain circumstances, it would then be possible for mandate
holders from the Greens to also occupy positions in the regional executive.
Margarete Bause, who served as regional chairman  from 1991 to 1993,
announced a closing of ranks between the regional party association and the
parliamentary party group in the Bundestag. Mr. Montag wants above all to
strengthen the role of the Bavarian Greens as an opposition party.

Clement responds to criticism
</H1>
The state premier of North Rhine Westphalia, Mr. Clement, has responded to
the serious criticisms of his statements on tax policy. Government
spokesman, Mr. Buchow, declared that the letter from Mr. Clement to
Chancellor Schroeder and Finance Minister Lafontaine which was published by
the news magazine "Focus," dates from more than two weeks ago. He added that
the letter had little relevance to the current situation. In the letter to
the federal government, Mr. Clement had demanded a radical change of course
with a significant lowering of tax rates. Mr. Clement's demand that some
areas of industry be totally exempt from environmental tax provoked strong
protests from the Greens. In the letter, Mr. Clement also called for top
income tax rate to be lowered to below 40% and the lowest tax band to 15%.
According to "Focus," he wrote that the current tax policy would not aid the
creation of new jobs; it might well have negative effects instead. A further
source of criticism is the new regulations concerning the so-called "620 DM
jobs." In the individual German states in particular, party-wide dissent is
emerging against the abandonment of a flat rate of tax and the resulting
fall in income tax revenue.

Fire on Pallas extinguished
</H1>
According to the Dutch head of operations, Mr. Nauta, the fire on the
stricken freighter Pallas has been extinguished. He said it would take
another three weeks to pump off the rest of the oil. Approximately 580 tons
of oil are still in the freighter's tanks. At the moment a twenty-man strong
salvage team is working on the wreck.

<P>
The Ministry for the Environment in Kiel, however, declined to confirm that
the fire had been completely extinguished, saying this would only be known
for sure when the ship had cooled down. The drilling rig Barbara has so far
pumped 17 tons of oil out of the wreck. Since the accident almost four weeks
ago, fifty tons of fuel have escaped into the water.

The lists are to be submitted to the electoral officer for the state of
Bremen before the end of the year. The senate must then decide whether or
not the petition can proceed. If the committee agrees with the proposal, the
organizers will have to collect 100,000 signatures.
