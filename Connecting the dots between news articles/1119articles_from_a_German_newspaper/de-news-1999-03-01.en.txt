Lafontaine puts statements on PDS into perspective
</H1>
SPD party leader Lafontaine put the recent statements on collaboration
with the PDS ino perspective.  Following a meeting of the SPD party
council today, he said that these statements did not contain any new
information.  He said, "We will continue to deal with this issue for
the next 10 years if necessary, if no other important issues arise."
The position of the SPD remains the same: The east-German state
associations can decide for themselves whether they would like to work
together with the PDS. Since such a position already existed, the
Dresden Statement by the SPD from 1994 was obsolete. This statement
had ruled out any cooperation with the PDS.

Talks on agricultural reform postponed
</H1>
The Ministry of Agriculture in Bonn announced that the second round of
talks on the agricultural reform of the European Union in Brussels was
postponed until Thursday. The Ministry's postponement was in response
to a request from the French government. The Paris government stated
that it wanted to gain time to search for a compromise in the
discussion on agricultural reform. Last Friday, the first round of
talks on financing the EU agriculture budget were postponed primarily
after differences between France and Germany on financing aspects.
Federal chancellor Schroeder once again called on the European
political leaders to quickly remove all obstacles to EU reforms.
During the conference of the social-democratic party of Europe in
Milan, Schroeder demanded that the so-called agenda 2000 be passed
this year.

Number of drug-related deaths and first-time users increased
</H1>
The number of drug-related deaths in Germany last year was 11.5% higher
than in 1997. The number had climbed to 1600. In light of the current
numbers, Christa Nickels, the drug commissioner of the federal government, referred to them as "a disturbing trend." The increase in socalled first-time users of hard drugs is also unfortunate. Their number
increased in 1998 to almost 21,000, exactly 1.7% higher than the previous year. While drug use among adults did not increase, the number of
teens using drugs increased. According to Christa Nickels, tobacco remained the number one drug, followed closely by alcohol.
