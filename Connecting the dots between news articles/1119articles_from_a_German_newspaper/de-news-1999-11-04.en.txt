Bundestag votes on health care reform 2000
</H1>
The German Bundestag voted on the government's health care reform
plan today. The CDU announced that it plans to block the bill in the upper
house or Bundesrat. The most controversial items in the bill are the global
budget and the planned closing of many hospitals. Before the decisive debate
in the Bundestag, Health Minister Andrea Fischer invited the CDU/CSU as well
as the states to compromise talks on health care reform. CDU/CSU
parliamentary party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble responded that the Union would
only be willing to talk after the bill had been withdrawn. During the debate,
the usual arguments were heard. The SPD's social policy expert Rudolf
Dressler said that health care expenditures had to be limited or the premiums
for health insurance would rise. Quack remedies therefore had to be removed
from the health care system, he added. The CDU/CSU's health care spokesperson
Wolfgang Lohmann maintained that the planned introduction of a global budget
would lead to patients not receiving necessary treatments. He continued that
the bill would not make it through the Bundesrat. After heated discussions,
the Bundestag passed Health Care Reform 2000 and rejected a motion by the
CDU/CSU and the FDP to postpone the vote until Friday.
