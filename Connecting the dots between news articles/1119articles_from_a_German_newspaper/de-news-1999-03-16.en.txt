Schroeder announces quick appointment of new EU Commission
</H1>
After the resignation of the EU Commission, German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder announced a quick decision on its future members. Mr. Schroeder
who is currently holding the office of President of the EU Council will
contact the governments of the other EU states within the next days. Mr.
Schroeder rejected the notion of a crisis of the Union. Rather, the
resignation should be taken as an opportunity to advance the reforms within
the EU. After a meeting in Brussels with acting Commission President
Jacques Santer, Mr. Schroeder said the Berlin EU summit next week must be
successful rather now than at any other time to prove its capability of
acting.
Last night, the 20-member EU Commission had resigned jointly, after an
independent group of experts had accused them of mismanagement and
sloppiness.

No more reforms of citizenship code for now
</H1>
After SPD, Buendnis90/Gruene and FDP have agreed on the reform of the
citizenship code, the government does not have any plans to further amend
the law in this field. After a cabinet meeting, Interior Minister Otto
Schily said the topic was closed for this legislature period. At the end of
May the reform bill will be passed in the Bundestag. The bill provides
amongst others that children born in Germany by foreigners will also
receive the German citizenship [in addition to their foreign citizenship].
By the age of 23 they must choose one citizenship. Foreigners who
permanently live in Germany will have a right to German citizenship after
eight years. Double citizenship for adults as it was planned originally has
been removed from the reform and will be allowed only to prevent hardships.
Today, the FDP faction unanimously endorsed the bill. Yesterday, SPD and
Buendnis90/Gruene had already endorsed the bill with a large majority. FDP
secretary-general Guido Westerwelle appealed again to the CDU and CSU
members of parliament to support the bill.

</H1>
In a policy document, financial experts of Buendnis90/Gruene have demanded

"Initiative for investment, Labour and Environment" the authors demand a
lasting improvement of the basic conditions for investments in Germany.
Amongst others, they call for a general tax reduction for enterprises to 35
percent. The maximum income tax should be reduced from 53 to 47 or 45
percent. The Green financial experts are also in favour of a higher
taxation of fuels and a reduction of federal subsidies by ten percent
annually.

Berlin Senate suspends competition for Holocaust Memorial
</H1>
The quarrel about the planed Holocaust Memorial is going into a new round.
The Berlin Senate now decided in a vote to suspend the competition for the
Holocaust Memorial for the time being. A senate spokesperson said the
senate was now waiting for a decision by the Bundestag. For the first time
the CDU members and Berlin's State Premier Eberhard Diepgen, a CDU member,
were able to outvote the SPD members. The Berlin Senate together with the
federal government and a private support association had invited
contributions for a memorial competition. The majority of members of
federal parliament apparently favour the draft by US architect Eisenman who
wants to erect a large field of slabs to commemorate the more than 6
million murdered Jews during the Nazi period.

</H1>
The last free kidnapper of millionaire Jan-Phillip Remtsma has apparently
turned himself in. However, this information obtained by the broadcasting
corporation Norddeutscher Rundfunk has not been officially confirmed yet.
Reporter of the magazine "Stern" are said to have tracked down the
32-year-old Polish man in Barcelona, Spain. The man stated that he was the
only one present when the alleged mastermind of the kidnappers, Thomas
Drach, abducted the Hamburg millionaire in March 1996. Mr. Reemtsma had
been released after 33 days only after a ransom of 30 million DM had been
paid.

Pay rise for civil servants
</H1>
Civil servants will benefit the same wage increases as laid down in
the bargaining agreement for employees in the public sector, though with
a delai of two months, said Federal Interior Minister Otto Schily. According
to Deutsche Presseagentur (DPA) news agency, Mr Schily intends to discuss
the corresponding changes to the law on civil service wages with the unions.

of civil servants in the Neue Laender (former East-Germany) will be fixed until
the end of 2002 at 86.5% of those in the West, was repudiated by the Minister.

Lower Telekom tarifs rejected
</H1>
The Federal Commission for Post and Telecommunication has rejected for
the first time a price cut by one of the competitors. According to its
decision, market leader Deutsche Telekom is not allowed to cut its night
tarif for local calls to 3 Pfennigs (DM 0.03) per minute. The President of
the Commission, Mr Scheuerle, said this price was not cost-covering [i.e.
dumping]. The Commission, however, approved Telekom's new night tarif of
6 Pfennigs per minute for long distance calls which will come into effect
April 1.

Educational leave courses have to relate to Germany
</H1>
The Federal Labour Court has fixed narrow limits for educational
leave when spent in a foreign country. According to a decision published
today, the courses taken during educational leave have to provide knowledge
or insight that are related to or hold equally in Germany. The aim of the
further political education was to improve the employees' understanding
of social and political relations to enable them to participate in the
democratic process in their own country. Thus the court rejected a case
brought by a man who wanted a course taken in Havana about the political
and social situation in Cuba to be acknowledged for educational leave.

Corinna Mey not allowed to participate at Grand Prix d'Eurovision
</H1>
The winner of the German qualifying contest for the pop contest
"Grand Prix d'Eurovision", singer Corinna Mey, will not be allowed to take
part in the finale in Israel. According to Norddeutscher Rundfunk radio
station, the reason was that songs that had been published before the current
year were not allowed to take part in the contest. The song entered into the
contest by Corinna Mey "Hoer den Kindern einfach zu" ("Just listen to the
children") was sung two years ago with a different text by a different
artist. It is now expected that the second placed German-Turkish group
"Surpris" will represent Germany in the contest with their song "Reise
nach Jerusalem" ("Journey to Jerusalem").
