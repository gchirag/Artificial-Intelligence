CDU scandal
</H1>
According to a report in "Welt am Sonntag," large sums of money for the
CDU came from the Hessen chapter of the party. The newspaper states that
this was the finding of the first interim report by the financial auditors
on the flow of payments and transactions to and from the Hessen CDU both
in Germany and abroad.  The CDU expects to gain additional information
from Horst Weyrauch's final report, which was submitted today.  It is
several pages long. According to a party spokesperson, nothing could be
said about the contents of the report at this time. The evaluation will
take a week.

<P>
Weyrauch is considered a key figure in the financial scandal. He worked
for 28 years as an auditor for the state division of the CDU and was
simultaneously employed with the CDU at the federal level. He is accused
of smuggling 18 million marks to Switzerland in 1983.  According to the
magazine "Focus," Weyrauch warned the CDU that a political storm would
break out if he was forced to give a detailed account. The CDU executive
committee is considering taking legal action against the former financial
auditor. It wishes to ascertain whether the federal CDU has illegal bank
accounts in Switzerland.  According to "Focus," Weyrauch threatened the
party, saying, If you learn the truth, the Federal Republic will be on
shaky ground.

Der Spiegel has reported that the millions of CDU marks have left a paper
trail that also leads to Paraguay.  It is alleged that Weyrauch and the
former treasurer, the Prince of Sayn-Wittgenstein, used their Paraguay
connections to create false bequests. A doctor was supposedly open to
bribes in exchange for issuing fake death certificates.

CDU financial audits
</H1>
The auditing company Ernst & Young, which examined the CDU accounts,
apparently has closer ties to the CDU than previously believed. According
to information in "Der Spiegel" magazine, the financial auditing firm,
praised by CDU head Schaeuble for its independance, has worked for the
party for years. Ernst & Young was reportedly responsible for the
financial auditing of the French mineral oil company Elf-Aquitaine and the
Leuna refinery. Elf allegedly paid 85 million marks in bribery money when
it acquired the refinery.

Rau sees a loss of credibility in politicians
</H1>
Federal President Johannes Rau believes that the latest CDU scandal has
caused a big credibility problem with politicians. Mr. Rau told the "Bild
Zeitung" that he could offer former chancellor Kohl's no advice concerning
his refusal to reveal the names of the anonymous donors.  The only people
that could coax him into talking were people that have not made any public
statements on the matter.
