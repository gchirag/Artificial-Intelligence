Mourning Mother Teresa's death
</H1>
The whole world has lauded Mother Teresa as an outstanding
personality and as a role model.  The 87 year old nun died of heart
failure Friday evening in Calcutta.  In 1950 Mother Teresa had
founded the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, which, among
other activities, ran schools, orphanages and the famous house
for the dying.  In 1970 she received the Nobel Peace Prize for her
work on behalf of the poor and the sick.

<P>
At his summer residence, Gandolfo Castle, upon learning of the
death of the nun, Pope John Paul II called her a woman who
distinguished our century.  A Vatican spokesperson explained that
the Pope had received the news about the death of the winner of the
Nobel Peace Prize with deep pain and great emotion.  For the head
of the Catholic Church, Mother Teresa had constituted shiny proof
for the transformation of love for God into love for one's neighbor
and into love for those abandoned by society.  US-President Clinton
characterized her as an incredible personality who gave comfort to
the suffering, the poor and the dying and served as an inspiration
and a challenge for humankind.  President of the German Parliament
Suessmuth spoke of Mother Teresa as a woman of living Christian
faith in an unpeaceful world.  The nun, she continued, gave people
of the most varied origins  an example of a life of taking
responsibility for one's fellow human beings.

<P>
Next Wednesday, the angel of the poor, a name not only given to
Mother Teresa in India, is to be buried on the grounds of her Order
in Calcutta.

Mr. Hoerster appeals to SPD to stop blocking tax reform
</H1>
Parliamentary Business Manager of the CDU/CSU factions Hoerster has
appealed to the Social Democrats to stop blocking the planned tax
reform.  Mr. Hoerster told DEUTSCHLANDRADIO BERLIN on Saturday
morning that he was somewhat doubtful whether the SPD really wanted
to bring about a net reduction of the tax burden of the people.
The reason for his doubts is that the Social Democrats have not
succeeded to date in offering alternative proposals.  The upper
house of Parliament, which represents a majority of SPD-governed
states, rejected the tax proposals of the Coalition on Friday.  The
federal government and the states still want to try again to find
a compromise, probably as early as next week.

Apparent movement in relations between EU and Iran
</H1>
 Apparently, there is the beginning of some movement in
the frozen diplomatic relations between Iran and the European
Union.  Irna, the official news agency, reported that an ambassador
of the EU had met in Teheran with a representative of the Foreign
Ministry.  No details of the meeting were given.  Almost all EU-
countries recalled their ambassadors from Teheran in April because
the Iranian government had requested that the German ambassador
leave.  The reason for this action was the so-called  Mykonosverdict by which the Berlin Supreme Court had charged the Iranian
leadership with terrorism.

Rhine-Ruhr area will not apply to host Olympics
</H1>
 The decision of the IOC to give the 2004 summer games to
Athens was greeted with enthusiasm in the capital of Greece.  Many
Athenians are celebrating their selection with motorcades, horn
honking concerts and firecrackers.  In Rome and Stockholm, the most
promising competitors, tens of thousands of people were
disappointed by the decision.  Immediately after the announcement,
the initiative circle of the Rhine-Ruhr area announced that it
would now give up the idea of applying to host the 2008 games.  The
reason: Because a European host has been selected for 2004, their
application for the year 2008 would no longer stand a chance.
