NATO air attacks on Yugoslavia
</H1>
NATO has again bombed targets in Yugoslavia, apparently resulting in
civilian victims. According to the Serbian police, a woman was killed in a
bombing raid on the town of Sitz. A further 30 people were also apparently
injured. Air raid alarms were sounded in Belgrade in the afternoon
(Sunday). The Russian Minister of Defence has said that he regrets the  the
intensification of the NATO air attacks on Yugoslavia. He said that this
did not provide a satisfactory basis for peace negotiations. Two NATO
aeroplanes have crashed over Serbia and the Adriatic. The pilots were able
to eject from the planes. According to Serbian sources, an American F16 jet
was shot down west of Belgrade yesterday. NATO, however, says that the
plane had just had engine problems. As regards the crash in the Adriatic,
the NATO Alliance said that the jet had crashed into the sea while
attempting to land on an aircraft carrier. Previous to this, NATO admitted
that they had inadvertently hit a bus while bombing a bridge in Kosovo,
killing 47 people and injuring 16. It had been reported earlier that there
were 60 dead. The NATO statement said that the bus had been crossing the
bridge at the time that the missile had been fired.

Political solution to the Kosovo conflict
</H1>
The German government says that they see progress in the efforts for a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis. Mr. Wickert, Under Secretary in
the Ministry for Defence, said that it could be seen from several
statements originating from Serbian leadership that they would be agreeable
to a military presence in Kosovo. Belgrade's conditions, however, are still
too far apart from NATO's demands. A group of US congressmen who are
presently in Vienna have discussed a basic agreement with Russian members
of parliament. Congressman Weldon said after a two-day round of talks that
the two groups had basically agreed to a draft peace plan. This has been
communicated to President Milosevic via a Yugoslavian participant. However,
according to the US embassy in Vienna, the congressmen had not been acting
on behalf of the American government. Official reactions from NATO
countries to the peace plan are not yet known.

Interdenominational Christian "week for life"
</H1>
An ecumenical "Week for Life" began with appeals for more care for the
environment. In the opening event in Dusseldorf, Mr. Koch, President of the
Protestant Church in German, said that the creation should not be
considered as a manipulatable mass but rather as something lent to us by
God. Bishop Lehmann, the Chairman of the Catholic Bishops Conference, said
that all economic and ecological decisions should take into the account the
needs of future generations. The "Week for Life" motto is that God's Earth
was made for living.

Future of the German atomic industry
</H1>
The Green party have criticised Chancellor Schroeder's statements regarding
the future of the German atomic industry. According to this statement,
Germany will only depart from atomic energy in 25 to 30 years. Ms. Radcke,
spokesperson for the Green's party executive, said that it is totally
absurd to talk about this sort of time frame. This could be considered a
promotion of atomic energy rather than departing from it.
