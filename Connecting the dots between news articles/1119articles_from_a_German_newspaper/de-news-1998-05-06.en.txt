71st Franco-German summit in Avignon
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac of France met this evening in
Avignon, in southern France, for the 71st Franco-German summit. Kohl
arrived a little late at the summit because of the debate in the
Bundestag on the introduction of the Euro, where he had insisted that
the disagreement over who should be made head of the proposed European
Central Bank would not damage Franco-German relations. Representatives
from the SPD and the Greens accused the government of being partially
responsible for the disagreement over the position, saying that the
government had not been properly prepared for the EU summit. Kohl is
to meet Prime Minister Jospin in Avignon tomorrow and the
Franco-German Defence and Security Council is also due to meet.

Increase in neo-nazi violence in German
</H1>
A report from the German Domestic Intelligence Agency, presented by
Manfred Kanther, the Federal Minister for the Interior, states that
Neo-nazi crimes have increased in Germany by a third in comparison
with 1996. The report states that 12,000 neo-nazi crimes were
registered, including 800 attacks on foreigners. 3,000 crimes were
registered as committed by extreme left-wingers; in this connection,
Kanther claimed that the dissolution of the Red Army Fraction (RAF)
was due to the state following a consistent security policy.

Politicians say no to ban for DVU
</H1>
Members of the Federal Government, the Opposition and the German
Domestic Intelligence Agency have all spoken against banning the DVU
(='German People's Union' an extreme right-wing political party); this
was in response to a call for a ban made by Lower Saxony's Minister
for the Interior Glogowski. Manfred Kanther, the Federal Minister for
the Interior, said that although the DVU was working against Germany's
constitution, the problem would not be solved by a ban. Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the leader of the Bundestag parliamentary party of the CDU,
made the same point, and in an interview with the 'Deutschlandfunk'
radio station, Daeubler-Gmelin, an SPD law spokesperson, called for
the fight against the DVU to be carried out using political methods.
The president of Saxony's Domestic Intelligence Agency, Dietrich, said
that a ban would only drive the supporters of extreme right-wing
parties underground. The Interior Ministers of the federal states are
to discuss Glogowski's suggestion on Friday.

CDU publishes revised version of 'programme for the future'
</H1>
The CDU has published a revised version of its 'programme for the
future'. Despite criticism from the CSU, the CDU's position on
ecological policy remains unchanged; on the question of the much
debated energy tax, the document says that such a step would only be
possible on a Europe-wide basis. There are some revisions regarding
interior security, including a positive view on the setting-up of a
genetic data base by the federal criminal police. A new proposal is
that foreign nationals who are convicted in Germany should be expelled
from Germany to their country of origin after they have been
sentenced.

The leaders of both the SPD and the CDU in Magdeburg have announced
that coalition talks between the two parties are due to start in
Saxony-Anhalt on Friday. Neither party mentioned definitive coalition

Saxony-Anhalt, said that there were still other possibilities open to
the SPD, as the winners of the election, for the formation of a
government. Daehrer, the leader of the CDU in Saxony-Anhalt, said that
the talks were aimed at the construction of a government by the two
parties.

thinks it should not become normal for German citizens to visit
doctors outside Germany. In an interview with Koblenz's
'Rhein-Zeitung' newspaper, he said that, despite the decisions made on
this issue by the European Court, he wants to see that the EU member
states' welfare systems are harmonised immediately; Germany's standard
of social provision should be maintained.

Kirch-Bertelsmann alliance looks less likely
</H1>
It is looking less likely that the proposed Pay-TV alliance between
the two media companies Kirch and Bertelsmann will be allowed to go
ahead, according a report in the 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' newspaper. The
report, in today's issue, asserts that the EU member states have
spoken out against the merger. Kirch and Bertelsmann run the
'Premiere' subscription TV channel together, and, the newspaper
reports, the EU Competition Office believes that the planned merger
between this channel and the Kirch-run 'DF1' would produce a monopoly.
