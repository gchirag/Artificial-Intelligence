SPD demands capital levy for millionaires
</H1>

Bonn. Rudolf Scharping, the SPD parliamentary party leader, has ratified
the SPD's demand that multi-millionaires should pay a capital levy. In a
newspaper interview Mr. Scharping said such a capital levy could earn up to
30 billion marks in additional tax revenue every year. This would mean that
those with assets worth  more than 10 million Marks will pay two percent
more and those with assets worth more than 25 million marks will pay three
percent more. The SPD politician sharply criticised tax evasion. Mr.
Scharping said that those people who amass fortunes in Germany, "reside" in
countries with lower tax rates and then expect good schools in Germany for
their children, act without social conscience and patriotism.

Stumpfe demands modest wage increases
</H1>

Werner Stumpfe, the President of the Employers' Association for the Steel
and Engineering Industry, does not want to ask for wage increases and
further reductions in working hours. Mr. Stumpfe position is contrary to
that of the Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics. Union President,
Klaus Zwickel, said only yesterday that the issues for the next round of
collective bargaining would include introducing a 32 hour week. Mr.
Stumpfe, on the other hand, has called for a decrease in taxes and
surcharges and longer working hours. He claims that this is a way to keep
wage increases below the inflation rate and still ensure that employees
earn more . The moderate collective agreement of 1.5 percent last year
prevented jobs being cut in the German metal and electronics industry. Mr.
Stumpfe is optimistic that there will be no job cuts in his area until the
end of the year.
