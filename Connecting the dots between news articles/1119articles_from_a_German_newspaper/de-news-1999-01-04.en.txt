Euro registers gains, only US reacts restrained
</H1>
The European exchange markets welcomed the Euro with high gains. Traders
registered a plus of 4% at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the first
trading day of the Euro. Other stock exchanges in Europe showed a
similar picture.  While the US government welcomed the strength of the
Euro, its reaction was reserved. If the economy were to grow in
Europe, American companies would also benefit from it. It would not
accept doubts that the Euro could replace the dollar as the number one
reserve currency. Even the US Secretary of Finance hinted that the
Euro is a currency just like any other currency. The United States
would have to remember its own strengths for which it would need a
solid economic policy.  At its onset, the Euro registered gains in
international currency trading.  The new Euro currency registered with
$1.1850 on the stock exchange in Tokyo, which is 1.5% above the value
set at the fixing in Brussels on New Year's Evening. In Singapore,
Asia's second largest currency trading place, the new European
currency also climbed to 1.18%.

Criticism of petition against dual citizenship
</H1>
The CDU suffered sharp criticism due to its proposed petition against
dual citizenship. According to the coalition and the FDP, this
increases the danger of an anti-foreigner sentiment. FDP leader
Gerhardt accused his CDU counterpart Schaeuble of no longer being
up-to-date. Wolfgang Schaeuble ignored this criticism today. Schaeuble
said he considered it to be a mistake which could not be made up if
the dual citizenship were to be realized based on Red-Green plans
without corrections. In contrast to the government, the CDU demanded
tests, such as language tests or tests for constitutional loyalty,
which applicants for German citizenship would have to pass first.

Schorlemmer favors amnesty of GDR injustice
</H1>
Former civil rights leader, Schorlemmer, endorsed an amnesty of GDR
injustice. In an interview with the newspaper "Berliner Tagesspiegel",
the winner of the peace prize from the German booksellers said, that
severe human rights violations should be excluded from this amnesty.
Schorlemmer stated that the judiciary had examined the
responsibilities for 10 years and had sentenced only a fraction of the
accused to rela- tively minor prison sentences. An amnesty is not be
regarded as a final end, but as a judicial sacrifice which would
promote internal peace and allow for a freer debate.

Hoepner demands closing law for GDR injustice
</H1>
The State Premier of Sachsen-Anhalt, Hoepner, demanded a closing law
for GDR injustice. The SPD politican wrote in an article for "Berliner
Zei- tung" that such a law will be passed during the current
legislative period. He is interested in integration, not in a final
end. An integra- tion in Germany could not succeed if complete groups
of former citizens of the GDR were to be put at a disadvantage over a
longer period of time or permanently or if they were stigmatized.
Hoepner distanced himself emphatically from demands for an amnesty or
rehabilitation.
