European employment initiatives goal of German EU presidency
</H1>
The German federal government intends to strive for higher employment
rates in Europe while it occupies the presidency of the EU Council
during the first half of 1999. The federal cabinet today approved a
list of goals and priorities. Government spokesman, Heye, said today
in Bonn that the people expect the fight against unemployment to be
made a European question. Therefore, he added, the German government
would make full use of the opportunity to deal with social and
employment policies on a European level. Heye also said that there
will be an emphasis on the internal strengthening of the EU and on the
EU's profile in foreign affairs.

German Rail's 10-point plan for better punctuality and service
</H1>
An immeditate-action plan by the executive board of the German Rail
Company (Deutsche Bahn AG), which was approved today by the
Supervisory Council, should mean better service and punctuality for
passengers. Chairman of the board, Ludewig, also said, however, that
there are also plans to cut between 18,000 and 25,000 jobs; the exact
number will depend on the success of the new plans in the next year.
The second stage of the reforms will see 75 billion DM more invested
between now and 2003. The railway unions criticised the reforms,
especially the planned redundancies. The Federation for Nature and the
Environment (=BUND) said that the changes would not do anything to
remedy the real problems, which are lack of personnel and insufficient
technical equipment.

Health Minister: public health insurance premiums to remain stable
</H1>
According to Federal Health Minister Fischer (Greens), premiums for
the public health insurance plans will remain stable for now. She told
the German Press Agency (dpa) during an interview that despite changes
to budgeting regulations, there would be no question of increasing
rates to customers. Following the announcemnt of health reform plans,
the public health insurers had said that corrections to premium rates
might be necessary. They said that the government bill would increase
costs to the insurers by an estimated 2 billion DM, an amount not
covered by other means. The Opposition today also charged that the
financing of the measures, intended to relieve patients' pocketbooks,
was by no means secure.

Clement and Schroeder closer to common position in tax dispute
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Schroeder and North Rhine-Westphalia Premier
Clement have moved closer to a common position in the tax-reform
dispute. Government spokesman Heye said that Clement had succeeded in
interesting Schroeder in his idea to double the tax-free allowance for
business taxes by withholding from a cut in general tax rates. Heye
said the Finance Ministry was examining the suggestion; their initial
assessment concluded that the move would ease the tax burden,
especially for the middle class, by about DM 1.5 billion. A spokesman
for Finance Minister Lafontaine announced that the government would do
everything possible to bring forward the planned tax cuts by two
years.

Independent office to be established to fight EU fund fraud
</H1>
The fraudulent use of EU funds will be fought more vigourously in the
future. President of the EU Commission, Santer, has suggested the
establishment of an independent office to conduct immediate
investigations in any cases of doubt about the propriety of the use of
EU moneies. However, the Commission itself would also be involved in
any external investigations, in the interests of better coordination.
Representatives in the EU criticized this last idea today, saying that
the office's independence would not be guarenteed by this. Santer
disasgreed, saying that the responsibilities of those who are to be
kept in check and of those who are to do the checking would be kept
completely separate.
