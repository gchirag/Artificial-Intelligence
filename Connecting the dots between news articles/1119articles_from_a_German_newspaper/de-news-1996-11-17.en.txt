German relief organization disappointed over UN summit in Rome
</H1>
German relief organization Welthungerhilfe (World Hunger Aid) has expressed
its disappointment over the result of the UN World Food Summit in Rome. Mr.
Hausmann, secretary-general of Welthungerhilfe said in Bonn hunger and
under-nourishment of 840 million people could not be fought with
noncommittal declarations of intent. Thus, the chance had been missed to
solve the hunger problem, which is primarily caused by politics. Hausmann
criticized especially that every government was free to decide whether to
accept the action plan passed in Rome. The conference, which is wrapping up
today, has passed a plan aiming at reducing the number of starving people
by half within twenty years.
