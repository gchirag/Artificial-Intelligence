Suessmuth denies charges
</H1>
President of the Parliament Suessmuth again rejected accusations that she
has used airplanes of the Bundeswehr for private travel. The accounts of
the weekly papers "Bild am Sonntag" and "Welt am Sonntag" are wrong and
incomplete, Mrs. Suessmuth declared in Bonn. The paper "Bild am Sonntag"
reported among other things that the CDU politician flew to Zurich to
participate in her daughter's graduation ceremony. Mrs. Suessmuth maintains
that she paid for the flight. In the meantime, a member of the Bundestag
for the first time suggested that the President resign. The SPD Member of
Parliament Klemmer told the paper "Hamburger Morgenpost" that Suessmuth has
to resign if the accusations are true. One of the reasons the SPD
politician gave for her suggestion is that normal representatives who are
not as famous as Suessmuth will face bitter complaints by their
constituents.
