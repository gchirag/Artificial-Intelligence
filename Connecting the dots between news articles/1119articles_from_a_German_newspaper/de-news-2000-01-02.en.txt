CDU will cooperate on tax and pension policies
</H1>
CDU leader Wolfgang Schaeuble has declared himself willing to work together
with the federal government on matters of tax and pension policies. The
Monday edition of the newspaper "Die Welt" quotes an excerpt to that effect
from a letter Schaeuble sent to members of his caucus. It says that given
the demographic trend, there is no way around a fundamental reform of
old-age security. Schaeuble also writes that the motto for tax policies must
be: simpler, lower, fairer; and that the CDU/CSU would only agree to tax
reforms that lowered taxes, closed loopholes, and made the entire system
easier to understand.

CDU donation affair: Schaeuble on hot seat for donation from caucus
</H1>
CDU party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble is now coming under scrutiny in the CDU
donations affair, because of a million D-Mark transfer of funds. The matter
concerns a transfer of 1.1 million D-Marks from the CDU caucus to the party
administration three years ago.
The justice spokesman for the Green Party, Volker Beck, said that Schaeuble
could not hide his handling of caucus funds behind former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl. The leader of the Green caucus, Rezzo Schlauch, demanded on ARD
television that the CDU finally give a thorough explanation of its financial
dealings.
Members of the CDU/CSU rejected all accusations in this matter. The legal
advisor for the CDU/CSU caucus, Andreas Schmidt, said of the transfer that,
due to a change in the law, the account into which CDU members of the caucus
had been, for years, paying 50 DM per month of their net income had to be
dissolved. At that time, he went on, the caucus members were given free
reign over what to do with the money. The Parliamentary Secretary for the
caucus, Joachim Hoerster, has said that the idea of giving the money to the
party apparatus was his.
Schaeuble has not yet made any statement on the matter.

Alliance for Work: Continuation in jeopardy
</H1>
There has been no agreement about the next round of Alliance for Work talks,
and that is putting this month's planned meeting in the current round in
jeopardy too. The chairman of the Public Service and Transportation Union
(OeTV), Herbert Mai, told the "Berliner Zeitung" newspaper that the
obstinate position of the employers meant there could be no compromise on
the issue of retirement at 60; and so any further talks at all were
pointless.

Wage policy negotiations in chemical industry
</H1>
The Federal Employers' Association for the chemical industry has warned the
unions against demanding too much in wage negotiations if the Alliance for
Work should collapse. The Secretary-General of the Association, Hans Paul
Frey, pointed to the success of the Alliance for Work in the Netherlands,
saying that long-term wage restraint and predictable wage policies were
critical in that success. He continued that the unions should therefore
admit not only in theory, but also at the negotiating table, that wages have
an affect on the number of jobs.
The IG Metall union has already announced that it will issue hard wage
demands in the next round of negotiations if the Alliance for work
collapses.

Quick help on hurricane damage
</H1>
Federal Agriculture Minister, Karl-Heinz Funke, has approved quick help on
damage from the recent hurricane Lothar. Baden-Wuerttemberg's Agriculture
Ministry in Stuttgart made the announcement. Plans include decreasing the
tree harvest in other German states, in order to prevent a collapse in
lumber prices. Funke also promised money for additional depots for
storm-fallen timber. According to forestry authorities, the storm caused a
quarter-million D-Marks' worth of damage in the forests of
Baden-Wuerttemberg.

Greater safety for rail passengers
</H1>
The German railway (Deutsche Bahn AG) plans to do more for the safety of
passengers in its trains and stations. Rail boss Hartmut Mehdorn said in
Berlin that more officers from the Federal Border Guard (Bundesgrenzschutz)
will be put on duty. Together with the railway's own security service, they
will patrol trains and stations. Mehdorn said that the railway was willing
to pay the federal administration an appropriate amount for the increase.

Traffic severely disrupted due to weather
</H1>
In thick fog, about 100 vehicles were involved in collisions on the A7
autobahn between Fulda and Wuerzburg this morning. Two people were killed,
and about seventy were injured, twenty seriously. Near the Roehn reststop,
the autobahn is blocked in both directions by completely wrecked
automobiles, some piled on top of each other by the force of the collisions.
According to police, the work of clearing the road will continue until far
into the night. On the scene were 180 ambulance attendants, members of the
technical aid agency (Technisches Hilfwerk), and the fire departments from
the region, as well as from the neighbouring state of Hesse. Emergency
counsellors cared for the vehicle occupants, some sufferring shock. 200
uninjured victims were taken by bus to gymnasiums in Oberthulba and Bad
Brueckenau.
In other parts of Bavaria, too, north-bound autobahn traffic came to a
virtual standstill. According to police, the line-ups reached a total length
of 200 kilometres altogether.
In Baden-Wuerttemberg, returning traffic led to 100 kilometres' worth of
traffic jams. The vehicles on the A5 autobahn between Basel (Switzerland)
and Karlsruhe formed a line 60 kilometres long; on the A8 between Munich and
Stuttgart, near the Schwaebische Alb (Swabian mountains), 35 kilometres.

Y2K computer problems: None yet
</H1>
The potentially devastating computer problems that many people feared would
arise with the year 2000 have not arisen, in Germany nor elsewhere. Banks
and stock exchanges have not yet cancelled the alarm, however. Experts point
out that a large number of potential problems could still arise in the next
few days, weeks, or even months. Monday (tomorrow) especially is being
awaited in suspense, as the banks and stock markets resume business
operations after the holiday lull. According to the banks, automated tellers
and account statement printers did not experience any notable problems with
the date change.

Wide variety of (non-food) product samples contain poison
</H1>
Many articles of clothing, carpeting, and wood varnishes apparently contain
a poisonous chemical called tributylzine (TBT). According to a report by the
economics magazine "PlusMinus", laboratory tests found the poison in 70
percent of the product samples tested. The chemical, which is used primarily
to prevent the growth of algae, is scheduled to be banned world-wide in 2003
due to danger it poses to the environment. Scientists fear that TBT may
cause sterility in people.
