Fischer criticizes Russian advance into Chechnya
</H1>
Foreign Minister Fischer criticized the advance of Russian troops
into Chechnya, and appealed to Moscow to comply with the OSCE
(Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe) code of
conduct. The conflict can only be solved through political dialog,
Fischer stressed before representatives of the OSCE in Vienna.
Violence will only lead to further radicalization of the parties
involved, he said. Meanwhile, Russian troops have taken positions
in the north of the Caucasus republic. After six days of fighting,
the provisional government in the Chechnyan capital of Grozny said
no more of its troops were in the region. Russian Finance Minister
Kasyanov announced that due to the continuing conflict in Chechnya,
defense expenditures would increase by approximately 20% in the
coming year.

Federal Social Court says public insurance needn't pay for fillings
</H1>
Public health insurance companies are not required to pay for the
replacement of amalgam dental fillings, according to a general
ruling by the Federal Social Court. That mercury leached from such
fillings can impair health has not been established conclusively by
science, but is merely an unverified assumption. Since controversy
continues among researchers regarding this matter, and no hard
evidence has been presented, it is not the place of the court to
take up the position of either side.

100 military medics assigned to East Timor
</H1>
The federal cabinet has decided to send up to 100 medical personnel
from the German Armed Forces to support the UN mission in East
Timor, which is under the control of an international peace-keeping
force. The soldiers are stationed in Darwin, Australia, and will
fly heavily wounded persons out of East Timor with two Transall
aircraft, and treat them at their base. The mission will be paid
for out of the defense budget. If that is not sufficient to last to
the end of 1999, resources from the federal budget will be used. In
the first fire fight between pro-Indonesian militias and the
peacekeepers, two militiamen were killed and two peacekeepers were
wounded.

Schroeder tells IG Metall retirement at 60 can't be financed
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder gave the industry trade union IG Metall no
promises regarding proposals for retirement at age 60. The
Chancellor indicated that the model was basically sound, but at
present could not be accomplished financially. Schroeder wooed the
approximately 600 delegates at IG Metall's union conference, asking
them for a fair evaluation of the government's action so far, which hadn't
had negative social consequences, he said. IG Metall
head Zwickel had previously withdrawn his threat to leave the
"Alliance for Work" if the proposal for retirement at 60 went awry.

IDW says retirement at 60 won't help unemployment situation
</H1>
In the opinion of German Economic Institute (IDW) in Cologne,
retirement at 60 is not a useful instrument in the fight against
unemployment. Shortening people's total working lifetime will
worsen the financial situation of social security, explained the
Institute. In coming years, the number of employed persons will be
reduced. Therefore, more and more workers would have to fund the
old age pensions of an still higher number of pensioners. The
industry think tank instead supported an increase in the ratio of
active workers in the 55 to 64 age bracket.

Further excerpts from Lafontaine's book: alliance with PDS OK
</H1>
Former SPD leader Lafontaine expressed himself in favor of an
alliance between the SPD and the PDS even at the federal level. He
has no problem with the PDS participating in the federal government,
providing one could come to an agreement with it on a common policy,
he wrote in his book "The Heart Beats Left", further excerpts of
which were published today by the newspaper "Die Welt". The
criticism of Lafontaine hasn't let up. Foreign Minister Fischer
spoke of a political and personal tragedy. Nobel Prize winning
author Grass advised Lafontaine to look for a more meaningful
occupation.

Future of Transrapid remains unclear
</H1>
The future of Transrapid, the troubled maglev rail system, remains
uncertain. It appears that there is still no decision following a
meeting by representatives of the government, German Rail, and
industry in Frankfurt. At the meeting, the primary concern was how
and if the system can be operated economically with a single rail
line. According to an estimate of the German Institute for Economic
Research, building even a single line will cost more than the 6.1
billion DM figure provided for in the red/green coalition agreement.
