Geissler: Employment programme must have priority
</H1>
Deputy president of the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag, Heiner Geissler, said
the application of the employment programme must have priority in fixing the
budget problems. It was necessary to reduce labour costs, Geissler stressed
this morning on Deutschlandfunk radio. Thus, benefits that are not directly
related to social insurance should be funded by taxes and not by wage-indexed
contributions. The CDU politician noted, too, that after the latest budget
decisions the coalition has calmed down again.
Last night the leadership of CDU/CSU and FDP approved cuts of DM3bn in the 1997
federal budget as suggested by Finance Minister Theo Waigel. One billion marks
have been cut from Labour Minister's budget alone. In the afternoon, the
factions of the government parties discussed the decisions.

President of Federal Labour Office warns government
</H1>
The President of the Federal Labour Office, Bernhard Jagoda, has warned the
government that it is economizing too much at the expense of the unemployed.
Next year, the unemployment rate will presumably be as high as it is this year,
Jagoda said. Therefore, the expenses of the Federal Labour Office could not be
lowered much. Less support of the job market would lead to more unemployed who,
in turn, would have to receive unemployment benefits.
Deputy president of the National Federation of Unions, Ursula Engelen-Kefer,
said that Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plans were unconstitutional. One
couldn't deduct contributions to the unemployment insurance fund from taxed
income and then tax the gained unemployment benefits a second time.

Questioning of survivors of Luebeck fire disaster
</H1>
In the trial of a Lebanese citizen accused of an arson attack on a Luebeck
hostel for asylum seekers, survivors of the fire in January were questioned
today for the first time. The defendant allegedly started the fire after a
dispute with other occupants of the hostel. This, however, is denied by the
witnesses. In an unemotional statement, a 38-year old Syrian and mother of
three, described the life in the hostel. According to her, she was on friendly
terms with all Arabs. Just hours before the fire, her oldest son had been a
guest of the defendant and his brothers. That night, at around 3.30am, the
Lebanese men helped the woman and her children to get on the roof and out of
danger. Neither the witnessing woman nor her oldest son confirmed that the
defendant allegedly said, "Don't be afraid - it is just a small fire".
