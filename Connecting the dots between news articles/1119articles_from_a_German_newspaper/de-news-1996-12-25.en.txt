Explosion during Christmas service at Frankfurt church
</H1>
An explosion during the Christmas service at a Lutheran church in the
Sindlingen neighbourhood of Frankfurt was most likely tied to a woman's
suicide.  Police said it was a woman of about 30 years of age, but her
exact identity was still unknown, and they could give no indication of her
nationality or motive, although a terrorist connection has been ruled out.
It is suspected that the woman was disturbed and wanted to die a
spectacular death. This morning, investigators instituted a public search
and asked for the public's help; they published a photo of the woman.
According to police, she detonated two grenades at her seat in the third
row from the back, blowing off her lower body, killing three others, and
injuring several others. Most of the injured could be treated on site; ten
were taken to nearby hospitals, some seriously injured. A 12-year-old
girl, a man, and a woman remain in critical condition.

Bishop Lehmann calls for reconciliation in his Christmas sermon
</H1>
The chairman of the German Conference of Bishops, Lehmann, has called in
his Christmas sermon for reconciliation. The bishop, from Mainz, said that
there are not only war and terror in the world, but also - thank God -
frequent signs of reconciliation. Among such signs, Lehmann counts the
German-Czech Declaration, and compromises in the European Union. Bishop
Lehmann calls for reconciliation in Germany between rich and poor, East
and West, and unions and management. He said that Christmas was not
supposed to lull the world into peace for a few hours and to hide
oppositions, only to have it all resume after Christmas; genuine
reconciliation required a genuine will to work together.

Diepgen favours selling state's assets
</H1>
Berlin's Mayor Diepgen has spoken out in favour of the short-term sale of
parts of the state's assets. A member of the CDU, he said in a
conversation with the news agency ddp that the move would represent sound
financial and economic policy. He added that, regardless of the volume of
this sale, the capital would have to shape its long-term budget so that it
would balance out even without such additional income; the long-term goal
must be the consolidation of the budget.

Break-out attempt at Heidelberg prison
</H1>
An attempt to break out of a prison in Heidelberg today was foiled. One
guard was seriously injured when the escaping prisoner struck him down
from behind. Officials think the attempt was carefully planned in advance.
At almost the same time as the above attack was happening, a rope was
thrown over the prison wall from outside. Accomplices were seen on the
wall. The would-be escapee, a 25-year-old man awaiting trial, was
overwhelmed by other guards. His accomplices fled.
