Schaeuble against open stores on Sundays
</H1>
The Chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, Schaeuble, opposes
extending store opening hours to include Sundays. In a newspaper interview
he said, the Commandment of Sunday demands that stores be closed on
Sundays. Schaeuble referred to the Creation story and said that something
that has been in effect for thousands of years almost everywhere, does not
have to be thrown away all of a sudden. Plus, only two months after the
heated discussion about closing hours, the subject should not be brought up
again. The CDU politician disagrees with German Minister of Economics
Rexrodt, who just recently advocated to open stores on Sundays.

Ignaz Bubis' 70th birthday
</H1>
In the opinion of the Chairman of the Central Committee of Jews in Germany,
Bubis, the Jewish Communities should not separate itself from society.
Bubis who is celebrating his 70th birthday today, said that he is trying to
change something within the communities. But one can not forget that there
are holocaust survivors who are still subconsciously afraid. On the other
hand, the Jews can not remain in a ghetto, they have to be part of society
as a whole. That includes being politically and socially active.
Numerous politicians acknowledged Bubis' engagement in Germany in
congratulatory messages. German Chancellor Kohl stressed that Bubis
returned in spite of the pain experienced during the National Socialist
dictatorship, and participated in the building of the Federal Republic of
Germany. Foreign Minister Kinkel called Bubis a persistent reminder and
watchman against forgetting. German President Herzog said, people like
Bubis are responsible for the fact that Germany can last as a democracy.
Bubis has integrated the Jewish community strong and visibly into society
and its daily routine.

Green Party for fight against Scientology with constitutional means
</H1>
Legal politics speaker of Alliance 90/The Greens, Beck, opposes the idea of
withdrawing the status of organization from Scientology. With demands like
that, the organization is driven into illegality, Beck warned today in
Bonn. Also, it gives them an excuse for portraying themselves as victims
and makes more people sympathetic. Alliance 90/The Greens think it is more
effective to fight Scientology with constitutional means and information of
the public. Tax collectors should investigate the financial activities of
the organization. The proposal to withdraw the status of an organization
from Scientology came yesterday from FDP Secretary General Westerwelle.

Green Party demands election statement from SPD
</H1>
Alliance 90/The Greens have renewed their request to the Social
Democratic Party to come up with a clear election statement by the spring
of 1998 at the latest. In an interview with the radio station "SDR",
Managing Director of the parliamentary group, Schulz, said, voters have to
be clear early, whether to decide for a red-green alliance or the Christian
Democratic Union. Black-green discussions don't make sense at this time,
Schulz said. Schulz also welcomed the so-called Woerlitz declaration of his
party against a cooperation and toleration of the Party of Democratic
Socialism.

Diepgen pushes for conference between federal, state and local governments
</H1>
Berlin Mayor Diepgen is pushing for a special conference between federal,
state and local governments to reorganize their financial relationships.
Diepgen also demanded a quick decision about future tax policy in an
interview with the radio station "Deutschlandfunk". Making more and more
new propositions, only undermines the sense of security, which is not
helpful for Germany as a business location. The CDU politician rejected
speculations about a Grand Coalition on the federal level as absurd. What
is happening in some parties left of the Bonn governing coalition is a sign
of complete insecurity. The strength of the PDS shows according to Diepgen
that Germany still faces a number of problems in growing together. Attempts
to reduce the differences between East and West were not successful, and
parties used confrontation between East and West strategically.
