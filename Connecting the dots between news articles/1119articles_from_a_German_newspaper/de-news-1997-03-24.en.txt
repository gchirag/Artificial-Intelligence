Hostile takeover of Thyssen has been resolved
</H1>
The Krupp-Hoesch concern has retracted their hostile takeover bid of their
business rival Thyssen. The plans have in the meantime become outdated,
according to a joint public statement made in Duesseldorf. Apparently,
there will also be no takeover bids for Thyssen in the future. At the same
time, Krupp-Hoesch and Thyssen report that discussions on merging their
steel production are progressing well. According to Thyssen, they will
undertake the management of any future joint steel corporation. The parties
are still looking at areas of possible cooperation outside of their steel
concerns. However, this does not mean that they are considering a merger.

<P>
The Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics have emphasised that they
will still go ahead with the demonstrations as planned tomorrow [Tuesday]
in the banking centre in Frankfurt, despite the retraction of the takeover
bid. The demonstration is to be against the Deutsche Bank, who had been
prepared to approve a loan running into billions of marks to enable
Krupp-Hoesch to obtain a majority shareholding in Thyssen.

<P>
A spokesman for Krupp-Hoesch confirmed that the planned merger of the steel
divisions of the two companies would result in the loss of thousands of
jobs. He said that this would, however, be implemented to cause as little
hardship as possible.

Agreement in the HochTief-Holzmann takeover bid
</H1>
The takeover dispute between the HoechTief and Holzmann building
concerns has taken a friendly turn. Deutsche Bank and HochTief will combine
their shares in the Holzmann concern. This will result in them holding just
under 50 percent of the shares in Holzmann. This news was obtained through
the compulsory statement made at the Frankfurt stock exchange. The three
companies have said that they will make more details public tomorrow.

<P>
The takeover dispute began in the spring of 1994. Since then, HochTief, a
mega-construction company based in Essen, have tried to increase their
holdings in Frankfurt in Holzmann from 20 to almost 35 percent. This,
however, was prohibited by the Federal Anti-Trust Office. HochTief filed a
complaint on which the higher court in Berlin has not yet made a ruling.

Higher contributions for separate public health insurance schemes
</H1>
Almost all of the 20 million who are covered by separate public health
insurance schemes will probably be faced with contribution increases. A
spokesman for the Federal Social Insurance Office in Berlin said to the
Deutschlandfunk radio station that ten of the eleven health insurance
companies concerned had applied for increases to be approved in the last
week. Contributors will also be faced with higher cost shares for medicines
and certain other medical services. The increases, which will only be
effective as from March 11, will be up to 0.8 percent, depending on the
health insurer concerned.

EU states have not agreed on operations in Albania
</H1>
The foreign ministers of the European Union still have not agreed on
military operations in Albania. A spokesman of the European Council in
Brussels said the ministers were still trying to make a compromise. The EU
foreign ministers agree that the distribution of relief aid should be
guarded. A draft declaration in favour of security troops under
international command has already been proposed. Among other issues there
is some controversy whether the UN should be in charge. Delegates indicate
that not only Italy but also France and Greece were willing to send
soldiers to Albania. Germany just wants to provide humanitarian aid.

<P>
The foreign ministers prepared for an expansion of the EU. They invited
those Eastern European countries that wish to join the EU to a conference
in Amsterdam in June. The EU summit taking place 10 days before that
conference will decide on details of the joining.

Talks about future nuclear policy without results
</H1>
The federal government and the SPD postponed their talks about the future
nuclear policy without results. In Bonn Federal Minister of Environment
Angela Merkel and State Premier of Lower Saxony Gerhard Schroeder declared
energy supply companies should join further talks after Easter.

<P>
While Merkel claimed having achieved substantial progress, Schroeder said
crucial questions were still controversial. The federal government still
insisted on further exploitation of nuclear energy, while the
Social-Democrats decline that. SPD federal secretary-general Muentefering
who attended the discussion at the Chancellor's Office as well, said these
issues were not under negotiations.

Banks liable for bad consulting
</H1>
When a bank induces an inexperienced client to speculate with borrowed
money the bank must share the losses. The Federal High Court confirmed a
corresponding ruling by the Saarbruecken Higher Regional Court. In the
present case a bank consultant of Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank
had recommended a client to take a credit of DM1 million to buy securities
and shares. Instead of a promised gain the client had incurred more than
DM400,000 in debts when the portfolio was dissolved after four years. The
bank must now pay two thirds of the debt, one third the client.
