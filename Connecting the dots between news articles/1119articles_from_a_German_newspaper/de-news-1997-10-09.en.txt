Bundestag: Debate on Postal Monopoly, Solidarity Surcharge, and Wire Tapping
</H1>
Tonight the Bundestag (lower house of the parliament) eventually decided to
give up the monopoly of the German Postal Service. In a roll-call vote 313
representatives voted for the reform, while 279 rejected it.
In the debate members of the opposition at times heavily criticized the
government's bill. A deterioration of service and the loss of jobs were to
be feared. The new law provides that from January 1, 1998 on competitors
may also distribute letters, in addition to parcels which they already may
distribute. The Postal Service will only keep a monopoly for standard
letters weighing less than 100g. The Social Democrats (SPD) vowed to veto
and thereby kill the reform in the Bundesrat (upper house of the
parliament).

<P>
Earlier, the Bundestag resolved a lowering of the solidarity surcharge.
The reduction from 7.5 to 5.5 per cent beginning on January 1, 1998 means a
relief for tax payers of about DM7 billion. It will be financed mainly
through postponements in refunds granted by the Debt Redemption Fund.

At the first hearing on the "Grand Bugging Attack" an interfactional
consensus about the compromise of the governing coalition and the
Social-Democrats (SPD) emerged.

In the debate on the 7th anniversary of the German Reunification speakers

Kidnapped Matthias Hintze found dead
</H1>
Matthias Hintze from Brandenburg, who had been kidnapped three weeks ago,
was found dead in a soil dug-out where he had been held prisoner. The exact
cause of death, however, can no longer be determined. The 20-year-old man
died probably due to lack of either air, water, or food. The interrogation
of the two Russian suspects is expected to reveal further information. The
police found the corpse that was already heavily decomposing, in a
four-meter-deep hole in the ground. One of the two suspects showed the
officers to the crime site located in a forest area near Wahren,
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. Hintze had been
kidnapped on September 14 in front of his parents' house. The kidnappers
demanded a ransom of DM1 million.

Fiszman Trial: Accusations back and forth
</H1>
In the trial on the kidnapping and murder of the Frankfurt millionaire Jakub
Fiszman, the accused Rainer Koerppen denied any connection with the case. In
his statement he instead incriminated his son Sven. Sven had confessed the
crime to him, said the 49-year-old suspect. He himself had only buried the
ransom and cleared all traces in order to protect his son and himself. Sven
Koerppen, who is charged with aiding and abetting the crime, confessed to
have kidnapped Fiszman together with his father, but said he did not know
anything about the murder.
