</H1>
UNO Secretary General Annan has welcomed the establishment of the
International Criminal Court for the investigation and prosecution of
genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and aggression. Annan
spoke at the signing ceremony in Rome and spoke of a giant step for
more justice. The delegates of 120 states voted in favor of the
establishment of the Criminal Court in the Hague, Netherlands. Seven
countries - including the USA, China, India and Libya - voted against
the statute. They felt the tribunal will have too much power.

the Court had more authority. Kinkel said in the German radio station
"Deutschlandfunk" that the agreement is nonetheless historic, and he
believes that ratification of the statute will occur quickly.

</H1>
The SPD wants to discuss the Eurofighter again should they win the
elections. The speaker for defense politics Kollbow (sp?) said in the
Cologne newspaper "Sonntagsexpress" that the government had decided to
purchase 180 new fighter planes against the will of the Social Democrats.
375 million Marks from the 1999 budget were allotted for the purchase alone.
The Eurofighters cost the taxpayers approximately 30 billion Marks or more.
In order to save money, new ways could probably be found to purchase fewer
Eurofighters.
