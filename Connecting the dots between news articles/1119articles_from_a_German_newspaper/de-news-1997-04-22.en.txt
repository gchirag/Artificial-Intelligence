Economic research institutes predict slower growth
</H1>
The six leading economic research institutes have presented their spring
forecasts for the German economy. The experts expect reduced economic
growth. They predict that the German economy will grow by 2.25 percent.
Last fall their prediction was still 2.5 percent. The experts also predict
an average of 4.3 million unemployed, that is 300,000 more than in 1996.
This contrasts with government predictions of 4.1 million unemployed for
1997. The institutes criticize the indecisive tax debate. There was no
clear direction detectable, this was one reason why investors waited with
their decisions. Quick decisions in tax politics could improve the German
tax climate.

Comments on economic spring forecast
</H1>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel stated that the spring forecast showed the
conditions for an economic upswing remained bad. The federal government
would do everything to reduce the deficit to 3.0 percent of the gross
national product and meet the criteria to join monetary union. According to
forecasts by economic research institutes, Germany will miss the deficit
criterion by 0.2 percent. They assume, however, that Germany will join the
European Monetary Union at its start in 1999 even though it may miss the
criteria by a small margin.

<P>
Economics Minister Guenther Rexrodt said the reforms must be put into
action as quickly as possible. The SPD spokesperson for economic policy,
Mr. Schwanholt (sp?), however called the forecast a slap in the face of
Finance Minister Theo Waigel. The prognosis of 2.25 percent growth rejected
unmistakably the government's window dressing. The Social-Democrats' main
reproach is: the spring forecast made clear that still no new jobs have
been created in spite of economic upswing. Theo Waigel whose economics
policy has been praised today by leading economists seemed relaxed and
assured that Germany would not miss the start of monetary union.

Federal cabinet passes tax reform
</H1>
The federal cabinet has passed the bill for the tax reform this morning. It
will be debated as soon as Friday in the Bundestag. The bill is 400 pages
thick and provides a net tax reduction. Effects for individuals remain
unclear because tax benefits are supposed to be eliminated at the same
time. There are also plans for increasing consumption taxes to finance the
reform. The entry income tax will be reduced from 25.9 to 15 percent, the
maximum tax from 53 to 39 percent. Waigel admitted that he cannot make any
exact statements about the extent of the budget deficit.

Europe to fight more strongly criminal goods transports
</H1>
European transportation ministers agreed at a conference in Berlin to fight
crime related to cross-border goods transports. German Transportation
Minister Matthias Wissmann said customs fraud has cost EU member states a
minimum of DM750 million during 1990-1994. Without counter-measures,
increasing crime would slow quick and unbureaucratic border controls. The
ministers also recommended to ship more goods by rail than by road.

services, akin to American Consumer Union that publishes Consumer Reports]

private banks offer better advice than state-owned public banks. The
services of private building and loan associations were also better than in
the previous test three years ago. Of 20 tested banks eight were rated
good, the remaining did worse. Five banks were rated poor. The top banks
were HUK Coburg, Schwaebisch-Hall, BHW, and LBS Wuerttemberg. Among those
rated poor were Deutscher Ring, Wuestenrot, and LBS Rhineland-Palatinate.

Alcatel employees protest against plans to close factory

many workers left their work place several hours early after a workers
general assembly. Workers' council chair Mr. Schwab stated there was no
reason to close the plant because there was no lack of offers for 1997 and
several offers have already been secured for 1998.

Kinkel criticizes expulsion policy of federal states
</H1>
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has again criticized the federal states
because of their way of expelling Bosnian refugees. In a newspaper
interview Kinkel said it was important that the people not simply be handed
over in Sarajevo. The state interior ministers ought to find a common plan
for the repatriation. For this a special commissioner should be installed.
CDU politician Christian Schwartz-Schilling called the states' repatriation
policy simple-minded, heartless, and ignorant and one that was carried out
on the back of the refugees.
Meanwhile, Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic joined the discussion about
the repatriation of Bosnian war refugees by massively attacking Bosnian
Serbs. In a letter to member states of the EU Izetbegovic complained the
Serbs did not keep appointments. This would put the whole package of
treaties at risk.
