Arbitration talks in farming industry in final round
</H1>
Arbitration talks in the contract dispute in the farming
industry are in their final round. The mediator, a CDU politician by the
name of Heiner Geissler wants to announce a decision by midnight tonight.
The union (IG Bauen, Agrar-Umwelt) is demanding a wage increase of 2.9
percent, as well as 100 percent pay in case of illness. However, it is
prepared to accept the short-term sacrifice of part of the "thirteenth
month's" pay (Christmas bonus). Employers, on the other hand, want a zero
increase, the thirteenth month's pay halved, and sick pay cut to 80
percent of full pay, as allowed by law. If there is no settlement, the
union is threatening industrial action.

Suessmuth calls for a quick settlement of pension reform
</H1>
Bundestag President Suessmuth has called for a speedy agreement on
the issue of pension reform. In a newspaper interview, the CDU politician
said that a compromise between the Coalition and the SPD was indeed within
the realm of the possible. Suessmuth recommended to her own party that it
be willing to discuss the reform of the surviving dependents' pension. The
same went for making so-called "DM 610 jobs" subject to social security
deductions. In return, Suessmuth said, the Social Democrats must accept
cuts in order to save money. She also said that people these days do not
view parliament and the government very highly; so anyone trying to turn
problems into election issues, rather than to solve them, would only
increase voters' distrust.
Federal Employment Minister Bluem expressed similar sentiments on ARD
television. He assured viewers that he would do everything possible to
reach an agreement about pensions. SPD leader Scharping, on the other
hand, has expressed skepticism about the chances of negotiations with the
Coalition. As a prerequisite for such talks, he said that the CDU/CSU and
FDP must abandon the idea of lowering pension levels.

Kohl not expecting a change in direction of labour market
</H1>
Wellington, New Zealand. Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed
reservations about the chances of a quick reduction in unemployment. No
reversal in the current trend is expected in the labour market for 1997.
Nevertheless, Kohl told journalists in Wellington, he was sticking to the
goal of halving unemployment by the year 2000. The Chancellor, on a trip
to Asia, stopped in the New Zealand capital. The dominant theme of his
visit is the economy. Following wide-sweeping reforms, many consider New
Zealand to be a model for other Western countries, with relatively low
unemployment, and a high growth rate. Its national budget is running
surplus.

Post office and Postbank sign agreement
</H1>
Bonn.. The post office and the Postbank have signed the agreement over
future cooperation, which has been under dispute for several months. The
Postal Ministry made the announcement. The central issue in the agreement
is the joint use of postal outlets by the two corporations. The Postbank
will pay more than DM 1.1 billion this year for the privilege. The post
office has agreed to leave at least 12,000 of its current 16,000 branches
operating until the year 2000, and at least 10,000 after that. The
agreement also paves the way for the privatization of the Postbank. The
State plans to sell 75 percent of the bank before the end of this year.

5 years' imprisonment in fatal-injection trial
</H1>
The Regional Court has sentenced a nurse to 5 years' imprisonment
in the "fatal injection" trial. The 42-year-old injected a cancer patient
with an overdose of sedative 3 years ago. As the judgement was announced,
the accused collapsed in tears. One judge, Gottfried Held, said the court
would have preferred to acquit her, but the judges could not overlook the
facts. The court believed the testimony of one witness who described the
accused twice injecting the terminally ill 85-year-old patient with a
sedative. It has not been determined whether the sedative was the only
cause of death, but the accused has been found guilty of at least
attempted murder. The defence will appeal the ruling.

Suedmilch dairy boss refuses to testify in Suedmilch trial
</H1>
Former boss of the Suedmilch dairy, Staudacher, has refused to
testify in the Suedmilch trial. The 58-year-old justified his refusal
before the Regional Court in Stuttgart with reference to the preliminary
proceedings in progress against him, on suspicion of disloyalty.
Two former dairy managers are facing the court on charges of deception and
disloyalty. According to the accused, Staudacher is also partly
responsible for the bankruptcy of the Sachsenmilch dairy in 1993, because
he stopped Suedmilch's support of the East German daughter company.
