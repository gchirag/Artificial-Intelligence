Foreign Minister Fischer announces prosecution of Kosovo war criminals
</H1>
Federal Foreign Affairs Minister Joschka Fischer has announced that Kosovo
war criminals will be mercilessly prosecuted. He said that no exceptions
would be made in the handing over of all war criminals to the War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague. In Fischer's words: "There, justice will be done. Not
revenge, but justice." Those accused of war crimes include Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic. Fischer, like American President Bill Clinton,
did not seem surprised that ethnic Albanians are repeatedly engaging in acts
of vengeance against Serbs in Kosovo. He said that was to be expected, given
the atrocities that Albanians found when they returned home. Fischer said
that the most important task for the future was the establishment of
democratic structures in the war-torn region.

Yugoslavian leaders had obviously planned the expulsion of the
Kosovo-Albanians very carefully. According to a report in the British
newspaper "The Observer", NATO has secured documents confirming the details.
The papers, left behind as the Yugoslavian Army pulled out of Kosovo, list
the cities and towns in which the expulsion began.

New Telekom shares worth 39.5 euros come on the market
</H1>
The second batch of Deutsche Telekom shares to be released on the stock
market will cost 39.50 euros each, equivalent to 77.26 DM. The Telekom
company made the announcement one day before the shares are made available
for trading. Those who ordered the new shares early, or own old shares, will
receive a rebate of two euros. According to the Telekom's financial officer,
Joachim Kroeske, the offering was oversubscribed and so had to be rationed.
Those who ordered 50 shares will still receive 50 shares, but those who
wanted 100 shares will only receive 72.
This second release of shares is expected to bring in approximately 20
billion DM for the Telekom.

No legal objections to Catholic pregnancy counselling certificate
</H1>
Federal Justice Minister, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, does not see any legal
objections to Catholic pregnancy counselling certificates. According to the
minister, all that matters is that the counselling service be recognized by
the state, and that a given counselling session be documented by means of an
official certificate. She said that any further information on the
certificate was not relevant to the law.
The certificates issued by Catholic pregnancy counselling centres will in
future carry an addendum saying that they may not be used to obtain a legal
abortion.
