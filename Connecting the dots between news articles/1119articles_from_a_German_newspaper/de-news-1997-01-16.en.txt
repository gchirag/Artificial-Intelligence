Rhineland-Palatinate has to pay damages to RWE
</H1>
The Constitutional Court has reached a verdict in the lawsuit regarding
the shut-down of the nuclear power plant at Muehlheim-Kehrlich.  The
judges of Karlsruhe have upheld the damage claim and fixed the recompense
at DM 1.5 billion.  It is now for the lower court, the Karlsruhe Higher
Regional Court, to decide what amount of payment the state of
Rhineland-Palatinate is obliged to.  However, the ruling by the
Constitutional Court requires an investigation as to whether RWE is
partially responsible that a preliminary permit of operation for the power
plant was issued, even though in 1988 it turned out that the permit had
been illegal.  The finding reached today furthermore states that RWE is
not entitled to damages in all the points it had filed for.

</H1>
In unanimous vote, the Senior Council of the Bundestag has exonerated
Parliamentary President Ms. Suessmuth from accusations of having used the
air transportation corps of the Bundeswehr for private purposes.  The
Council thereby endorsed the report by Parliamentary Vice President Klose.
Mr. Klose (SPD) had investigated the charges against Ms. Suessmuth in

the Bundeswehr's air transportation service.  The so-called risk analysis
of politicians has to be brought up-to-date.  The security authorities
estimate to what extent a Member of Parliament is at risk and may hence
use Bundeswehr aircraft for transportation.
