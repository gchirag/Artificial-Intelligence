</H1>
The president of the Federal Labour Office, Bernhard Jagoda, demanded from
businesses to show more initiative in the battle against unemployment.

lack of instruments for creating new jobs because companies had saved
expenses in the amount of DM 30 million through legal changes alone. Yet,

SPD Demands Corrections to Grand Surveillance Attack
</H1>
The SPD attempts to obtain corrections in the upper house of parliament
(Bundesrat) regarding the grand surveillance attack bill. Oskar Lafontaine,
head of the SPD, announced during a meeting of the executive board in Bonn
that Bremen and Rhineland-Palatinate would file respective petitions with
their state representations. The goal consisted in protecting certain
professional groups such as doctors, lawyers, and journalists, from the
proposed measures. It is still not known whether the coalition of SPD and
CDU in Bremen will abstain from voting in the upper house of parliament. If
a two-thirds majority cannot be reached in the upper house, it would be
necessary to engage the mediation committee.

communication. According to the declaration, the "Sudetendeutsche
Landsmannschaften" (Association of Sudeten Germans) will send two
representatives to the committee. The Sudeten Germans had insisted on this

Stolpe Expects Schroeder to Run for Chancellor
</H1>
The State Premier of Brandenburg, Manfred Stolpe, expects Oskar Lafontaine,
head of the SPD, to nominate the State Premier of Lower Saxony, Gerhard
Schroeder, as the candidate for chancellor if Schroeder manages to defend
his absolute majority in the state elections. Stolpe said in an interview
with a Berlin newspaper that Lafontaine considers a victory by the SPD in
the federal elections to be more important than his personal career. Based
on this, Schroeder would not automatically be dismissed as candidate for
chancellor if the Social Democrats were to achieve less favourable results
in Lower Saxony during the March elections.
