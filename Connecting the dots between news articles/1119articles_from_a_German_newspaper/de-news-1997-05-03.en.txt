Simonis criticizes SPD timetable for naming Chancellor candidate
</H1>
The Premier of Scleswig-Holstein, Simonis, criticized the plan for naming the
SPD Chancellor's candidate that the party leadership has come up with. No decision on the time line should have been reached, Simonis said in the newspaper
"Bild am Sonntag". The adequate date could just as easily be in early 1998,
before springtime. The state leader supported the right of the party leader to
suggest candidates. The leadership of the SPD had agreed to name the candidate
to oppose Chancellor Kohl immediately after the Lower Saxon state elections in
spring 1998.

Government keeping to reduction of the solidarity surcharge
</H1>
The Federal government has refused the requests of eastern politicians in the
Union parties to question again the plan to reduce the solidarity surcharge at
the beginning of 1998. The coalition is much more concerned with its goal of
reducing entrepreneurial taxes in January 1998, said Minister of the Federal
offices Bohl in the "Chemnitzer Freie Presse". This group would include the
solidarity surcharge.
The representitive of the CDU delegates from eastern Germany, Krueger, showed
understanding of the position of the government. The solidarity surcharge applies in an equal and undifferentiated manner to everyone, including businesses,
Krueger said on "Deutschlandradio Berlin". In the present economic environment
a reduction of the solidarity surcharge would not be a good idea, said Krueger.

Government plans clarifying action on currency union
</H1>
The Federal government is planning a public relations campaign on behalf
of the currency union. Minister of the Federal offices Bohl said in a newspaper
interview that the public is afraid of the change from the Mark to the Euro.
This fear is ungrounded, according to Bohl, because the economic integration
of Europe will contribute to the security of peace and will also help secure
millions of jobs.

Criticism of the planned cost shift from sickness insurance to health care
</H1>
The President of the Federal League of Doctors, Wilmar, criticized the plans
to shift costs from sickness to health insurance. In an interview with the
"Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung", he said some who needed care would require help
from social security funds. The delineation lists, drawn up by health insurers
and their doctors have little to do with the worth of people, according to him.
Financially well-off clients will, in the future, be expected to bear the cost
of such proceedures as insulin injections or blood pressure tests. Wilmar said
that this seemed to be a case where money, rather than those requiring the most
care, was given the most importance.

exports to Iraq. According to information from the "Bild-Zeitung" they are said
to have supported the armaments industry in Iraq. In particular the 16 firms

the Scud missle program. The newspaper based its story on a reputable report
from the Federal government. A spokesperson for the Federal Economic Ministry

March.

Landlords' union demands raise in rent
</H1>
The German Landlords' Union has demanded a raise in rent. The director of
the Union, Ripp, if the socially supported rent level would be raised to match
the comparison rent, this would raise the level of every rent as a result. The
rent level has not been equalized since 1990. The Landlords' Union fears that
they will exhaust the social apparatus for construction. The organization finds
conversely that Federal Construction Minister Toepfer's suggestion for a deposit to cover false reservations to be a good one. They also plan on a surcharge
for renters with high incomes in social buildings.

28 journalists killed in the last year
</H1>
No fewer than 28 journalists were killed worldwide in the last year in
the pursuit of their vocation, according to a report from the committee "Reporters Without Frontiers" commemorating today's Day of Press Freedom. A speaker
for the organization said that in reality the number was much higher, but the
verification of cases was often difficult. Although the end of the war in the
former Yugoslavia means that there aren't so many martyrs among journalists
there, it still appears to be a bad situation for press freedom around the
world. More than half of the members of the United Nations do not respect press
freedom. According to the report journalists are often persecuted and killed
in Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, in Turkey and in the successor states
to the Soviet Union.
