Schily wants to stop further immigration
</H1>
Otto Schily, the German Minister of the Interior, is against the
immigration of more foreigners. In an interview with the paper the
"Berliner Tagesspiegel" Mr. Schily said that the stress through
immigration is already too great. He said that legislation on immigration
would not change anything about that as the quota for immigration should
be set at zero. He continued that  European solution has to be found for
asylum seekers and civil war refugees. The greatest danger for the
stability of Germany is right wing extremism which is increasing among
teenagers. He said that it is true that the police do not always
prosecute members of right-wing extremist gangs which he considered an
alarming situation.

Green Party for end of observation of the PDS
</H1>
The Greens are of the opinion that there should be no more observation of
the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) by the German Domestic
Intelligence Agency. The speaker of the Green Parliamentary Group on
legal issues, Mr. Beck, does not think further observation is necessary
because the observation only casts the successor party of the Socialist
Unity Party of Germany (SED) into the role of victim. According to Mr.
Beck, a general discussion about the value of the observation of enemies
of the constitution by the Domestic Intelligence Agency should be
initiated. Minister of the Interior Schily had declared several days ago
that he will look into current investigations of the PDS.

Concerns about PDS
</H1>
Gauck, the Commissioner for Stasi documents (East Germany's former
Secret Police) thinks it is a problematic development that the PDS is
participating in the government of Mecklenburg-Pomerania. Mr. Gauck told
the weekly "Bild am Sonntag" that he considers it a problem if government
positions are filled prematurely with people who have not fully broken
with the past. He said that the PDS is an ecosystem for those who have
not arrived at democracy. He thinks that red-red coalitions in East
Germany will be the consequence. Mr. Gauck gave assurances that his
agency will continue to exist for another 20 to 30y ears. At the moment,
the agency receives 10,000 inquiries from citizens each month.

USA to return Stasi documents
</H1>
Politicians from Social Democratic Party (SPD) and the Christian
Social Union (CSU) have asked the US government to return all documents
stolen from the former East German  Secret Police during the "Wende"
(change). So far, the position of the USA on this issue was more that of
a superior power than that of a friendly partner said Mr. Penner, the
Chairman of the Bundestag Committee on interior politics. Mr. Zeitelmann,
a CSU politician  said that the refusal of the USA to return the
documents was unacceptable and arrogant. During the dissolution of the
Honecker regime, the US Secret Service had stolen documents and removed
them to the USA. Mr. Gauck's agency needs the documents to solve cases of
injustice and repression in the former East Germany.
