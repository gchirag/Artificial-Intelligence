Green Party convention
</H1>
During the Green Party convention that ended today [Sunday], Gunda Roestel,
who was re-elected Speaker of the Executive Board, stressed that the Greens
have to emphasize their own policies in the red-green government. In
particular, the impression has to be corrected that talks between
government, employers, economy and unions for an Alliance for Work are a
project of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) alone. Mrs. Roestel also
demanded that women and unemployed people be included in the negotiations
for the Alliance for Work. The Green Party wants to strengthen its position
as a party of government by reforming the party structures. In the Party
Council elected during the convention, green politicians from the federal
and state levels will coordinate party and government politics.

Dispute over Mr. Geissler's words continues
</H1>
The dispute within the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) over statements by
former CDU Secretary General Heiner Geissler concerning dealings with the
Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) continues. Mr. Geissler today reacted to
criticism from his own party and accused his opponents of distorting the
facts. He stressed that he never demanded active cooperation with the PDS.
He said that it is possible to cooperate on certain points, without forming
a coalition. The Vice President of the Union Parties in the Bundestag (Lower
House) Mr. Luther, had in the name of the 42 East German delegates demanded
that Mr. Geissler be excluded from the party and the parliamentary fraction.
Mr. Geissler objected that a vote was never held on the legitimacy of Mr.
Luther as spokesman for the East German delegates.

According to Minister of Employment Mr. Riester, a fundamental decision will
be taken at the beginning of next year with regard to the issue of
additional pensions. The Minister declared on "ZDF" TV that a committee of
the participants involved in the negotiations about an Alliance for Work
will present their results by then. Mr. Riester maintains that all
participants agree that this subject is worth dealing with. The President of
the Employers' Association, Mr. Hundt, stressed that what is at stake is not
only a pension starting at 60 for everybody, but boosting part-time
retirement as well.

Protective imprisonment for under-age criminal offenders
</H1>
The Police Union has proposed protective imprisonment for under-age criminal
offenders. The President of the union, Mr. Spinnrad, said in a newspaper

sixteen-year-old had been sentenced several times before and had just been
released from prison.

Family drama
</H1>
In Bavaria, a family drama cost the lives of three people. According to
police, a father first shot his 59-year-old wife and his 29-year-old son,
then himself. The shootings were apparently triggered by a family argument.
After shooting his family, the 60-year-old barricaded himself inside the
house. Psychologists, as well as a special police team, tried for more than
three hours to talk the man into giving up. However, when they stormed the
detached family house, police found the body of the man.
