Warning strikes in printing industry continue
</H1>
Warning strikes have been continued in the printing
industry. Many newspapers appeared only in emergency editions or in a form
far slimmer than usual. According to the union involved, approximately 200
businesses around Germany are being affected by the protest. Wage
negotiations for the 130,000 people employed in the industry were broken
off Tuesday night after only 2 hours, and postponed. Negotiations were
resumed today, and the union IG Medien issued an ultimatum to the
employers to come to an agreement.. Union leader Hentsche said that the
positions of labour and management had diverged again. The primary
sticking point in the negotiations is evidently sick pay. According to a
spokesman for the union, the employers association is demanding too much
in compensation for continued full sick pay.

Continued disunity in CDU over pension reform
</H1>
Disputes within the CDU over plans for pension reforms continue. At
a meeting of the party executive, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, concern
was expressed against a familial fund financed by taxes. After the
meeting, Party Secretary Hintze said that no decision had been made, but
that the executive had approved of the chancellor's suggested time-plan.
He added that there was agreement on the goals of the reforms, namely: to
lower working costs, to lower the government's share, and to ensure secure
pensions, with a fair sharing of the burden between all generations.
Hintze also said there was a broad agreement to reform the pension system
quickly, but without haste. The existing system is to be developed, not
radically restructured, proceeding from the basis of suggestions from the
commission of experts led by Federal Employment Minister Bluem. Hintze
said that the discussion of alternative suggestions was still possible.
Meanwhile, the SPD finds the likelihood of a mutually acceptable
compromise with the coalition on pension reform to be very small. Leader
of the SPD parliamentary group, Scharping, gave some prerequisites for
even opening discussions, including abandoning the ideas of taxing
pensions any more and of lowering the pensions themselves to 64 percent.
Scharping also added the conditions that secondary wage costs be lowered,
that a minimal pension level for everyone be introduced, and that the move
into old-age benefits be made more flexible.

Grundig headed for bankruptcy?
</H1>
Leading managers at the Grundig company have emphatically rejected
speculations of a coming bankruptcy. The chairman of the board of
directors, Schwarz-Schilling, said that the company had sufficient
financial reserves, and was in very close contact with its banks, in order
to work out a medium-term financial plan. He said that anyone who -
obviously without grounds - cast aspersions on Grundig's ability to pay
its bills was seriously damaging the company and its employees. Earlier, a
financial expert, Stein, commissioned by the board of directors, had said
that Grundig would be insolvent in April if financial demands in the
amount of 200 million marks could not be met, for which the company lacked
sufficient internal capital. The union IG Metall has also denied rumours
of impending bankruptcy at the company.

Record unemployment likely in January
</H1>
Experts expect January to bring a new record high in the number
of unemployed in Germany, with levels that will exceed the worst fears.
One day before the release of the official employment numbers for January,
experts were predicting an increase in unemployment levels by about a half
a million people, to approximately 4.6 million. Only in construction work
is an increase expected, by 150,000 over December levels, to 400,000.
Earlier estimates anticipated 4.4 million unemployed Germans in January.
The primary reason for the increases was given as seasonal factors. The

overwhelming and shocking.

Holzmann boss arrested for bribery
</H1>
The chairman of the board of directors of Germany's second-largest
construction company, Philipp Holzmann Held und Franke, 54-year-old Dieter
Schneider, has been arrested. He is strongly suspected of having bribed an
employee of the management company responsible for the southern autobahn,
in connection with a spectacular construction scandal. The case goes back
to a time when Schneider was an employee at the construction company
Strabag, and then later the managing director at Radner Bau AG. According
to the criminal police in Munich, Schneider organized price cartels with
other companies. The companies are suspected of having regularly bribed
public officials in order to get internal documents on public tenders,
which they then used to drive up prices, to the detriment of taxpayers. In
the case of Schneider, the contracts in question are valued at a total of
300 million marks, the amount defrauded in the tens of millions of marks.
According to the prosecutor, evidence of bribery has been found in the
construction of public buildings, the Munich subway, and autobahn projects
in Bavaria.

Annulment of construction wage contracts in the East disallowed
</H1>
The Labour Court in Wiesbaden has decided that the annulment
without notice of the eastern German construction wage contracts from last
year is not valid. The court is forcing the German building contractors'
association to try to influence its member companies to respect the
current contract which expires in March. The eastern German construction
industry last summer cancelled the contract which had only been negotiated
in April, blaming the catastrophic economic situation in the construction
market in the East.

Baden-Wurttemberg budget passed
</H1>
Over the objections of the Opposition, the landtag in
Baden-Wurttemberg has passed the state's 1997 budget. It encompasses a
total economic activity worth 62 billion marks and foresees savings of
almost 3 billion. The anticipated deficit amounts to 1.6 billion marks, or
about 100 million less than last year. Finance Minister Mayer-Vorfelder,
CDU, said the state government could be proud of continuing the
consolidation of its finances in a difficult time. Speakers for the
Opposition criticized cuts to the local councils and in the areas of
welfare and the environment. SPD member Brechtgen said that cuts to
student transportation would affect primarily middle-class families, and
would erect politico-educational barriers.
