German-Spanish summit in El Escobar
</H1>
Spain and Germany will closely harmonize their economic policies in view
of the single European currency. This is the result of a summit meeting
between the Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar and Chancellor Helmut
Kohl in the historic monastic residence San Lorenzo del Escorial
near Madrid. Mr. Aznar stressed that Spain is fulfilling perfectly the
criteria
for joining the currency union. The German government acknowledged that
both Spain and Portugal were ready for the Euro [the future common
European currency]. Kohl stated that the German general elections in
September were also a vote on the introduction of the Euro. At the same
time Kohl categorically rejected questions about the costs of the planned
extension of the European Union. The integration of central and east
European states was about creating a new peace order and not about
money. Spain and other south European countries are afraid that they will
receive less subsidies from Brussels after an EU extension.
Aznar confirmed his government's intention to buy 235 German Leopard
tanks worth 3.8 billion DM. Details about the deal are still being
negotiated.
Kohl and Aznar were also content with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan's
mediation results in Baghdad. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stated,
however, that the danger of war in Iraq is not over yet in his
opinion. Kinkel expected that the UN Security Council will accept the
result achieved by Annan. Iraq, however, had to prove that it follows the
agreement to the point.

Calls for a new Alliance for Employment
</H1>
More and more members of CDU and CSU want immediate, new
negotiations on an Alliance for Employment, contrary to the wishes of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. President of the Christian-Democratic Workers
(CDW) Eppelmann called on Germany's two main churches, the Catholic
and Protestant Church, to initiate new talks as quickly as possible. The
churches, however, declined immediately. The parliamentary CDU/CSU
employees group called on unions, government and
industry to make an immediate start on negotiations for a new Alliance for
Employment. If the negotiations were delayed until after the general
elections in September millions of unemployed would suffer another eight
months of hopelessness. Last weekend Kohl said that he was not against such
an Alliance. On the other hand it was clear that it would not be an
election campaign topic.
