No breakthrough at tax summit
</H1>
No breakthrough was reached even after the second tax summit
round between the coalition government and the SPD. Both sides,
however, agreed on another meeting next week conducted by Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and head of SPD Oskar Lafontaine. After today's talks at
the Chancellor's Office, Mr Lafontaine said he believed settling the
dispute was now possible. The Chancellor stressed the coalition and
the SPD had to make all efforts to come to an agreement. He could not
forecast the outcome, though, added Mr Kohl.

<P>
The main point of controversy seems to be still the refinancing of
the planned tax reform. Mr Lafontaine pointed out that, in his opinion,
the loss in revenues has not been properly taken care of in the concept
of the coalition government, yet.

<P>
Finance Minister Theo Waigel claimed the Social Democrats were
overestimating the loss in revenues caused by the tax reform and that
they have not taken into account the reform's effects in stimulating
growth and the creation of new jobs.

DGB rejects 32-hour work week
</H1>
The German federation of unions (DGB) opposes head of IG
Metall union Klaus Zwickel's plan to reduce the weekly working time to
32 hours. DGB head, Mr Schulte, said at an employers meeting in Baden-Baden
that with the plan for a 4-day working week an "avant-garde aiming point"
for the inner-union discussion has been set. Hardly any unionist was so
unrealistic to still see a chance for any schematic working time regulation.
Independantly from this discussion, however, all necessary changes of
the unions' working time policies had to be done now, such as the reduction
of over-time, the increase of the number of part-time jobs with social
insurance or for semi-retired persons, Mr Schulte added.

government to have ordered the murder of four Kurdish opposition politicians.

Hundt demands state subsidised wages for simple jobs
</H1>
President of the employers' association, Mr Hundt, advocates state
subsidies for low-payed, simple jobs. Thousands of jobs could be created
if wages for this kind of jobs were decreased by 25 to 30 per cent, said
Mr Hundt to the journal "Stern", published in Hamburg. These low wages could
be topped up by social welfare payments. This could considerably decrease
social welfare payments because people who now receive full welfare would
have to be paid only partial welfare, the employers' association's president
added.

Seehofer: Doctors should not be over-cautious in prescribing cures
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Horst Seehofer has asked physicians
not to be over-cautious in prescribing cures. It now seems, that after
calls for cuts on health care spending, the existing budget for cures
will hardly be used up, Mr Seehofer said in Wiesbaden. Especially the
Muetter-Genesungswerk organisation [Agency for Convalescing Mothers]
has now many free places although the cures they offer are not affected
at all by the saving measures.

High unemployment assistance payments
</H1>
The Federal Labour Office payed out almost six billion mark
in unemployment assistance in the first three months of the year. This
is an increase of almost DM800mio compared to the first quarter of 1996.
According to the autority, the first quarter payments reflect a third
of this year's budget for unemployment assistance. The SPD called
long-time unemployment an "explosive charge" for the budget.

Slight drop in consumer prices in March
</H1>
Consumer prices in Germany fell by 0.2 per cent in March
compared to February. According to details from the Federal Department
of Statistics, this was a result of seasonal decrease in the cost of
fuel oil and fresh groceries. However, in comparison to March 1996, there
has actually been a price increase of 1.5 per cent.  The statisticians
believe that rent prices, which rose by 2.7 per cent during the report
time, were the main cause of the increase.

Continued interest in Stasi files
</H1>
Joachim Gauck, Federal Commissioner for the Stasi files, the
files of the former East German secret service, has pointed out the
continuing interest in dealing with East German history. Five years
after the law concerning the access to the Stasi files came into effect,
Mr Gauck said on Deutschlandfunk radio that every month his authority
receives 15,000 to 20,000 new demands from people who want to have a look
at their files. This proves that it has been right to open the archives.
According to what he said, some 935,000 demands of private persons have
been processed up to now.

Second largest regional center of the ARD set up in south west Germany
</H1>
In south west Germany, the second largest regional center
within the ARD public broadcasting group will be set up in the next
couple of years. The new station, result of merging the two stations
"Suedwestfunk (SWF)" and "Sueddeutscher Rundfunk (SDR)", will be called
"Suedwestrundfunk (SWR)". A corresponding treaty was paraphed by the State
Premiers of Rhineland-Palatinate and Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Beck and
Mr Teufel, today. The treaty now has to pass the parliaments of the
two states.

<P>
It is the intention of the two state governments, that separate TV channels
with mostly cultural and educational content will be produced in each
capital, Mainz and Stuttgart. Further, each city will produce two radio
channels targeting a general audience. The existing channels with mostly
pop music content will be merged and produced in Baden-Baden alone.

<P>
The heads of SWF and SDR, Mr Voss and Mr Fuenfgeld, welcomed the agreement
of the State Premiers. They, however, stated that they would check whether
the treaty assures a "guarantee for development" of the new station in the
sense of the Freedom of Broadcasting Act.
