No sign of Thomy blackmailers or poisoned Thomy products
</H1>
Frankfurt am Main. There has been no sign of the blackmailers of the
food manufacturing company Thomy, and the Frankfurt police have
received no further demands from them. Last night, more than 60,000
people rang the special telephone line which has been set up for
inquiries. In their original communication, the blackmailers claimed
to have placed poisoned products in over 50 supermarkets throughout
the whole of Germany. Nestle has replaced all its products but none
yet investigated showed any sign of anything unusual. The police have
announced that it could take up to two days before all the goods have
been investigated and have called on people to return all Thomy and
Nestle products unopened to the shops where they bought them. Nestle
has been being blackmailed for over a year, and poison has been found
in its products several times.

New worm in fish scare
</H1>
According to 'Monitor,' a programme on the ARD television network,
fresh fish is often infested with nematodes, a type of threadworm;
almost all sea fish can carry the larvae. These parasites enter the
fish though their foodstuffs and mostly inhabit the gastro-intestinal
tract, but they sometimes settle into the fish's muscles. If infested
fish are not cooked properly, the nematodes can survive the cooking
process and present a health hazard to the consumer. There are two
species of worm which are especially dangerous for humans, the herring
worm and the cod worm, and research commissioned for the 'Monitor'
programme has shown that both types of worm are very common in fish.
There were reports of worm larvae infestation in fish just ten years
ago, and Germany the European Union issued new guidelines on the
preparation of fish and tightened regulations on inspection as a
result.

Stolpe demands more money for flood victims
</H1>
Manfred Stolpe, the Prime Minister of Brandenburg, has called
for more help to be given to the victims of the recent flooding in the
region around the Oder river. In a government statement, Stolpe said
that, although the total cost of the damage is not yet certain, it is
already clear that the costs cannot be covered by the state of
Brandenburg and the donations which have been given up till now. It is
thus important, Stolpe continued, that Chancellor Kohl should declare
the help needed to cope with the flooding to be a national duty.

Brandenburg state parliament agrees 'Oder-programme'
</H1>
Brandenburg's state parliament has agreed unanimously on a
special 'Oder-programme' to help those affected by the recent
flooding. According to a first estimate, 170 houses and 177,000
hectares of agricultural land were flooded and 950 firms were damaged.
The exact extent of the damages is not yet calculable, but it is
certain to exceed the hundreds of millions which have already been
promised by the national government and the European Union. The state
cabinet in Potsdam is hoping to organise immediate help and
reconstruction justly and quickly and with a minimum of bureaucracy.
An account set up by the state for donations has already received DM
12 million. Prime Minister Stolpe has promised those affected that
they will receive special help in the next few weeks.

Bundesbank pessimistic about tax revenues
</H1>
The Bundesbank (German National Bank) has predicted that
national, state and regional government will receive even less tax
revenues than in previous years. The bank, based in Frankfurt, expects
tax income to be worse than the pessimistic predictions made in May,
when it was thought that public finances would be DM 18 billion short.
The Bundesbank also expects tax revenue to fall in the next three
years and has recommended that taxation be reformed so that income tax
is substantially reduced and taxes on consumption are increased. The
tax reform should be transparent and should plug tax loopholes. The
Federal Ministry of Finance, however, is planning to keep to the
figures it set out in May. The SPD, meanwhile, has repeated its
criticism of the governments plans for the tax reform, which would not
be affordable under these circumstances.

Rise in unemployment is 'endangering pension system'
</H1>
according to pension insurance companies, the chief danger
for the pension system is the constant increase in unemployment.
Ruhland, the president of the organisation of insurers, has emphasised
the fact that the low employment ratio is endangering the pension
system, alongside the increase in average age of the population. In
connection with this, Ruhland criticised employers who have caused the
pension companies to pay out an additional DM 20 billion each year
because there have been so many early retirements. Ruhland has called
for the pension reform to be brought forward to 1998 as this will take
the pressure of the pension companies and will remove the danger that
pensioners will suffer from having no yearly increase in their
pensions.

</H1>

Illegally low pay rates are common on German building sites
</H1>
According to the trade union Bauen, Agrar, Umwelt
('Construction, Agriculture, Environment'), at most fifteen per cent
of the foreign construction workers employed on German building sites
are paid the minimum wage. Wieshuegel, the president of the union
IG-Bau, said in an interview with the newspaper 'Neue Osnabruecker
Zeitung' that there are virtually no big building sites in Germany
where there is absolutely no form of illegal work going on, so it
wouldn't surprise him if illegally low pay rates were being paid on
construction projects financed by the government. Wiesehuegel called
for harder punishments for those responsible.
