Another dike breached in Brandenburg
</H1>
Another dike broke at the Oder river, south of Frankfurt.  Near the Zilkendorf
depression, the completely soaked dike gave way under the pressure of the
floodwater and ruptured over a distance of 20 meters.  The town of Orit and
the Thaelmann settlement were flooded.  According to the Interior Ministry of
Brandenburg, between the towns of Brieskow-Finkenherd and Vogelsang, the dike
is so brittle that it had to be given up.  The Bundeswehr has deployed several
thousand men in the area and has begun building an emergency dike in the
interior.  The crisis command center expects another surge of water tonight.

<P>
The United Nations have announced to provide aid to the victims of the
flooding in Europe.  As was said in New York, the department for humanitarian
issues will set up a special bank account in Geneva into which the governments
of UN member countries can pay contributions to eliminate the flood damage.
The Government of Poland had asked the United Nations for help.  Devastations
through the flooding have been worst in Poland and the Czech Republic.

</H1>
Federal President Herzog has called for deepening the relations between
Germany and the U.S. in view of the challenges posed by the 21st century.  In
his speech at Georgetown University in Washington D.C. he recalled that the
trans-atlantic community is marked in particular by its common values of
freedom, democracy, peace and market economy.  It is crucial that finding
peaceful solutions for new threats be the foremost interest of both countries,
Mr. Herzog said.  This fundamental agreement gives the lie to all everyday
disputes.  Later Mr. Herzog met with President Clinton in the White House.
