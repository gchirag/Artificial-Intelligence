Former head of East German spy agency Wolf in court
</H1>
The former head of the East German spy agency, Markus Wolf, =
is
back in court. He is accused of having encouraged kidnappings. Since his
conviction for treason was reversed in 1993, federal prosecutors are now
trying to bring Wolf behind bars for bodily injury, unlawful detention an=
d
coercion. In this new trial before the Duesseldorf Higher Regional Court,
Wolf is charged with participating in the violent capture of an escaped
member of the former East German secret police in 1962.  He is also accus=
ed
of having a secretary transported from an American agency in West Berlin =
to
East Germany 7 years earlier.
The Federal High Court lifted Wolf=92s the 6-year prison sentence for tre=
ason
in 1995 due to a decision by the Constitution Court in which agents who h=
ad
operated in East Germany could not be tried in West German criminal court=
s
for spying.  Since the statute of limitations for these crimes has run ou=
t
according to West German law, federal prosecutors are referring to East
German law.
Wolf attacked the federal prosecutors, claiming that his actions were nor=
mal
for the secret police.  He did not disobey his country=92s constitution o=
r
laws.

</H1>
 According to Mr. Rexrodt, Minister of Economics, it is much too ha=

to fire employees in Germany.  In a newspaper interview, Rexrodt stated t=

the mandatory long notices of termination are responsible for the many ho=
urs
of overtime. If employment law does not become more flexible, companies w=
ill
not be interested in hiring additional workers to reduce overtime.
Umbrella wage agreements, according to Rexrodt, poison the economy and jo=
bs.
Companies are limited as to what wages they can pay.
Rexrodt=92s statements were criticized by the CDU/CSU employee groups in =

German Federation of Unions expects unemployment to rise in 1997
</H1>
The German Federation of Unions expects unemployment figures to rea=
ch
4.6 mil in January and February. The vice chairman of the federation, Mr.
Engelen-Kefer, reported today that the December figures reached record
levels, with 4.1 mil. Without a more aggressive employment policy, the an=
nual
average will exceed this number as well. Engelen-Kefer requested once mor=
e
that overtime be reduced and more part-time positions for older workers b=
e
created. Personnel reductions must be stopped.
Overall, the EU and German government=92s policy to stabilize currency va=
lues
is having a stifling effect on the economy.  The German Institute for
Economic Research, as well as the German Federation of Unions, predicts t=
hat
unemployment figures will rise dramatically.
The Institute, based in Berlin, does not believe that the goal to cut the
number of unemployed persons in half by 2000, as the German government ho=
pes,
will be achieved.

Economists do not believe that the economic upswing expected by t=

Economic Research expect the economy to grow by 2 percent, which is much =

little. Two percent growth will not create enough jobs or meet the challe=

posed by reunification. Unemployment will rise in the East as Well as the
west, reaching a peak of 4.5 mil. The West, however, will profit slightly
from positive foreign economic trends and a devalued Mark.
