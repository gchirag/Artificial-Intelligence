Herzog: Germany Has to Develop a Service Culture
</H1>
 Federal President Herzog has called for the Germans to develop a service
culture.  The German people would have to learn to adjust to the wishes of
customers and consumers.  If this were the case, the little employment miracle
which occurred between 1984 and 1994 could recur.  During that time, the
service economy created more than three million new jobs in the old federal
states.  At the same time, Mr. Herzog calls for more courage to become
independent on the part of the young people who are in vocational training.
This would constitute a possible road out of unemployment which would
simultaneously create new jobs.  Herzog asked all Germans to react to the
challenges of the time with optimism, the readiness to take chances and
mobility.

a return to SED [Socialist Unity Party of the German Democratic Republic]
ideology was out of the question.  She stated that unemployment depressed many
people in the new federal states and was making them receptive to the promises
of the PDS.  The strengthening of the party which succeeded the SED would
be create problems for growing together and solidarity of support, according to
Ms. Suessmuth.

"Green Dot"- Waste: Sorting Dangerous?
</H1>
 According to a report in the Hamburg news magazine, DER SPIEGEL, the
sorting sites for packing material waste with the "Green Dot" are the most
dangerous places of employment in Germany.  Because half full yoghurt
containers, salmon wrappers, or liverwurst cans are rotting away, the air
breathed in is extremely full of mildew and other bacteria.  The magazine
refers to an unpublished study of the Federal Institute for the Protection of
Workers and Workers' Medicine which is located in Berlin.  At the request of
the Labor Ministry in Bonn, the agency will now examine blood samples from
approximately 400 waste workers to ascertain whether their health has been
affected.

which had formerly prevailed was no longer being satisfied in the present
situation of change.  But, he added, it was important for western Germany to
accept this eastern German need for social security.
