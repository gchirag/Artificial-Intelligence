Schaeuble also found in donations quagmire
</H1>
CDU president Wolfgang Schaeuble has defended his actions in the party
donations affaire. At a press conference in Berlin, Schaeuble said he
did not feel responsible in any way. Everything was as it should when
he accepted the 100'000-DM-donation of Bavarian arms dealer Karl-Heinz
Schreiber. Schaeuble had given the money to CDU treasurer Baumeister.
Schaeuble assured that he had not received any donations of the same
dimension.
<P>
Meanwhile, Ms. Baumeister has accepted accountability for illegally
booking the donation as "various revenue" instead of "donation".
<P>
Schaeuble has also come under pressure from his own party today.
Several leaders at the CDU state level called his behaviour
disappointing. They accused Scaeuble of informing the party and the
public much too late. The leaders of the CDU in North Rhine-Westphalia
and Rhineland-Palatinate, Juergen Ruettgers and Christoph Boehr,
however, called Schaeuble's behaviour "correct".
<P>
Meanwhile, arms dealer Schreiber who is living in Canada has stated the
actual purpose of his 100'000-DM-donation for the first time. Schreiber
told the daily "Die Welt" he wanted to encourage the construction of a
Thyssen factory for light tank vehicles in Canada. In his political
contacts with CDU but also SPD he was lobbying for the project.

5.5 per-cent: metal union back in battle mood
</H1>
Difficult collective bargaining is expected for the metal and
electrical industry. The union IG Metall is demanding pay rises of 5.5
percent. Werner Stumpfe, the president of Gesamtmetall representing the
employers said the union wanted to take more from the pot than it
contained. It was agreed in the Alliance for Labour that wage contracts
would be aimed at the average production growth of the total economy.
This, however, was put by experts at 2.6 percent.

<P>
The CEO of the Federal Alliance of German Employers Associations Mr.
Goehner (sp?) warned IG Metall against disrupt the Alliance for Labour.

Building Minister Heye: empty flats no problem specific to pre-fabs
</H1>
Saxony-Anhalt's Building Minister Juergen Heyer has warned to turn the
discussion on empty apartments against street blocks dominated by
buildings consisting of pre-fabricated parts. Empty partments were
no problem specific to pre fabs, said Heyer today in Magdeburg. At the
awards ceremony for exemplary renovations of pre-fab blocks the
minister stated that empty flats were always a problem of places with
low availability of quality housing. This could happen in historic city
centres as well as in unrenovated building from the end of the 19th
century or post-war years. Another important cause for empty flats was
the population decrease of Saxony-Anhalt and the other East-German states.

French trucking strike: 70 border crossings blocked
</H1>
French transport companies have tightened their border blockades today.
Freight traffic in Switzerland, to Germany, Spain, Belgium and Italy has
been brought to a standstill at 70 border crossings. Foreign

often also when leaving. On the French-German border alone fifteen
crossing points have been blocked. Private cars, however, are so far
still being let through.
<P>
The transport  companies are protesting against the introduction of the
35-hour work week. They fear competition disadvantages with respect to
their European counterparts, whose drivers work longer hours.

PDS: collaboration between Mecklenburg and Saxony-Anhalt
</H1>
The PDS-state parliament factions from Saxony-Anhalt and
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern want to collaborate more closely. After a round
of talks in Schwerin it appears that in both states policies on the
labour market and economy, as well as on budgetary issues and finance,
are comparable. Joint actions are also possible on the state parliament
level. As faction leader Sitte for the PDS from Saxony-Anhalt
emphasized, they plan to follow the example of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern
where, since the fall of 1998, they have had the first Red-Red coalition
in Germany. In two years time there will be state parliamentary
elections in Saxony-Anhalt. Then the PDS must ask itself again whether
it will consider joint government with the SPD.
