Conflict in CDU/CSU regarding successor for Kohl
</H1>
There is conflict within the ranks of the CDU/CSU regarding who should be
chosen as a successor to Helmut Kohl. Mr. Oettinger, the deputy
parliamentary leader of the CSU, said to the "Deutschlandfunk" radio
station that reservations voiced by the CSU regarding choosing Wolfgang
Schaeuble, the parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag, were
not called for and harmed the party's chances of winning the elections.
He said that the CSU's  policies were perhaps good for their image, but
harmful to their sister party, the CDU. He continued that no-one doubted
that after Mr. Kohl, Mr. Schaeuble had the most authority in the Union.
Mr. Friedrich, the deputy leader of the CSU, has also said in a newspaper
interview that his party would make a significant contribution in
choosing a successor for Mr. Kohl and that the CSU also had suitable
people for being chosen as the party's candidate for Chancellor.

CDU and SPD politicians support speculation tax
</H1>
Politicians of both the SPD and the CDU are supporting introducing a tax
on profits from shares. Mr. Dressler, the SPD expert on welfare
matters, said that it was unjust that those who were ill had to pay
increased contributions towards the cost of the medicine while others did
not have to pay taxes on the millions of marks of profit made from
speculating in shares. A newspaper article in the "Bild am Sonntag"
reported that Mr. Dressler is calling for a taxation of profits made
both from speculating and in industry.

<P>
Geissler, the deputy parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, has
supported the introduction of an international speculation tax, as, he
said, the heated share markets were not healthy for the capitalist
system. Mr. Geissler is a supporter of introducing international
regulations for controlling financial markets according to a policy of
socially responsible market systems.
