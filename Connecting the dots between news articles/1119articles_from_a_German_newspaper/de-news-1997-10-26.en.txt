games or open-air concerts.  He continued that those who call the police
after petty accidents which involve no casualties should have to pay a fee.

Remuneration of AOK board members to be cut drastically
</H1>

Hamburg.  The Ministers of Welfare for Bavaria and Saxony plan to make cuts
to the remuneration of members of the boards of community health insurance
schemes.  According to a newspaper report, a decrease of about 200 000
marks per year was mentioned.  Mrs. Stamm, the Bavarian Minister of
Welfare, explained that allowing state health insurance management to
regulate the remuneration themselves has been proven to be ineffective.
Saxony's Minister of Welfare, Mr. Geissler, said the remuneration of board
members was totally unreasonable. According to the newspaper, chairmen of
AOK boards (state public health insurance scheme) earn an average 300 000
marks per annum. In Bavaria and Baden Wuerttemberg they earned up to 400
000 marks per annum.  Two years ago, chairmen of AOK boards in Bavaria only
earned about half that amount.  The health insurance schemes had justified
these increases by saying that it was in accordance with free competition
among insurance companies.
