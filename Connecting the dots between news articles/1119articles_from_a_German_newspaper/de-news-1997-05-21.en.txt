Support plan for Eastern Germany passed
</H1>
The federal cabinet today agreed to a new plan to support the
economic development of Eastern Germany. Economic Minister Rexrodt
explained that despite the current budgetary situation, development monies
would be maintained at present levels after 1999. Special tax deductions
would be abolished in the future, according to the plan, but investment
payments would double. The plan provides for approximately DM 5.7 billion
a year in development funds.
After 1998, federal support monies are to be concentrated in areas where
jobs could be created, namely in heavy industry and the service branch.

SPD wants to make Germany a high-tech country
</H1>
The leadership of the SPD has announced at the Innovation
Convention that it would double spending on research, education, and
science within 5 years if the SPD formed the next federal government.
Party leader Lafontaine criticized the current government for a lack of
readiness to modernize, saying that conservatives viewed increasing
globalization in the marketplace as a threat, and used the fear of that
threat to implement faulty economic thinking and wealth redistribution
policies detrimental to the vast majority of the population. Lafontaine
said that globalization should be an opportunity for Germany, something
which must be understood as an opportunity to cooperate with others, and
that the SPD wanted to use that opportunity to increase prosperity and to
create new, secure jobs.
Lower Saxony's Premier Schroeder demanded that the basic wage contracts be
reformed: "The employees' representation on the factory committees must
have more chance to act on the peculiarities of their companies; working
with the unions, we will fight for this measure of flexibility and
implement it together."

Partial victory for opponents of nuclear storage facility
</H1>
The first battle in the war over the permanent nuclear storage
facility in Morsleben, Saxony-Anhalt, has been won by opponents to the
station. The Federal Administrative Court has ruled that the Higher
Administrative Court in Magdeburg must look into the threat to their
health that the plaintiffs fear. With the ruling, the federal judges
annulled an earlier ruling from Magdeburg.
The facility was put into operation by the socialist government of
then-East Germany. The federal government would like it to continue
accepting nuclear waste until probably 2003, possibly even 2005.

</H1>
The judgement against former East German border guard commander
Baumgarten and 5 others generals is legally valid. The Supreme Court has

attempted manslaughter of East German refugees. The other generals
received sentences of between 39 and 45 months as accessories. According
to the Region Court, they had helped in working out Baumgarten's orders to
use firearms to prevent unauthorized border crossings.

Subsidies for Magdeburg mechanical engineering company illegal
</H1>
Brussels, Belgium. The European Commission has declared German subsidies
to the SKETT mechanical engineering company in Magdeburg to be illegal. A
spokesman for the Commission said that the DM 600 million given to the
company, which has since gone bankrupt, must be paid back to the German
authorities. It is unclear, however, whether this demand can actually be
satisfied, given the bankruptcy.
On the other hand, the European Commission has approved approximately DM
500 million in subsidies for the shipyards of the former Vulkan group. A
spokesman for the Commission said that that subsidy was in line with EU
regulations.
