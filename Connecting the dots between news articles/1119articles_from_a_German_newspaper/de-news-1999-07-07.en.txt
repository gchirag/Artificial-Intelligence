EU ambassadors condemn Bangemann's abrupt departure to Telefonica
</H1>
The ambassadors of the European Union have condemned the actions of EU
Commissioner Bangemann, who is on a leave of absence. They criticized his
behavior in taking a job with the Spanish telephone company Telefonica as
ethically objectionable. Based on an initial legal examination however, a
complaint against the FDP politician in the European Court would seem to
have little chance of success. The EU ambassadors intend to continue their
consultations tomorrow. Bangemann has been criticized for taking a job in
an industry which he was until quite recently in charge of regulating. If
a complaint is filed, the aim would be to revoke his EU pension. The
German government, according to remarks by government spokesperson Heye,
would cooperate in pursuing a European Court trial. FDP party leader
Gerhardt said nobody in his party has any understanding or sympathy for
Bangemann's behavior.

Government postpones atomic energy talks until September
</H1>
The federal government apparently sees no possibility for a rapid
settlement of the controversy surrounding the abandonment of nuclear power
generation. A high level meeting of the federal government coalition
partners, the SPD and the Greens, was called off on short notice.
Government spokesperson Heye explained that a working group at the
undersecretary level now has until September 30th to come up with a
solution for a compensation free exit strategy. The Ministry for the
Environment will take the leadership role. Ministers Trittin (Environment)
and Mueller (Economy) have publicly contested the timetable for the
abandonment of atomic energy. Trittin insists that some atomic power
plants must be taken off line prior to the next federal elections in 2002.
