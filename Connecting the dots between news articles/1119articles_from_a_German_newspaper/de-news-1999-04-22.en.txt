No tax increases from Kosovo deployment
</H1>
The deployment of German armed forces in Kosovo will not lead to an
additional burden on the budget, in the opinion of the coalition government
in Bonn. The 440 million DM of additional funds earmarked in the defense
budget were sufficient said Metzger, finance spokesperson for the Greens, at
the final deliberations of the budget committee. There would be neither
higher taxes nor an increase in new debt.
<P>
The committee decided to allocate 300 million DM for humanitarian aid in
Kosovo. It is also deliberating cuts of more than 2 billion DM in this year's
budget.

Executive declaraion on 50th anniversary of NATO
</H1>
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the founding of NATO,
politicians from both the coalition and the opposition honored the alliance
today in the Bundestag. Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder described the
alliance as indispensable for securing peace and freedom. Chancellor
Schroeder and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer called on their European NATO
partners to take on more responsibility within the alliance. Defense Minister
Rudolf Scharping praised NATO as an essential pillar of peace and security.
Former Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said that if Europeans took over more
responsibility in the future, they could still count on the support of the
United States. NATO's accomplishments should not be diminished by the crisis
in Kosovo. Ruehe supported the government's position in the conflict.
<P>
Schroeder again justified NATO's attacks on Yugoslavian targets. Particularly
Germans with their history had the duty to step in against oppression,
expulsion and violence. He called on Russia to rejoin talks with NATO and to
play a role in a peace plan in Kosovo. Foreign Minister Fischer said that
there would be no political solution of the Kosovo conflict without Russia.

Fewer alcohol-related auto accidents
</H1>
The number of alcohol-related accidents decreased markedly last
year. The Federal Department of Statistics announced that in 1998 there were
more than 71,000 accidents in which at least one of the people involved was
under the influence of alcohol. This was 13 percent less than in 1997. The
statisticians attributed the decrease primarily to the lowered blood alcohol
limit. Overall, alcohol is a factor in one of every seven traffic deaths.

Bundestag Speaker Thierse says pay increase modest
</H1>
Parliamentary Speaker Wolfgang Thierse described the planned
incremental increases in the salaries of Members of Parliament as modest.
Thierse referred to a 1995 law according to which the salary of MPs should
follow that of federal judges. Currently, the salary of an MP is 1,600 DM
less than that of a judge. For this reason, he suggested to the parliamentary
parties that their pay should increase by 350 DM in four stages beginning in
January of next year. By 2003, the annual salary of an MP would be 14,275 DM.

The German and Italian telecommunications companies Telekom and

capital, however. 56 percent of the joint holding is owned by Telekom
shareholders. Stockholders of both companies as well as regulatory agencies
have yet to approve the merger deal.

</H1>
Employers and the construction industry union (IG Bau) have agreed
that close to 800,000 employees of the construction industry in the Western
states should receive a wage increase of 2.9 percent retroactive to April 1.

cut from 77 to 55 percent of a month's salary. Construction Union President
Klaus Wiesenhuegel spoke of a justifiable compromise. According to the
agreement, the increase in real wages amounts to 1.6 percent. The lead
negotiator for the employers, Thomas Bauer, called the result supportable,
though not totally satisfactory for the employers.
