additional money is to be transferred only after things in Albania
return to a normal state.

Expulsion of Bosnian refugees slower than planned
</H1>
The Federal States no longer consider it realistic to stick to
the schedule for the expulsion of Bosnian refugees. Berlin's Senator of
the Interior Schoenbohm said that only about one third of the more
than 300,000 Bosnian refugees will leave Germany this year. This
figure includes people returning voluntarily and citizens of Bosnia and
Herzegovina who are to be expelled. Originally all Bosnian refugees
were scheduled to leave Germany this year.

Bosnia there are not enough accomodations for 100,000 refugees.

Senator of the Interior Schoenbohm announced that Berlin wants to
increase the number of expulsions of Bosnian war refugees after
Easter. In Berlin the CDU politician said the rate of forced
expolsions would be increased over the next few weeks but that the
Senat intended to coordinate its measures with the other state
governments.

going to expel some refugees to Sarajevo before Easter. Within one

New States. Representatives of CDU/CSU and FDP declared in Berlin that
the economy in the eastern part of Germany must be supported even after
the end of the current programs in 1998. Minister of Economics Rexrodt,
however, suggested a change in supporting measures. Instead of allowing
special deductions, direct investment aids should be grantd. The SPD
expert for the New States' economy, Mueller, criticized Rexrodt's
proposal, saying that in the past changes had unsually been accompanied
by cuts. CDU parliamentary party leader Schaeuble, however, affirmed
that the current volume of financial support would be preserved.

States criticize Waigel's tax plan
</H1>
The Social Democrats estimate that the tax plan presented by Federal
Minister of Finances Waigel has no chance of being realized. None of
the 16 states, whether governed by Social Democrats or by the Union,
would be willing to accept income losses of 21 billion marks, SPD
financial coordinator and Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau said after
the meeting of the party's executive board in Bonn.

<P>
According to the 'Berliner Tagesspiegel', the governing coalition and
the SPD plan to begin new talks about the tax reform before Easter. SPD
