</H1>

in the final analysis, said today to the news agency ADN. Wittenberg was

Iran enraged after indictment in the Mykonos trial
</H1>
After the accusations of the federal prosecutor in the Mykonos
trial, both the press and government took a harder tone against Bonn.
Parliament president Nadek-Nuri (sp?) accused Germany with supplying the
chemical arms used by Iraq in their 1987 attack against their Kurdish
population. Up to this point Iran had kept this fact secret, in order not
to damage their good relations with Germany.
<P>
The German embassy in Teheran was counting on further protest
announcements from radical Islamic elements against the Mykonos trial.
The radical Islamic group Ansa Hezbollah has already announced a new
protest in front of the embassy for next week. The press in Teheran is
demanding from its government the cessation of diplomatic relations with
Germany. 
<P>
At the same time the Buendnis90/The Greens coalition is calling
for the federal government to apply pressure to the Iranian regime to
enforce human rights. The coalition's speaker for human rights issues,
Amke Dieter-Scheuer (sp?), said today on "Inforadio", that it was
important to see that federal government take not only an economic
interest in Iran, but that Iran has great interest in economic ties to
the outside world and to get its political foot in the door as well. The
Iranians therefore have a very clear self-interest, which must be utilized
by placing very explicit demands, even in human rights matters. Whether
met in economic or in human rights situations such linkage must occur, she
said.
