Possibility for talks concerning dual citizenship?
</H1>
In the debate on dual citizenship, the unyielding fronts appear to
show some flexibility. Leading representatives from the government and
the CDU announced the possibility for talks. SPD leader Lafontaine
said the goal is to europeanize the German Nationality Law and to
adopt the practice of other countries. The CDU/CSU is talking about
giving young foreigners up to a certain age the guarranty for
naturalization if they give up their existing citizenship.  The big
churches renewed their criticism of the intended campaign by the
CDU/CSU against dual citizenship. The Council President of the
Protestant Church in Germany, Kock, and the President of the German
Caritas Association, Puschmann, expressed the fear that anti-foreigner
groups could affiliate themselves with the campaign and be
strengthened through it.

Waigel criticizes course of action by the CSU
</H1>
The outgoing CSU President, Waigel, criticized the course of action of
his party in the debate on dual citizenship. Waigel deplored in an
interview that the CDU/CSU had discussed the substance too little.
Waigel said with reference to his successor that Edmund Stoiber should
work on integration.  Letting it rumble first when dealing with the
CDU in order to wait and see what the CDU would say, is not a
functioning method. At the same time, Waigel distanced himself from
State Chancellor Huber who had threatened those states in which the
PDS was a governing party with the withdrawal of financial support.
Waigel said: "The contract basis is clear, the solidarity pact is
solid."

First details of the planned new nationality law
</H1>
Foreigners living in Germany can only be naturalized in the future
under certain conditions, according to a draft of the new nationality
law by the Minister of the Interior, Schily, part of which was made
public today.  Based on the draft, those who want to become a citizen
German will have to reside legally in Germany for only eight years
instead of 15 years.  Children under the age of 18 who lived in
Germany with one of their parents may apply for naturalization after
five years. Children born in Germany who have foreign parents may also
obtain German citizenship in addition to their parents' citizenship if
one of their parents was born in Germany or immigrated to Germany as a
minor under the age of 14. A foreigner with a long criminal record
will, however, not be entitled to naturalization. In addition, the
applicant must possess sufficient German language skills and live
without social and unemployment aid. The bill includes a safety clause
which requires a clear declaration for the German constitution from
the applicant. But there will be no rule inquiry at the German
Domestic Intelligence Agency. Details of the bill will be announced by
Schily tomorrow.

CDU considers Islamic education in schools in its "integration concept"
</H1>
Several CDU politicians want to introduce teaching Islamic religion in
German schools, according to a written draft for the controversial
collection of signatures to be started on January 24. According to the
so-called "integration concept," Islamic education must fall under the
state's supervision of schools. Islamic education will be held in
German, and the teachers will be educated at German universities. It
is natural and desired that muslims maintain, profess, and practice
their faith in Germany. This would allow for a contribution to
tolerance and openness.  The wording was met with rejection by other
CDU politicians. The state premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Teufel,
doubts whether Islamic education could leave the constitutional base.

Coalition agrees on new regulations for 630 Mark jobs
</H1>
SPD and Greens agreed on new regulations of the 630 Mark jobs,
according to which activities of this type will in essence remain
tax-free, unless they are performed in addition to another job. In the
future, employers must pay a contribution in the amount of ten percent
to the legal health insurance instead of a flat tax, and a
contribution in the amount of twelve percent to the social security
insurance fund. But the employee will only be entitled to social
security if he pays an additional 7.5 from his income to the legal age
provision fund. Those earning less than 300 Mark per month will also
have to pay the employer contribution up to this limit if he wanted to
be entitled to a pension.

Fischer speaks before European Parliament
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Fischer reminded of an extensive reform of the
European Union. Fischer said before the European parliament in Strassbourg, the successful introduction of the Euro must now be followed by
a strengthening of the political functioning of the EU. The German
foreign minister confirmed the desire of the federal government to
expand the Union through countries of middle and eastern Europe. This
requires the successful conclusion of the negotiations about the reform
package "Agenda 2000" by the time of the EU summit in Brussels in March.

<P>
Fischer warned if no agreement can be reached by that time, the Union
would seriously question the expansions.
In addition, the federal government intended to achieve significant
progress in employment politics by passing a European employment
package.

Federal Railway Office says broken wheel sole cause of ICE crash
</H1>
The Federal Railway Office holds that a broken steel tire was the sole
cause of the Eschede ICE disaster. The office disagrees with an expert
opinion that stated a defective switch might have contributed towards
the accident. According to the office, the switch was damaged by the
broken tire to the point of switching its position, causing the
derailment which hurled one of the coaches against a bridge abutment.
The collapsing bridge buried several coaches, causing the majority of
the 101 fatalities.

Stuttgart's police chief transferred to a desk in interior ministry
</H1>
Stuttgart's police chief Haas is being transferred to the ministry of
the interior. Baden-Wuerttemberg's interior minister Schaeuble said
there was an unsurmountable incompatibility between Haas and
Stuttgart's mayor Schuster.  The underlying cause is a clash between
Schuster and Haas over the Kurdish epiphany day demonstration. Haas
had favored letting PKK sympathizers view the remains of a party
functionary. Schuster had disagreed and accused Haas of reviving an
evil Nazi tradition, whereupon Haas lodged a complaint against him,
making him eat his words. SPD and the Green party voiced heavy
criticism of the transfer and said it just came to cold-shouldering an
able police chief for reasons of party policy.
