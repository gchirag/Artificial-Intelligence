Few leads after church burning
</H1>
The police have received 20 tips following the arson attack on a
Catholic church in Luebeck but there still is no main lead. The public
prosecutor's office stated that it was therefore unlikely that the case
would be solved quickly. The special task force was doubled to 40 officers
and is working as fast as possible. In addition to interviews with the
public there would be investigations of the right-wing extremist scene. The
Protestant bishop of Luebeck, Pohlwage (sp?), called for a ban of all
right-wing extremist parties. He condemned the church burning as an attack
on democracy, saying the perpetrators' message was to stay out of
everything and not work actively for the rights of foreigners.  The fire
was started Sunday in an annex of St. Vicelin Catholic Church in Luebeck.
It destroyed most of the church. On a wall, the perpetrators had scribbled
swastikas and the name of a Protestant preacher whose church is granting
church asylum to an Algerian family.

SPD introduces tax plan
</H1>
The SPD today presented the party's tax plan which is designed to
create more jobs and a fair tax system. SPD leader Lafontaine declared that
the tax reform should be yield neutral ("aufkommensneutral") for citizens,
businesses, and the state, and that the goal was to give the average
two-children family a tax break of 2,500 marks per year. Details include a
lowering of the entry tax level from currently 25.8 to 22 and then to 15
percent. The tax-free subsistence level should be raised by 2,000 marks to
14,000 marks per year and child benefits should go up 30 marks to 250
marks. Contributions to social security should be lowered by 2 percent.
Reinvested business profits should be taxed at 35 percent corporate tax
instead of the current 47 percent. There is no proposal for a new maximum
tax on private incomes. The SPD agrees to a decrease if is offset with a
cut of additional subsidies. The plan should be financed through raising
the VAT by one percent and the mineral oil tax by six pfennigs. In
addition, the property tax should be reintroduced and 40 bio. marks worth
of tax subsidies cut.

Reactions to tax plan
</H1>
Coalition representatives presented different reactions to the SPD
tax plan. The CDU stated that a common ground for new talks with the Social
Democrats had become apparent. The head of the CDu parliamentary group,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, detected absurdities in the plan, saying that he did
not consider the financing proposals realistic. He said that he would be
available for talks at any time in order to improve chances for an
"objectively oriented result." The CSU, however, criticized the SPD plan as
a clumsy package for tax hikes and redistribution. The FDP parliamentary
group's leader Solms also expressed his opinion that the SPD plan was not
thought through and that additional rounds of talks would therefore not
make sense.

Coalition argues about budget policies
</H1>
After the FDP part convention, the coalition debates on budget
policies intensified. While the FDP insisted on its rejection of tax
raises, finance minister Waigel did not dismiss new tax hikes in the light
of the difficult financial situation. The CDU secretary general Hintze even
questioned the lowering of the solidarity tax which had already been agreed
on, but Waigel wants to adhere to it. According to Hintze, the Liberals
generally acted coalition compatible at their convention. Chancellor Kohl
reminded the Liberals of existing coalition arrangements and warned them of
"conjuration formulas".

Lafontaine threatens with rejection of "Maastricht II" treaty
</H1>
At the Social-Democratic European Convention German SPD leader Oskar
Lafontaine said his party would endorse the Maastricht II treaty only when
it contains suggestions for an active employment policy. The task to fight
mass unemployment must take first place. At the same time Lafontaine
advocated a gradual harmonization of tax rates within the European Union.
Without it, the European economic and monetary union would be built on
shaky ground.

rejected a demand by National Federation of Unions (DGB) for a shorter and
more practice-oriented professional education for youths. On
Deutschland-radio Berlin Wunder said job training indeed had to be improved
in many points but youths should no longer be trained for particular jobs
but should attain a high level of quality. Young people could no longer
expect to be in the same profession for life.
