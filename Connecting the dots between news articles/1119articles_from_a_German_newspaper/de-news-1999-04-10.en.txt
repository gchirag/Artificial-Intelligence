Inclement weather hinders air strikes
</H1>
Inclement weather has again severely hindered NATO combat aircraft in
Yugoslavia from bombing the planned targets.  According to a NATO official
in Brussels, a large number of missions were either interrupted or not
implemented at all.  He also noted that combat aircraft had destroyed a
radio station in Pristina. The stations were part of a military
communications system, which was the actual target. He added that cruise
missiles had been used to eliminate fuel depots and factories. In the
afternoon in Belgrade, air raid alarms sounded again after a brief
all-clear.

Fischer: NATO air strikes to continue
</H1>
According to Federal Foreign Minister Fischer, the air strikes against
Yugoslavia will continue. The attacks will continue until every citizen in
Kosovo is assured a peaceful and secure existence, he added.  At the same
time, Mr. Verheugen, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, stated
that the federal government will continue to pursue its original policy
and no ground troops will be sent into Kosovo.

<P>
In Bonn, there is increasing support for the introduction of NATO ground
troops. However, the opposition as well as the vast majority of government
officials is decidedly against the use of ground troops. In an interview
with "Der Spiegel," Chancellor Schroeder attempted to put his critics in
their place.  He said that there was a moral imperative to uphold what is
right and to reach the goals that have been set.  He stressed that
pacifism was not an answer to genocide. However, he does not wish to be
known as a chancellor of war.

NATO positive about military operations
</H1>
A NATO spokesman in Brussels called the air strikes a success. He stated
that the bombings had done a great deal of damage to Yugoslavia. Since the
military operations began, more than 150 large targets have been hit and
damaged. However, NATO should not yet discontinue the air strikes, he
said. The general feeling in Brussels is that only President Milosevich
can put an end to this process.  The state of the ethnic Albanians
isolated in Kosovo remains unclear. Reports that twenty women had been
carried off and murdered could not be confirmed by NATO. This was also
true of a report that a large number of women had been raped by Serbian
troops. The NATO spokesman was only able to verify that the refugees which
cross the borders daily had said they had witnessed such atrocities.

Wiczorek-Zeul in Albania
</H1>
The Federal Minister of Development, Heidemarie Wiczorek-Zeul, flew to
Albania today to learn about the fate of Kosovo refugees. She wanted to
visit the area to gain perspective on German and international emergency
measures.  The emergency organizations in Bonn are focusing on supporting
the countries adjacent to Kosovo in their efforts to take in refugees. The
vice prime minister of Albania thanked Ms. Wiczorek-Zeul for the financial
assistance from Germany. 35 million marks have been earmarked as emergency
aid, with an additional 35 million marks offered by the minister today.
Wiczorek-Zeul is well aware, however, that such a sum is not nearly enough
to get one of the largest refugee crises since World War II under control.
The minister emphasized that private funding campaigns and donations would
also be needed. The Albanian vice prime minister seconded her view.
