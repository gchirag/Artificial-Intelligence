CDU can't agree on what to do about Mr Kohl
</H1>
The CDU party's leadership can't agree on what to do with or against
former
Chancellor Kohl. Head of the party Schaeuble hinted at legal action,
General
Secretary Merkel, however, would have nothing of it. There would have to
be
other ways and means to coax donors' names out of the former head of the
party. Mr Schaeuble and Lower Saxony's Premier Wulff had thought about an
official 'please explain' request as well as suing for damages. Mr Kohl
re-emphasised that he would not reveal the donors' names.

German Railways to axe up to 70,000 jobs
</H1>
New head of German Railways Ledorn intends to cut costs to the tune of
billions of marks, and also make ten-thousands redundant, preparing the
state-owned enterprise for a public float. Union spokesperson Kummer said
that some 35,000 socially-compatible redundancies were already planned
until
the year 2004, and apart from that, 3 billion marks/year in staff-related
expenses were to be cut, too. This would put some 35,000 jobs at risk. The
union announced that they would protest against these plans.
