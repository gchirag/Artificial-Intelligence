Wage settlement in the public sector
</H1>
The wage settlement in the public sector will cost federal, state and
local governments around 6 billion marks.  Thus spoke the finance minister
of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Schleusser, to the Cologne "Express."  The
unions had accepted the employers' offer by mid-afternoon.  According to
its terms, the 3.2 million employees at the federal, state and local level
will receive a raise of 3.1% starting April 1st.  For the months of
January through March, employers will pay 300 marks [on top of current
salaries].  The contract will be good for 15 months.

<P>
Public workers can probably count on cutbacks in overtime.  This is to be
addressed by an industry-wide agreement expected for July.

<P>
Otto Schily who, as Minister of the Interior, was the lead negotiator for
the federal government, said that a 3.1% increase would be a great burden
for federal, state and local governments.  But he added that public sector
wages should not lag behind the private sector.

<P>
At three rounds of discussion, this was the shortest wage negotiation the
public sector has ever experienced.

Road construction will not be cut in favor of train system
</H1>
In an interview, Chancellor Schroeder assured "Die Welt am Sonntag" that
there will be no cut-backs in road construction in order to improve the
train system.  What Schroeder literally said was that the government would
support the mobility of the citizens, which was based on cars and founded
on roads. The coalition agreement between the SPD and the Greens states
that expenditures on road and rail construction will be equalized by
stages in order to modernize the rail network.

The birth of a new party
</H1>
Former members of the SPD have founded a new party in Mecklenburg-Western
Pomerania.  The Social Liberals have only 20 founding members.  They all
left the SPD because they couldn't abide its cooperation with the PDS in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.  The new party will attempt to get a
foothold in other states as well.

Anti-nuclear demonstrations
</H1>
Several thousand anti-nuclear demonstrators protested against building a
long-term nuclear waste storage facility at Gorleben.  In addition, they
made clear their opposition to more Castor transports.  According to the
protestors, the red/green coalition doesn't have a clue how to proceed
despite their plans for a nuclear power pull-out.  As far as they are
concerned, that will only happen if there is pressure from below.  The
Minister of the Environment, Juergen Trittin, announced today that there
would be no Castor shipments this year.

Right wing extremists set to march
</H1>
Police in several East German cities fear that there will be clashes
between members of the extreme right-wing NPD and counter-demonstrators.
The NPD has fought at several levels of the judiciary for the right to
march in Magdeburg, in the Brandenburg town of Angermuende, and the Saxon
town of Wurzen.  The NPD is dead set against giving German citizenship to
immigrants. Ten youths were arrested in the vicinity of Angermuende for
disseminating Nazi propaganda.
