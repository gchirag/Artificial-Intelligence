Russia still opposes expansion of NATO to eastern European countries
</H1>
Russia is sticking to it's opposition to NATO extending
membership to Eastern European countries, in particularly countries from
the former Soviet Union. Russia's acting Minister of Foreign Affairs said
at the conference on Security Politics in Munich that Russia's position
regarding NATO applications from Poland and the Czech Republic was still
negative. He said that although his country did not have the right to
veto, they still could express their opinion on the matter. He continued
that cooperation between NATO and Russia would be better if the problem
of expansion to the Eastern European countries did not exist.

State elections in Hesse
</H1>
In the eastern German state of Hesse, 4.3 million voters were
called to the polls to vote for state parliament. The election was won by
the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Free Democrats (FDP) after eight
years of a red-green government in the state. Until election day itself,
pollsters had predicted that the SPD and Green party would have a slight
lead. The election campaign had mainly concentrated on the dispute
regarding changes to citizenship laws in Germany.

<P>
The next premier minister of the state of Hesse will most likely be from
the CDU. According to the last projections on the ARD TV station, the
CDU's top candidate, Roland Koch, had achieved 43.3 percent of the vote,
an increase of around four percentage points. His election to power will
depend on their proposed coalition partner's (FDP) election results. At
the moment it seems that the FDP have managed to overcome the five
percent hurdle by achieving 5.2 percent of the vote. In the last
election, however, the FDP had managed to achieve a result at least two
percentage points higher. According to current results, the current
red-green state government under the leadership of Hans Eichel have lost
the election. The SPD only attained 39.3 percent of the vote, and
although this was an increase of two percentage points the Greens had
only got 7.3 percent. If these results are confirmed, the red-green
coalition in Hesse will have lost the election and Hans Eichler will no
longer be the parliamentary leader of his party in state parliament.

Reactions in Bonn to the election in the state of Hesse
</H1>
After the disappointing election results in Hesse, the
Social Democrats are now looking at possible consequences at the federal
level. Mr. Schreiner, Federal Secretary General of the SPD, has hinted
that the reason for losing voters was due to the sort of PR of some
politicians in the Green Party and that this must stop. "We probably have
to think about emphasising social democratic areas of interest, such as
fighting unemployment, social justice and so on."

<P>
Angela Merkel, The General Secretary of the CDU, had said before the
election that if the CDU did well in the state elections in Hesse, this
would be a comment on the Juergen Trittin's (Greens) policies regarding
reducing atomic energy. Moreover, the government's plans regarding
citizenship laws had mobilised voters.
