Discussion on cabinet reshuffle continues
</H1>
Talk within governing coalition circles on reshuffling the cabinet
continues. In support of Finance Minister Theo Waigel and Bavaria's state
premier, Edmund Stoiber, CSU Vice-Secretary General Hermann has also
demanded that several ministers should be replaced. Mr. Hermann did not
specifically name areas where new appointments should be made, but he
renewed criticism of Minister of Agriculture Borchert (CDU). Without
explicitly naming him, Mr. Hermann said that the interests of the Christian
Social Union (CSU) were not well represented in the Ministry of
Agriculture. His party does not demand more ministerial posts in
compensation for Post Minister Boetsch whose office was being dissolved.
But Mr. Hermann stressed that the CSU's political influence should not
decrease. A slimmer Cabinet is to be welcomed. Mr. Hermann said the CSU
does not demand appointments but rather the right policy. At the same time,
Theo Waigel was criticized by the government because of his demand to
reshuffle the Cabinet. CDU budget politician Jacobi said the debate only
fills the summer recess and helps the political opponent.

Flood crisis team dissolved
</H1>
After the recession of the flood waters, the crisis team in
Brandenburg's Ministry of the Interior has concluded its work. The experts
will now coordinate donations and assess damages. The German Ministry of
Finance denied accusations that too much bureaucracy is involved in
handling flood relief. They said that the procedure which requires a
signature from a representative of the federal government as well as the
state does not make the approval of aid slower. The German Red Cross has
received 46 million Marks in donations for flood victims. The largest part
of that sum will go to Poland which was hit much harder than Brandenburg.
The repair of the damaged Oder dike in the Ziltendorf basin is taking
longer than expected. According to the Brandenburg Department for the
Environment, currents at the damaged spot near the town of Aurith are still
too fast. Repairs have been scheduled to begin today [Tuesday].

The Turkish airline Birgen Air is demanding damages from Germany in
connection with the crash of one of their airliners in the Dominican
Republic one and a half years ago. A lawyer for the company told the press
in Bonn that Birgen Air has demanded at least 20 million Marks. After the
crash, the German Ministry of Transportation was too hasty in making
incorrect and unfair comments which caused the airline substantial
problems. All 189 people on board died, most of whom were German tourists,
when the plane crashed.

Mr. Eppelmann, President of the CDU Employees' Association, has asked
Dieter Schulte, the President of the German Federation of Unions and the

debate with the Social Democrats (SPD). In a newspaper interview, Mr.
Eppelmann said that the government's plans to increase sales tax and lower
pension contributions are in accordance with demands by employers as well
as unions. Union representatives should therefore use their influence with
the SPD.

telephone immediately if charges suddenly rise dramatically and it is not
to be expected that the client will be able to pay the bill. This is

Inflation rate has risen
</H1>
The inflation rate in Germany rose in the past month to a new
high for the year. According to the Federal Department of Statistics, the
cost of living for private households was more than 1.9 percent than in the
previous year. Compared to the previous month, costs rose by 0.5 percent.
Inflation was aggravated by higher medical percription costs and affected
pensioners and welfare recipients, in particular. Another factor was the
increase in automobile tax. Consumers also had to pay more for coffee and
fish. The cost of living for East Germans was noticeably more expensive.
Annual inflation  in the East German states was 2.4 percent compared to
only 1.7 percent in the West. In spite of this unfavorable development, the
Bundesbank has not raised interest rates.

VCD: German cars use too much gas
</H1>
The Transportation Club of Germany (VCD) has accused the German
automobile industry of having missed out on the trend for making more
ecological cars. At the presentation of the 1997 ecological score card for
cars, the club said that gas consumption is as high as it was ten years
ago. The cars built are too big and too heavy and that ecologically minded
drivers should choose lower-powered motor cars when buying a car.
