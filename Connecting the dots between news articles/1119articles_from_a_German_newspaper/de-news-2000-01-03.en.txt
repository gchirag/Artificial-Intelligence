Investigations of Kohl start today
</H1>
Today, the district attorney's office in Bonn started its
investigations of CDU honorary chairperson Kohl in the campaign
contributions scandal.  At issue is the initial charge of breach of
trust to his own party. The former chancellor indicated before
Christmas he accepted approximately 2 million DM in campaign
contributions between 1993 and 1998 without correctly accounting for
the contributions. So far, the current party chairperson Schaeuble has
admitted differences in opinion with Kohl because his predecessor did
not want to release the contributors' names.  Because of the scandal,
the CDU has already re-written its statement of accounts for 1998 for
the Bundestag. It states that the origin of 2.4 million DM could not
be determined so far.

CSU claims not to have participated in payments from CDU faction
</H1>
The CSU members of parliament in the Bundestag deny any involvement in
payments by the CDU faction into the party accounts of the CDU. The
parliamentary secretary-general of the CSU in the Bundestag, Ramsauer,
said in an interview with the newspaper Bild that these were not joint
faction funds but, instead, a fund from CDU members of parliament. The
payments involve 1.15 milliom DM which were transferred as cash in
1997 from an account by the CDU faction to the CDU. Politicians from
SPD and Green Party asked CDU chairperson Schaeuble to state
unequivocally where the money came from and what it was used for.
According to party law, party contributions by parliamentary factions
are not allowed.

Schaeuble demands return to normal political discussions
</H1>
Despite the campaign contribution scandal, CDU leader Schaeuble asked
that his party be given back the right for a normal political
discussion.  He said in an interview with "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" that
the standards should not get lost. It would be completely
disproportionate to pretend that incorrect statements of accounts
could devalue the performance that the CDU had delivered, according to
Schaeuble. The CDU chairperson who has already come under fire because
of questionable payments by the faction to the party, stressed that he
did not want to cover anything up.  However, he rejected the procedure
against former chancellor Kohl. After all, the violations admitted to
by Kohl were not punishable.  Hesse's CDU admitted that it received an
interest-free loan of 1.5 million DM from its treasurer Prinz
Wittgenstein in 1998. The CDU in Ludwigshafen conceded that it
received a donation of 100,000 DM from Kohl in 1998. The money was
paid back.

increase the pressure on electricity groups. The chairperson of the
SPD faction of the Bundestag, Struck, named a deadline of 3 months in
the Bild-Zeitung; a joint solution would have to be reached within this
time frame. If an agreement with the energy sector could not be reached
in the next three months, Struck said that the coalition would introduce
an abandonment law in the Bundestag.

Electricity suppliers demand guarantees on remaining operating times
</H1>
Representatives from German electricity suppliers demand guarantees on
the remaining operating times of all nuclear power plants. This is a
reaction to the threat by SPD parliamentary party leader Struck to
decide the nuclear abandonment by law if there were no agreement
within the next three months. The spokesperson of "Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg," Wertel, said that an abandonment of nuclear
energy urgently required a collateral contract for the remaining
useful life of the plants. The state should commit itself for the full
remaining useful life to guarantee the operation of the reactors. In
addition, there should not be an emergency in the disposal of nuclear
waste. For more than one-and-a-half years, castor containers could not
be transported due to safety reasons.
