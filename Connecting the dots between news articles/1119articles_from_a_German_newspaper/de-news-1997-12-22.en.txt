Ost cautions against strike in eastern German steel industry
</H1>
The chairman of the economic committee of the Bundestag warned against a
labour battle in the eastern German steel industry. Ost said that while
faced with a difficult economic situation in this region, the IG Metall
(metal-workers' union) would cause damage to the region and its unemployed
if it went forward with the strike. All parties involved would have to do
their best to avoid this. The IG Metall local chairman for Berlin,
Brandenburg and Saxony, Duevel, emphasised the union's willingness to go on
strike. On Deutschlandfunk radio he said that the issue was above all
political. Because the amount was rather small, the employers obviously
wanted to stop the process of adjustment to the western German level. In 
an
IG Metall ballot, about 78% of the members voted to go on strike in
mid-January.

Still disagreement on Garzweiler 2
</H1>
In Duesseldorf, leading politicians of the North Rhine-Westphalian Green
Party discussed the conflict with the Social Democrats on the surface brown
coal mining project Garzweiler 2. The joint coalition commission is
scheduled to meet as a mediation instance. Last night, a final mediation
attempt in the chancery of state ended without results. 

<P>
Environmental minister Hoehn accused her Social Democratic colleague
Clement, state minister of economics, of having passed a draft version of
the plant regulations plan to Rhein Braun, which runs Garzweiler 2, not
including the modifications planned by her ministry. According to the Green
Party, the final version of this plan is not yet available to the minister
of the environment. The dispute between Hoehn and Clement mainly concerns
the question whether the plant regulation plan contains solutions for all
legal problems concerning water quality. According to the Greens, the
Social Democrats deny that the minister of the environment is fully
responsible. Clement has not yet answered the accusations. At a special
party meeting on January 17, the Greens plan to decide if they will remain
in the coalition.

No agreement on transport of nuclear waste via Bremerhaven
</H1>
In the morning representatives of the environmental organisation Greenpeace
met Mr. Beckmeyer, port senator of Bremen, to discuss the planned transport
of nuclear waste to Scotland. According to a correspondent of
Deutschlandfunk radio, Beckmeyer agreed not to have future transports go
through Bremerhaven, but the plutonium from Hanau now waiting in the
harbour would be shipped as planned. Greenpeace representatives had
rejected this plan. Since this morning members of the organisation have
been blocking the ferry Arneb. Seven environmental activists chained
themselves to the container ship to stop the transport. A speaker of
Greenpeace said that the block would continue. The activists had called on
the port senator to stop transports of nuclear waste via Bremerhaven
immediately. According to Greenpeace the captain of the Arneb had tried to
open the back door from inside just before the negotiations.
At the moment the Bremerhaven coast guard is on board of the Arneb to
de-escalate the tense situation.
