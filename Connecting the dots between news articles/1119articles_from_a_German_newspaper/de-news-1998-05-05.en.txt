National Poverty Conference: growing social exclusion
</H1>
The national poverty conference has complained of the growing social
exclusion in Germany. Speakers at the meeting stated that a growing number
of households are living just above the poverty line. Meanwhile, for the
first time since reunification, the proportion of wealthy households has
risen, from four to five percent. It is mainly long-term unemployment which
causes the fall into poverty and social exclusion. The speakers demanded a
significant expansion of social-security payable, union wage agreed
employment as the only way to take those affected out of the social
security trap. The poverty conference is a joint initiative of welfare
groups, unions and self-help groups.

SPD: Kohl responsible for misery in east German labour market
</H1>
The Social Democrats have claimed Kohl is responsible for the misery in the
east German labour market. SPD fraction leader Scharping and a Saxony MP
Schwanitz said in Bonn that by setting the wrong political course, the
federal government has brought the recovery of the new Laender to its
knees. A long-term continuation of labour market measures in east Germany
is unavoidable, in order to prevent a further increase in unemployment
there. If they win at the federal elections the SPD will make more money
available for employment promotion.
