Iran's foreign minister warns Europe of endangering its interests in Iran
</H1>
Iran's foreign minister warned Europe of endangering its interests in Iran.
He said that neither Germany nor the other European states should link
their political and economic relations to a' sentence passed by a
dishonourable judge. However,  no statements were made to the effect that
the sentence of the Mykonos trial in Berlin was wrong, and therefore that
it was unfounded to accuse the Iranian government of state terrorism.
Rallies against Germany took place in Teheran and other Iranian cities.

<P>
Protesters threw stones and tomatoes at the German embassy in Teheran. Two
of the estimated 2000 protesters tried to climb over an additional
barricade constructed by the security forces in front of the embassy, but
were beaten down by policemen. The anti-German demonstration in Teheran
took a normal course without serious hitches. Security experts rate the
danger of terrorist attacks as a reaction to the sentence as low. An
Israeli specialist said that Iran will even reduce its terrorist activities
after the Mykonos sentence in order to avoid damage to its economy.

off of relations with Iran. In his first public statement since the Mykonos
sentence, Mr. Kinkel told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" that  critical
dialogue will not be continued for the time being. According to Mr. Kinkel,
the findings of the court in Berlin regarding the participation of the

policy toward the Teheran leadership in late April. Reacting to this, the

</H1>
Experts of the governing coalition are meeting in Bad Neuenahr to discuss a
joint pension concept. This closed meeting is being chaired by the Minister
of Employment, Norbert Bluem. The experts will talk about lowering pensions
from  the current level and will discuss whether tax funds should be used
to assist pension funds. Mrs. Babe of the Free Democrats (FDP) mentioned
prior to the meeting that there are still several points open to
discussion, but that she expects to achieve an agreement during this
two-day meeting. The FDP assumes that  lowering the pensions from the
current 70 percent of the average net income to 64 percent in the year 2012
is possible. The Union (CDU/CSU), however, wants to achieve that standard
only by the year 2030.
