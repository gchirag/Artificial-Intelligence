Compromise for tax law 1997
</H1>
After the governing coalition and the SPD had adjourned their consultations on
the tax law 1997 without having reached a consensus late at night, the
mediation committee negotiated a compromise in the afternoon, with the
Coalition and SPD agreeing to compensation measures of 8.1 billion DM.
According to the mayor of Hamburg, Mr. Voscherau, a solution is possible, but
not sure.  The announcement of funds to reimburse the states, which will have
to do without the tax on cash assets starting next year, could not be relied
on any more.  The abolition of that tax is likely to drive down revenue by 8
to 9 billion DM.  The federal government offered an increase in inheritance
and property purchase tax as compensation, but that would only raise 6
billion.  The proposal was rejected by the states.  The mediation committee of
Bundestag and Bundesrat continued consultations on the tax law 1997 in the
evening.

Schedule for government relocation to Berlin still open

schedule for the parliament's relocation to Berlin.  The heads of the parties'
parliamentary groups and the President of Parliament Ms. Suessmuth convened
for a meeting in the evening to find a solution.  In particular, it is
controversial how the period between completion of the Parliament building

1999, the office building for the members of parliament half a year later.
