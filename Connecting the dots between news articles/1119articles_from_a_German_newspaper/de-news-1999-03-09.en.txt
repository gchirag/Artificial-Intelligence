Attack on controversial Wehrmacht exhibition
</H1>
A bombing attack has been committed this morning in
Saarbruecken on the controversial Wehrmacht exhibition [the Wehrmacht were
Germany's Armed Forces during the Nazi era]. According to police, the
explosives were attached from outside to the Volkshochschule building
[community evening school] that hosts the exhibition right now. The impact
of the explosion damaged many parts of the exhibition. A spokesperson of
the state's criminal police said he believed the bomb had been made
professionally.

<P>
The Wehrmacht exhibition had in particular been criticized by the
right-wing political spectrum since it looks at the role of the Wehrmacht
during the Nazi era from a critical point of view.

<P>
Saarland's State Premier, Mr Klimmt, branded the attack as a criminal act.
It highlightened in a shocking way that in Germany violence was still part
of the political dispute. The Hamburg Institute for Social Studies who
created the concept of the exhibition called the bombing an attack on
Science and Research.

No agreement in Energy consensus talks
</H1>
The energy sector and the Federal government did not find an
agreement in their dispute on nuclear reserve funds [financial reserves of
nuclear power plant operators]. At a meeting at the Chancellor's office,
both sides solely agreed to investigate together the new burdens for the
sector implied by the planned partial taxation of the reserves.  A working
group will be founded to look into this matter. Only after these question
will be resolved, the two parties will decide whether to continue the
energy consensus talks or not. Representatives from the energy sector have
estimated the extra burdens at some DM 25 billion and called these burdens
unbearable. The Federal Finance Ministry, on the other hand, had
calculated the extra burdens at only DM 11 billion.

<P>
Contrary to earlier plans, the details of the phasing out of the nuclear
power production were discussed today.

Slight rise in unemployment
</H1>
After a slump in employment in the past months, the
German labour market stabilized in February. According to the Federal
Labour Office, the number of unemployed people slightly rose compared to
January, to a new total of 4.465 million. The unemployment rate is now
11.6%, up from 11.5%. Federal Labour Office's President Bernhard Jagoda
qualified the slight rise as being seasonal. The increase by 9,700 in the
number of unemployed people mostly originated from the extremely cold and
snowy weather. It was still unclear how the weak economic climate
influenced the job market so far.

<P>
Compared to February last year, the number of unemployed people went down
by 350,000. In the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, 353,000 people were
unemployed, 2,000 less than in January.

<P>
The Social Democrats welcomed the new figures. They showed in their
opinion that the creation of new jobs continued. Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine said, for seasonal reasons the unemployment rate will drop
considerable in March. The Christian Demorcrats (CDU), however, interprete
the new figures differently: in their opinion they showed that the
red-green coalition government's economics' and fiscal policies destroyed
jobs. CDU's secretary-general, Ms Merkel, said the red-green fiscal chaos
prevented new investments.

Government struggles with reform of citizenship code
</H1>
This Thursday the government will determine its final stand on the reform
of the citizenship code. An enlarged coalition assembly of
Social-Democrats and Greens will negotiate the reform. The meeting is led
by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. After a meeting of the leaders of both
factions there is still disagreement about the exact set-up of the
citizenship code. The discussion centers on the model proposed by the
Rhineland-Palatinate SPD/FDP coalition government restricts double
citizenship to certain groups of children born in Germany by foreigners.
At age 23 these persons would have to decide between the German and the
foreign citizenship. According to government sources, federal Interior
Minister Otto Schily and the FDP have already agreed on this "choice
model". Mr. Schily and FDP representatives will meet on Thursday to
discuss further details. Buendnis90/Greens have reservations about the
Choice Model because it is not endorsed by party resolutions.

NRW minister of justice resigns after only eight days in office
</H1>
The Minister of Justice of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Rauball (SPD), has
resigned after only eight days in office. Mr. Rauball stated that as a
lawyer he had not applied for the necessary approval by the control
authority to assume his mandate as a member of the supervisory board of a
foreign company. Therefore he is expecting a disciplinary investigation
that is irreconcilable with the office of justice minister. State Premier
Wolfgang Clement accepted Mr. Rauball's resignation. Mr. Clement will fill
in as Minister of Justice until he has nominated a successor.

Emergency programme against youth unemployment had a good start
</H1>
The emergency programme against youth unemployment has had a good start
according to the federal government. Two months after the start of the
100,000-jobs programme, almost half of the training jobs have been given
to applicants. Thus, the number of unemployed under 25 years of age
decreased to 9% compared to last year or 490,000. Minister of Youths
Christine Bergmann called on labour offices, youth authorities, and
schools to co-operate more closely in procuring these jobs. If necessary
the programme could be enlarged. The programme is targeting mostly
disadvantaged youths.  The German Federation of Unions (DGB) accused the
industry of continuing to reduce the number of training jobs in spite of
their promises.
