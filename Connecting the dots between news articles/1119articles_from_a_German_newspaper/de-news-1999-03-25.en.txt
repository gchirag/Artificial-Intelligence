Renewed military attack on Yugoslavia
</H1>
NATO began another wave of attacks against Yugoslavia at nightfall. A US
destroyer stationed in the Adriatic as well as other military ships fired
numerous cruise missiles. Simultaneously, several fighter jets took off from
Italian military bases heading in the direction of Yugoslavia. Before this
second attack, NATO threatened to intensify the bombings systematically. NATO
Supreme Commander Wesley Clark did not exclude the complete destruction of
their forces and support facilities.

Diplomatic ties severed
</H1>
In reaction to the attacks, Yugoslavia has apparently cut diplomatic relations
with several western countries, including the US, Great Britain, France, and
Germany. The government in Belgrade declared that these countries had
committed a crime against the people of Yugoslavia. The Federal Republic was
accused of reopening the unhealed wounds of World War II through this act of
aggression.

PDS suit challenging NATO operation dismissed
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court dismissed a suit as inadmissible that was
brought by the PDS parliamentary group challenging German participation in the
NATO operation in Yugoslavia. The second senate determined unanimously that
the PDS was not authorized to file the petition since neither its own nor the
rights of the German Bundestag had been infringed upon. The justices also
noted that the petition did not address the legality of German participation
in the operation.

Further discussions on Agenda 2000
</H1>
After many individual discussions, the heads of state and heads of government
from European Union countries are again formally negotiating the reform
program Agenda 2000. The negotiations in Berlin have thus entered the decisive
phase. It is considered questionable whether an agreement will be reached by
tomorrow (Friday) morning. Points still being debated are cuts in future EU
expenditures for agriculture as well as the amount of funds that will be used
to support the poorer countries and economically weak regions. Foreign
Minister Joschka Fischer said that the discussions were very difficult.
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson said that he was not optimistic.
