News from the Party funding scandal
</H1>
In May at the earliest, the inquiry committee of the Bundestag will
interrogate Ex-Chancellor Kohl. Today Kohl informed auditors instructed by the
CDU about the practice of Party funding during his term of office. Chancellor
Schroeder distanced himself from considerations of the inquiry committee to put
Kohl into jail in case he does not tell the names of the contributors.
Schroeder's opinion is that Kohl knows about his duties as a citizen and that he
will fulfill these. In the meantime, the CDU-Secretary General, Merkel,
indirectly appealed to the former Chancellor to reveal the names. But the
substitute CDU-leader, Ruehe, appealed to the contributors themselves to
confess. Apparently at the same time, the search in the Chancellor's Office for
the vanished documents concerning the sale of the Leuna-Factory to the French
company Elf-Aquitaine continues. According to Government speaker Heye, it turned
out that the originals in several folders are missing. At the best, there are
copies, but some folders are totally empty. And this does not only concern the
files of the Leuna-deal.
