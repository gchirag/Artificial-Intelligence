SPD solicits all parties' approval of Rau
</H1>
The SPD wants to win the approval of all parties for the election of
Johannes Rau for President. SPD head Lafontaine made the announcement
today after Rau's nomination. "Because of his personality and his
experience, Rau is the right candidate," said Lafontaine. It is more
than unlikely that Rau will be the only candidate to succeed Roman
Herzog. It seems certain however that Herzog will not be running for a
second term. There are no doubts that Rau will be elected the second
social-democratic President. The red-green coalition also has a solid
majority in the Presidential Election Council.
