Discussions about shopping hours law continue
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder rejected demands to abolish
the shopping hours limit on weekdays. The demand had been put forward
by the Federal Association of German Retailers (HDE) at its delegate
conference. The chancellor said that this demand would not be realized.
The legislature and those concerned should take their time to find a
reasonable regulation and not be hasty. HDE president Hermann Frantzen
demanded that conditions across the country had to be made similar
again. He hoped that a new law could be passed by the end of next year.
He also demanded that shopping be allowed on four Sundays per year
without a particular occasion. The HDE delegates dismissed keeping the
8pm-closing time and adopted a motion for unlimited shopping hours.

Emergency scheme to fight youth unemployment successful
</H1>
The federal government's emergency scheme to fight youth
unemployment was only partially successful, said Dieter Hundt,
president of the employers' association. Youths who did not finish
school or have been unemployed for more than six months were rarely
helped by the scheme. Those groups, however, were the most problematic
ones. The president of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda had
said earlier that the emergency scheme was showing signs of success.
There were fewer open positions and more placed youths.

Rallies by DGB and government employees against savings
</H1>
About 50.000 people participated in the rallies of the German
Federation of Unions (DGB) and the German Alliance of Civil Servants.
So far, this was the largest demonstration against the savings plan of
the federal government. The rallies' slogan was "Free negotiation of
pay, not dictation". The government had announced that for the next two
years the pay of civil servants would rise only in line with inflation.
The president of the Civil Servants Alliance, Erhard Geyer, said it was
utterly anti-social to decouple civil servants of German Post, fire
brigades, and other important services from the general increase of
income. The second demand was to raise wages in the eastern states to
those in the western states. It is impossible to treat employees in the
east as second-class workers ten years after the fall of the Berlin
Wall.
