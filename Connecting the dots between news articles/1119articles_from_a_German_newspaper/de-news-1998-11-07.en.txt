CDU party convention in Bonn
</H1>
Wolfgang Schaeuble has been elected the new CDU chairmen by an
overwhelming majority at the CDU party convention in Bonn.  He succeeds
Helmut Kohl.  872 votes were cast in his favor, 56 against and 23
abstained.  In his acceptance speech, he said the CDU continues to have
the potential to garner majorities.  The CDU should be open to new ideas
and entertain a dialog with all social groups.  Mr. Schaeuble sharply
criticized Chancellor Schroeder whom he called the "Chancellor of
arbitrariness."

<P>
Angela Merkel is the new Secretary General of the CDU.  874 delegates of
the party convention voted for the former environmental minister to
succeed Peter Hintze.  Norbert Bluem, Volker Ruehe, Annette Schavan and
Christian Wulf were elected deputy chairmen.  At 88.8 per cent of the
votes, Mr. Schavan received the most solid endorsement, Mr. Bluem the
poorest with 60.2 per cent.  Former Bundestag President Rita Suessmuth has
lost her seat on the CDU's executive board, as did Mr. Escher, head of the
CDU young people's organization.

<P>
Helmut Kohl has unanimously been elected honorary chairman of the CDU.
In his final speech as party chief, he called on the Christian Democrats
to stay in the political middle.  The CDU must remain the homing ground
for Christian-social, liberal and conservative values and ideals. In his
encomium, Norbert Bluem praised Kohl for his life's work and called him
the "Chancellor of Peace in this century."

Schroeder favors full pension benefits at 60
</H1>
Workers and employees should be able to retire at 60 with full pension
benefits, Chancellor Schroeder said in an interview with "Bild am
Sonntag."  He proposed that this solution can be reached through the
cooperation of all parties in the collective bargaining process.  He has
ruled out an increase in the sales tax before 2000.  The solidarity
surcharge tax on income is to remain in effect unchanged for the next five
years.  As the Federal Ministry of Finance stated to the news magazine
"Focus," the funding for rebuilding former East Germany has already been
ratified through 2004.

Dispute between coalition partners over ecological tax
</H1>
A skirmish has arisen between the coalition partners over the proposed
environmental taxes.  Minister of the Environment Trittin expects the
dispute to be settled by Monday.  The bone of contention is which
enterprises are to be exempted from the energy consumption tax.  Mr.
Mueller, the Economics Minister from the SPD, declared that all
manufacturers should be exempted.  Green politicians contend this is
unacceptable on ecological, economic and social grounds.  The only
businesses Greens want to exempt are those which produce electricity from
renewable sources.

Coalition in favor of "family doctor model"
</H1>
According to SPD health policy expert Kirschner, the new reform of the
health care system will contain the so-called "family doctor model" of
health insurance.  In this model, insurance customers would be offered a
discount of up to 20 percent on premiums, Mr. Kirschner told the "Koelner
Express." In turn, the insurance-holder is required to always consult the
family doctor first for all medical problems.

Alternative Trans-Rapid route
</H1>
Minister President Clement of North Rhine-Westphalia has confirmed plans
for the construction of a Trans-Rapid line between the Cologne airport and
Dusseldorf, if the project between Hamburg and Berlin falls through. Mr.
Clement has already discussed this alternative route with Mr. Rohkamm, the
chairman of Thyssen Industry, according to a report by "Focus."  The plans
provide for running the tracks along the A3 freeway.  The property
adjacent to the A3 belongs to the federal government.  Federal
Transportation Minister Muentefering, however, insists on the
Hamburg-Berlin route.

Remembrance of Nazi crimes
</H1>
At the 60th anniversary of the "Reichsprogrom-Nacht," the beginning of
overt Jewish repression by the Nazis in the Third Reich, leading
politicians and Church representatives have called for remembrance of the
crimes of National Socialism.  Bundestag President Thierse said that
Germany needs places of commemoration for the victims of nationalistic
racism.  The German Bishop's Convention said in a statement that those who
simply want to forget are erasing the history of a people and its members.
