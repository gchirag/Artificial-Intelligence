Massive protests against cuts in coal subsidies
</H1>
Tens of thousands of miners in the state of Saarland and the Ruhr
Area have demonstrated against the planned cuts to coal subsidies before
tomorrow's coal mining meeting in the Chancellor's Office. Several
thousand protesters are still blocking the party centers of the CDU and
FDP in Bonn. The government plans to cut the coal subsidies from yearly
nine million DM to 3.8 million by the year 2005.

<P>
"It is not the ones who shout the loudest who get the most money", CDU
secretary-general Peter Hintze reacted to the miners' protest in Bonn. He
said that the State Premiers of Saarland and North Rhine-Westphalia,
Oskar Lafontaine and Johannes Rau, had driven the miners out into the
streets with their irresponsible expressions of opinion. Guido
Westerwelle, secretary-general of the FDP, expressed his sympathy for
livelihood concerns of the miners but said that the misguided state
policy of the SPD, having neglected urgent modernizations in the mining
areas, is to be blamed. Westerwelle stated that the offer for 3.8 million
Mark subsidies by the year 2005 is the limit of what the government would
be able to justify.

Lafontaine demands new plans to fight unemployment
</H1>
Oskar Lafontaine, the chairman of the SPD, has called on the government
to present new concepts for fighting unemployment. Otherwise there would
be no further negotiations on the tax reform, Lafontaine stated after an
SPD executive board session in Berlin. In addition, he appealed once more
to the government to reconsider its plans regarding the cutting of the
coal subsidies.

<P>
In Munich, Federal Finance Minister Waigel presented the opinion that an
agreement with the Social Democrats on the tax reform would be possible
before Easter. According to him, the government will present a
comprehensive plan next week. Then the SPD would have to decide between
co-operation and confrontation.

Seehofer establishes higher deductibles
</H1>
Ignoring the criticism of doctors and health insurance organizations, the
government coalition in Bonn has apparently settled its health reform
dispute. In addition to CDU social politicians, the FDP also expressed
its consent to Federal Minister Seehofer's plan for raising deductibles
on medications and other medical services. The chairman of the health
committee of the Bundestag, Thomae (sp?), said on Deutschlandradio Berlin
that the purpose of the measures was to increase the individual
responsibility of the insured. At a board meeting in Munich, the CSU
approved Seehofer's plans. Afterwards, the minister said that the new
deductible plan would result in a lowering of costs and that it called
for raising deductibles for medications and hospitalizations by mid-
1997.

BSE cow Cindy not born in Germany
</H1>
According to the Federal Ministry of Agriculture, Cindy, the cow that
died of bovine brain disease BSE in Germany at the end of last year, had
been imported directly from the UK. DNA analyses by two scientific
institutes had proved that, Secretary of State Feiter (sp?) said in Bonn.
With a 95 per cent probability the cow, which in Germany had been called
Cindy, was a British import cow called Scottish Queen.

<P>
Feiter said that thus there is no single case of cattle born here
contracting BSE. The German housewife could presume that buying German
meat in Germany meant no BSE risk, Feiter added.

Luebeck: Fire started from outside?
</H1>
According to an expert opinion by the Frankfurt fire expert
Achilles (sp?), the fire in an asylum shelter in Luebeck might possibly
have been set from the outside. The fire on January 18, 1996 killed ten
people. The Lebanese citizen Safwan Eid is accused of setting fire as a
revenge against a fellow resident.

<P>
Achilles disagrees with the public prosecutor's theory that the fire had
started on the second floor of the shelter. The worst damage was located
in a frontal building addition, and the three so-called through-burns
could have originated from liquid fuels. Achilles also showed photos in
which flames are visible, both in the addition and on the second floor.
The drawback is that there is no evidence on the time of shooting of the
pictures. Experts from the state (LKA) and the federal criminal bureaus
(BKA) do support the public prosecution's theory that the fire was set on
the second floor.
