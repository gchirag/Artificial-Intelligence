New round of tax talks possible
</H1>
The SPD and the federal government intend to resume discussions about the tax reform. After his Easter vacation, Chancellor Kohl said that he would participate in an extended round table discussion if the SPD insisted on it, but
the details of the tax reform could only be worked out in the joint committee. Finance minister Waigel expressed a similar opinion. The head of the SPD, Oskar Lafontaine, said the next tax summit could only lead to an agreement if the government reconsidered its position regarding several issues. The SPD approved Kohl's statement in principle. Lafontaine announced that a date would be agreed on within the next few days.

SPD board meets in Bonn
</H1>
For the tax reform, the SPD demands an increase not only of the base tax-free allowance but also of child benefits. After a meeting of the board, SPD leader Lafontained said one should consider an additional ten to 30 marks a month. He also called on Chancellor Kohl again to state explicitly whether the financial framework of the tax reform according to the coalition's plan was to be taken seriously. Public budgets could not cope with the planned additional deficit of over 50 bio. marks. Lafontaine confirmed plans to present his own design for a tax reform but said that he wanted to wait until the tax estimates in May. He also said that the SPD sees no reason to name its candidate for Chancellor ahead of time and that this was a unanimous decision
by the board. Chancellor Kohl's announcement to run for office again did not change the situation. According to Lafontaine, the Social Democrats welcomed Kohl's decision because now he would have to personally justify his policies to the voters.
