</H1>
The heads of state of 30 countries wrapped up the OSZE-summit meeting in
Istanbul by accepting a new European Charter for Security, plus signing the
the final communique - which had been contentious so far. The charter is to
boost the role of the OSZE, and make it easier for them to send observers to
areas of conflict. In the final communique, Russia for the first time since
the beginning of the Chechnya conflict, accepts the OSZE's role as mediator.
Previously the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (KSE) had been
signed. This treaty sets new caps on the number of heavy arms.

permit labelling down to the retail level, and that would also apply to
meat-products such as sausages containing British beef. Federal Health
Minister Fischer had stated that labelling would be an absolute requirement
for calling an end to the German embargo of British beef. As of 1 August,
exports of British beef to EU-countries have resumed.

clean police-record and the ability to support themselves. According to

asylum, who had been turned down, would be affected. Refugees from the
Kosovo area, however, are to be returned to their home country in spring
