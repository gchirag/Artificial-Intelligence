Federal government in favor of alliance for democracy and tolerance
</H1>
Confronted with continuing xenophobia in Germany, the Federal Government
called for an alliance for democracy and tolerance. Interior Minister Otto
Schily and Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin introduced the initiative
in Berlin. The alliance's goal is to encourage the populace to stand up for
one's beliefs. The citizens should be brave enough to intervene when they see
foreigners being insulted or harmed. Churches, the media, grass-roots action
groups, and sports clubs would take part in the planned projects against
xenophobia. Interior Minister Schily pointed out that the number of
right-wing extremists increased again last year.

Payment attitude worse
</H1>
The Federal Association of Collection Agencies is bemoaning the worsening of
Germans' attitudes toward paying their bills. In private as well as in
business spheres, more and more people are not paying their bills on time
according to the Association. There are reportedly 2.6 million households
that are currently overextended. Compared with 1994, this represents an
increase of about 30 percent. The Association cites the main reason for the
increasing number of debtors as stemming from the many companies that have
gone bankrupt and the resulting unemployment.
