</H1>
New York, USA. German Foreign Minister Kinkel, speaking at the General
Assembly of the United Nations, has reiterated Germany's desire for a
permanent seat on the Security Council, and also called for a quick
decision concerning the acceptance of new members. Kinkel justified his
comments by saying that the Security Council, as a significant organ of
the UN, must reflect the political realities of today, rather than
remaining stuck in the year 1945, as far as its composition is concerned.
Kinkel also called for a re-organization of the UN's work, in order to be
better able to deal with the world's most urgent problems. As examples, he
named the protection of the ozone layer, the abolition of anti-personnel
mines, and the containment of weapons of mass destruction.

Seehofer demands states watch meat industry more closely
</H1>
After revelations of illegal meat imports from Great Britain,
Federal Health Minister Seehofer has called on the states to implement
tighter controls. He added that Germany's position in the European Union
had already been damaged by the inadequacies European inspectors had found
in the German meat industry. According to the minister, the supervision of
hygienic regulations is clearly and exclusively a state responsibility.
The EU Commission officially informed the federal government of
shortcomings at individual meat plants on Monday, also demanding the
closure of one company in Schleswig-Holstein. That state's Environmental
Ministry is to deal with the matter tomorrow; according to a spokesman,
the company's permit will be revoked.

Cabinet approves higher education bill and Euro-dollar bill
</H1>
SPD politicians have accused the Government of trying to push
through the amendment to the Higher Education Law on their own without any
consultation or debate in the Bundestag.  Rhineland-Palatinate's Education
Minister Zoellner, and North-Rhine-Westphalia's Science Minister Brunn
emphasized that, in the view of the state governments, the bill does
require additional approval from the Bundesrat. The federal cabinet
approved the amendment, which is intended to make studies at German
institutions of higher learning shorter and more efficient, today in Bonn.
The cabinet also approved a bill dealing with the introduction of the
Euro-dollar. It contains numerous regulations intended to ensure a smooth
transition from Deutschemark to euro following the planned implementation

Bosses behind extended Deutsche Bank credit given to Schneider
</H1>
The granting of extended credit to property speculator
Schneider by the Deutsche Bank after 1985 occurred "at the bosses'
prerogative". A member of the bank's board of directors, Krupp, made this
statement before Hesse's Regional Court today. He admitted that cautionary
checks failed as a result of insufficient information and documentation.
Krupp placed the responsibility for the matter on himself as well as
another board member, Weiss. Weiss is also to appear in court as a
witness. Krupp said the reason for continuing to grant Schneider credit
was that the bank found itself between a rock and a hard place. He said it
was in the bank's own best interest to ensure that Schneider's
half-finished projects had the financing to see them through to
completion.
