Greens party convention in Kassel
</H1>
The Greens want to prevail over massive unemployment by a drastic
reduction in work hours and more part-time work. At their party convention in
Kassel, the Greens spent a long time discussing a comprehensive plan which
they hope to make part of their election campaign platform. At the beginning
of the convention, Juergen Trittin, Greens head spokesperson, called for a new
political beginning with a red-green (SPD-Greens) coalition. The chances for a
change of power in Bonn were better than ever, he noted. The central topics of
discussion at the convention were basic social assistance, the euro, and
pensions.

Armed robber apparently escapes after releasing hostage
</H1>
An armed robber who had taken a hostage during a bank hold-up yesterday
afternoon in Bocholt, Lower Rhine, has apparently escaped to the Netherlands.
Dutch police were not able to track down the gangster as he made his way from
Bocholt, despite the intervention of a special police unit. The suspect,
approximately 25 years old and most likely a Dutchman, released his final
hostage in the border city of Hengelo after a frenzied getaway along the Lower
Rhine. He got away on foot under the cover of night, still in possession of
his sub-machine-gun. In Wesel, the public prosecutor's office and the
authorities are investigating how one victim, a 33 year old man, laid in his
car for over two hours after police mistakenly assumed he was dead. The
gangster shot at the man's car when the man refused to stop. The police
considered the man to be fatally wounded. It remains unclear whether the
emergency medical technician was so engaged in treating other injuries at the
scene that he neglected to fully administer medical care to the gun-shot
victim. The doctor allegedly examined the victim after two hours and
discovered that the man still had a pulse. The man then died during emergency
treatment.

Chlorine Gas Accident in a Tuebingen Indoor Swimming Pool
</H1>
A chlorine gas accident in an indoor swimming pool in Tuebingen
required the involvement of the police, fire department and the Red Cross.
128 people, many of whom were children, were taken to hospitals for treatment
of respiratory problems. More than half of the patients were released late in
the evening. No one's life was in danger. The exact cause of the chlorine gas
accident is being investigated by officials of the Industrial Safety Office
and the criminal investigation department. A bottle in the room where chlorine
is kept was apparently found to be defective. It has not yet been established
how the irritant gas came into the swimming pool area.
