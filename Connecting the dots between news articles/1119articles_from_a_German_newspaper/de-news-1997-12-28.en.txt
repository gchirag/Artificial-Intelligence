Head of DGB against maintaining lower wages
</H1>
Frankfurt am Main. Dieter Schulte, the chairman of the German Trade Union
Federation (DGB) has stated that he is against maintaning lower wages for
employees in the next round of wage negotiations. He said in an interview
that employees had already conceded all they could to tariff politics and
that this should now reach an end. Mr. Schulte referred to the financial
burdens of employees in the last year as well as the contributions to
ensuring Germany's place in industry. Mr. Schulte demanded that employers
break this trend in return for employees' contributions. He warned that if
they didn't, unions would have to use other negotiation policies in the
next round of wage negotiations. The next important negotiations will be
for the public service in three weeks time.

Zwickel criticises employers in metal industry
</H1>
Klaus Zwickel, the chairman of the Union for Metal, Engineering
and Electronics ( IG Metall), has accused employers in the metal industry
of wanting to damage the industry's blanket wage agreement. He said to the
"Handelsblatt" newspaper that the employers' association for the metal
industry, "Gesamtmetall" were trying to attain American conditions. This
was in response to the suggestion made by Mr. Stumpfe, the president of the
employers' association, that responsibility for negotiating wage
agreements be ceded to individual companies in the industry. Mr. Stumpfe
said that this would result in the industry's blanket agreement having no
content and that the unions would thus have little right to strike.
According to Mr. Zwickel, IG Metall plans to decide on the main issues for
the wage negotiations in January.

CDU/CSU support central corruption register
</H1>
Local and central politicians of the CDU/CSU want companies who had
obtained contracts by bribes to be punished. Mr. Boehr, the chairman of the
CDU in Rhineland-Palitinate, has, for example, would like the names of
so-called corrupt firms who have been convicted of bribing to be kept in a
central corruption register for five years in order that they are not
awarded any government contracts. According to public prosecutors in
Frankfurt and Munich specialising in this area, corruption in Germany is
increasing. Mr. Schaupensteiner, the chief public prosecutor of Frankfurt,
has been quoted as saying that corruption played a role in half all
contracts for government buildings, resulting in an inflation of costs of
about 30 percent.

Wulf supports ecology tax reform
</H1>
Mr. Wulf, the CSU's top candidate for Lower Saxony , has called
for ecological tax reforms. He said to the German Press Agency that
indirect taxes such as sales and mineral oil taxes must be increased in the
next few years. This should be counterbalanced by decreasing taxes on
wages. However, reforming the tax system to support ecological issues would
also call for changes in structures, he said, and that internal German
politics seems to lack the strength to do this.

Drechsler: Teufel should take legal action against fiscal equalisation
</H1>
Mr. Drechsler, the general secretary for the SPD in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, has demanded that state government take legal action
against the fiscal equalisation agreement of the German states. He said
that the system of equalisation was unjust and had to be changed. He added
that it was not comprehensible why Premier Minster Teufel has threatened to
take legal action through the Federal Constitutional Court for months
without ever having done so. He added that if Mr. Teufel had misgivings
that the equalisation was really unconstitutional, he should consider
political negotiation rather than legal action.
