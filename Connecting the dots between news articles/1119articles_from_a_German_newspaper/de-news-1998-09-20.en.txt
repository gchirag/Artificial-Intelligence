</H1>
The president of the Bundestag (Lower House) Rita Suessmuth has
called for better protection of children from sexual assaults. During the
central rally opening World Children's Day, Ms. Suessmuth also said that
children whose parents are unemployed should not be pushed into welfare.

half million children in Germany depend on welfare. The organization views

world public follows most private occurrences with hypocritical greed on
the Internet "makes me sick", the Chancellor said. It is bad that the most
important power in the world indulges in an interior debate, as if there

Demands for reorientation of Bavarian SPD
</H1>
The Secretary General of the Bavarian Social Democratic Party (SPD)
Hoderlein had demanded a reorientation of his party when choosing top
candidates in the future. Mr. Hoderlein said that the SPD has to find a
completely new strategy if not even a woman like Renate Schmidt can
undermine the Christian Social Union's (CSU) position. He can imagine that
his party could find an experienced federal SPD Minister or a popular
Bavarian SPD Mayor to run against the CSU. In the last state election the
SPD received only 28.7 percent of the vote.
