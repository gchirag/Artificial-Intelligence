Kosovo war drawing to a close?
</H1>
An end to the Kosovo war seems to be closer at hand. Belgrade issued an
official declaration to the effect that Yugoslav president Milosevic had
agreed to the peace plan worked out by the G8-group. Earlier, the
Yugoslav parliament had agrred to the plan. It says essentially that NATO
bombing raids will stop as soon as Serbien troops retreat from Kosovo.
After that, an international peacekeeping force including NATO and
Russian troops is to be stationed in the region. Finland's president
Artthisaari and Russia's ex-premier Tschernomyrdin have been
discussing the peace plan with Milosevic in the Yugoslav capital as of
yesterday. Reportedly, both negotiators are the to travel back
- Chernomyrdin to Russia, and Artthisaari to Cologne - to present their
reports. It is not known whether Artthisaari will bring with him a document
in which Milosevic accepts a detailed peace plan. Rumors have it that
high level NATO representatives are being expected in Belgrade within
the next few days and that the air raids stop with their presence.

EU summit welcomes peace signals from Belgrade
</H1>
Britain's PM Blair said there was good news and obvious progress.
But he stressed that NATO conditions for stopping the bombing raids
were not negotiable. The news from Belgrade toppled the Cologne EU
summit meeting's schedule for today, as Finland's president Artthisaari
was expected to arrive in Cologne late this afternoon.
Still, while foreign minister Fischer said in so many words that the
information received gave reason for great hopes, defense minister
Scharping stressed that a proven retreat of Serbian troops from Kosovo
was a prime condition for stopping the NATO raids.
The Kosovo crisis was an important but not the only matter on the
summit meeting's agenda. EU chiefs of state and of government
discussed a joint European defense policy, agreeing on the need to
take a more active part in dealing with European crisis situations
in the future. The pact for employment was also approved. It contains
declarations of intent and guidelines, as on unemployed youth,
but no concrete programs for dealing with these problems.
