President Herzog meets Jiang Zemin
</H1>
On the second day of his visit to China German President Roman Herzog has
visited the oldest German-Chinese joint-venture company. The company that
exists since 1989 and was founded by Lufthansa and Air China is servicing
aircraft. During his visit of the company, which is situated near Beijing,
Herzog said the company was an example for good Chinese-German co-operation.
Afterwards, Herzog visited Beijing's Forbidden City. The complex, finished
in 1421, is part of the Imperial Palace and one of China's main landmarks.

<P>
In the afternoon, Herzog met Chinese President Jiang Zemin. Herzog said he
had made the human rights a central topic of the meeting. He had dedicated
about 20 minutes of the one-hour conversation to human rights issues and
[democratic] constitutionality. Considering the Chinese sensitivity about
this subject, Herzog did not want to state any further details in public.
However, he would pursue the topic during upcoming talks in Beijing. Herzog
indicated that during his visit a list of concrete cases would be submitted
where he advocates a humanitarian solution.
At the same time, Herzog stressed Germany's interest in close relations
with China in spite of past and, potentially even future, disturbances.

<P>
Earlier, the Chinese press had warned against a discussion of human rights.
The government newspaper China Daily wrote, otherwise, Beijing would not
support Germany's application for permanent membership in the UN Security
Council. Herzog should rather avoid sensitive issues like human rights,
Tibet, or Taiwan.

<P>
According to information from delegation sources China will receive a
low-interest loan of DM180 million from the German government. The money
will be used for alternative energies, sewage cleaning, two forestry
projects, and the improvement of a coal power plant.

Twelve years prison for aircraft hijacker Andrawes
</H1>
The Hamburg Higher Regional Court has handed down the ruling in the trial
of Souhaila Andrawes, hijacker of Lufthansa aircraft "Landshut".
In 1977, Ms. Andrawes together with three accomplices had hijacked a Boeing
aircraft with 87 passengers from Mallorca. During the hijacking, captain
Juergen Schumann (sp?) was shot dead. After an erratic route, the aircraft
was stormed in Somalia's capital Mogadishu by members of German elite
anti-terror unit GSG 9. In the action three hijackers were shot dead.
Souhaila Andrawes was the only hijacker to survive. After short
imprisonment in Somalia she went underground. She was detected in Norway in
1994 and extradited to Germany in 1995.
The Higher Regional Court sentenced the 43-year-old Palestinian to 12 years
in prison for murder, attempted murder, abduction in conjunction with
taking hostages, and encroachment of air traffic resulting in casualties.
The Court took into account the crown-witness regulation. The sentence was
in line with the prosecution's demand. Souhaila Andrawes, who had entered
the session room with a smile but shivering all over her body, asked for a
break shortly after the sentence had been pronounced. As she left the room
she fainted and collapsed. After a break, however, the reading of the
ruling could continue. While her participation in the hijacking was never
in doubt, great parts of the trial circled around the question whether she
shared responsibility for the murder of pilot Juergen Schumann. The Court
followed the view of the prosecution and found the deed to be joint murder.

Civil wars are reasons to stop expulsion
</H1>
The Federal Administrative Court in Berlin has ruled that when
asylum-seekers are expelled the danger for life and limb must be considered
for each person individually. A foreigner must not be expelled to his home
country if he is threatened by great danger from civil war. Even if a
general expulsion stop to the country in question has been lifted, the
authorities must check in each case whether the foreigner is threatened by
dangers in his home country that violate his constitutional right on
security of person. According to the Federal Administrative Court's ruling
the Bavarian Administrative Courts must reconsider the case of an Angolan
and consider the actual dangers of civil war. The Bavarian courts cannot
assume that the political decision to revoke the general expulsion stop is
applicable to all individuals.

Federal Constitutional Court rules on adjustment mandates
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe is deliberating the
constitutionality of Bundestag adjustment mandates (Ueberhangmandate) for
the 1994 general elections. The Social-Democrats have contested the
constitutionality because the mandates result in a ten-seat majority for
the government coalition instead of a two-seat majority. In the view of
Lower-Saxony, adjustment mandates violate the constitutional principle that
each vote has the same weight. At the same time, the Court also rules on
the basic-mandate clause that allowed the Socialist PDS to send 33
delegates to the Bundestag although the party received less than 5% of all
votes. [In Germany's two-vote election system -candidate and party vote-,
adjustment mandates allow a party to send all elected candidates to the
Bundestag even if the percentage of votes for the party determines a lower
number of candidates.  A party must win at least three constituencies to be
exempted from the 5% minimum clause.]

Rexrodt wants reduction of coal subsidies
</H1>
Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt wants that all subsidies for German
coal are abolished by the year 2005. Until then subsidies should be
gradually reduced. Rexrodt said literally: "We cannot afford them any
longer!"
The mining union IG Bergbau commented that Rexrodt's demand was
incomprehensible because Chancellor Helmut Kohl had already promised to
preserve coal mining. So far, the federal government is paying about DM10
billion annually to support the coal industry, North Rhine-Westphalia is
paying about DM1bn. Without subsidies from the tax payers' money all
remaining 18 German mines with more than 90,000 jobs had to close.

Bavarian physicians protest by closing practices
</H1>
Physicians in Bavaria have closed their practices in protest against a
regulation stipulating that they have to pay fines to the health insurances
for prescribing more medicaments and remedies than covered by the health
budget. The president of the Physicians District Association Rosenheim said
70 percent of the practices in that region were closed today. From today
on, the budget for medicaments and cures had been used up. Now, physicians
had to spend their own money if they want to help their patients.

No more calf transports to France
</H1>
Bavarian cattle breeders may no longer transport calves to foreign
countries to receive a premium for slaughtered and disposed animals.
After a cabinet meeting in Rosenheim, Health Minister Stamm ordered all
veterinary authorities to stop issuing international certificates for
transport of calves to France, Portugal, or Great Britain. Recently, animal
rights activists had branded that cattle breeders export thousands of
calves to cash a EU premium of DM230 for calves up to 20 days old. The
premium is not paid in Germany. Rhineland-Palatinate has followed Bavaria's
and Lower-Saxony's example.

Scharping demands more rigorous approaches against organized crime
</H1>
President of the SPD Bundestag faction Rudolf Scharping wants the
government to approach organized crime more rigorously. On Suedwestfunk
radio Scharping said, CDU/CSU and FDP continue to disagree on the
eavesdropping of gangster apartments. The SPD was in favour of surveying
criminals without condition. If necessary, the SPD would also approve
visual surveillance. Scharping criticized further the government's lack of
zest in fighting money laundering. The SPD wants that assets are seized if
they are suspected to be of criminal origin. In that case the owner must
prove the legality of the source.
