Discussion about compulsory visas for minors
</H1>
As requested by the Alliance 90/Greens party during question and answer
time, federal parliament discussed the newly introduced compulsory visas
for unaccompanied children from Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia and former
Yugoslavia. Minister Kanther defended the move, stating that "this was
to keep out the ones who had neither relatives nor family in Germany,
no education, never had been to school and did not speak the language. Their
primary objective would have been to get a foot in the door, by getting
the children into the country, and subsequently try and go for
'repatriation' of the rest of the family."

<P>
Greens member of parliament, Cem Oezdemir, said that this move would fly in
the face of people trying to boost understanding between Germans and
foreigners. And he tackled the minister asking: "Why don't you mention,
for example, that the vast majority of these children want to enter Germany
in order to meet relatives and family?"

Mr Gysi wants PDS-party to have a re-think
</H1>
Mr Gysi, head of the PDS' federal group, asked for clear signals to be set
in order to get his party into a bit of a re-think. Shortly before the
party's federal conference, Mr Gysi said, on radio Deutschlandradio Berlin,
that the PDS had to get out of the rut and isolation, and would have to
prove they were able to take an active part in politics. The delegates
should be clear about social changes being more important than personal
egos. Greasing up to the SPD was not the issue; but getting the PDS to
become an alternative party for all of Germany was

police he admitted having abused and killed the girl.

Discussion about election dates in Bavaria
</H1>
In 1998, the Free State of Bavaria will probably have different dates for
state and federal elections. Mr Glueck, head of the CSU's state
parliamentary group, refuted the SPD's claim for a common date as completely
incomprehensible. Mr Glueck wants to steer state politics clear of federal
politics. The SPD-party's initiative, allegedly, is meant to boost voter
turnout

Fresh talks about amalgamation of state radio and TV SDR and SWF
</H1>
Executives once again discussed the planned amalgamation of
state radio and television companies Sueddeutscher Rundfunk and
Suedwestfunk, agreeing to a large degree to Mr Herrmann Fuenfgeld's
discussion-paper. The future headquarter is to be in Stuttgart, whereas
programming for radio and television will be in the city of Baden-Baden.
S1 and S4 radio programmes are to be broadcast from Stuttgart, while other
radio broadcasts covering more than one state are to be broadcast from
Baden-Baden. Existing structures are to be respected, as far as possible.
State premiers Teufel (Baden-Wuerttemberg) and Beck (Rhineland/Palatinate)
will meet next week for another round of negotiations, and the two directors
of the state radio and television companies will be present as well.

DAX-index hits 3000 points
</H1>
This is the first time the German share-price index, DAX, hit
the 3,000 point mark, reaching 3001.37 points at closing time,
after having peaked at 3011 points. This means that the DAX, comprising
shares of Germany's top 30 earners, has tripled within the last decade,
though there had been some rather painful troughs in the past as well.
Brokers quote several reasons for the market's bullishness: rising business
confidence and companies' profit expectations, plus interest rates hitting
an all-time low. The US-dollar's rising above 1.60 marks today would have
been the last straw: this is excellent news for exporters, and consequently
export-oriented businesses' shares have been quite prominent among the
winners.
