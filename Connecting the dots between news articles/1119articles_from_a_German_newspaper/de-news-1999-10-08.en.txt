Industry's offer to Third Reich forced labourers not good enough
</H1>
German industry's offer to pay some 6 billion marks to workers who had been
forced to work for them during the Third Reich, triggered predominantly
critical reactions. The victims' lawyers were outraged: German industry
should not get away with paying a pittance to shed their moral guilt. They
had asked for 20 to 36 billion marks. The Central Committee of German Jews
asked Chancellor Schroeder to do his bit in the matter. The sum offered
by industry was far from being enough.

Mr Schroeder calls offer to Third Reich forced labourers 'worthy'
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder welcomed German industry's offer to forced labourers,
and called it 'worthy'. Spokesperson Heye, however, would not comment on the
question if government or business would be inclined to raise their offer
above 6 billion marks. There will be more negatotiations based on this offer
in November. German industry refuted the criticism: "it would be very
shortsighted to pillory and attack" precisely the people who volunteered to
help.

Metal Worker's Union wants pensions at 60 years of age plus 30 hours/week
</H1>
At their last Congress, the Metal Workers' Union (IG-Metall) spoke out in
favour of pensions at 60 years of age, and a vast majority of the delegates
voted for a respective remit, asking federal government to create the
required legal framework for it. After plenty of debate about a 30-hour
week (with neither pay nor staffing-levels reduced), delegates also included
that one in their catalogue of demands. At the same time they decided that
the hours worked/year should be reduced by 10%, to 1400. This should take
into account previous experience gained when reducing the hours worked/week

Mr Schroeder warns party against infighting
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder warned his party against debates about staff and
infighting. The party had to speak with one voice, and convince people that
their policies were right. He obviously referred to the attacks by former
head of the SPD Lafontaine, when he refuted his claim that his party was
shedding social-democratic values. The coalition-parties would ease the
tax-burden of small- and medium-income earners. As far as pensions were
concerned, Mr Lafontaine also attacked Mr Schroeder quite vigourously.
According to Mr Lafontaine, Mr Schroeder had claimed "full pensions at
age 60" in November 1998.

Federal Transport Minister Klimmt under investigation
</H1>
The Koblenz public prosecutor formally started an investigation of Federal
Transport Minister Klimmt. Mr Klimmt had been suspected of corruption and
aiding and abetting embezzlement, according to prosecutor Jung, who spoke on
television SWR. This in the wake of financial irregularities at soccer-club
1. FC Saarbruecken, whose president Mr Klimmt used to be. The club allegedly
received more than 600,000 marks from the former head of support agency
Caritas, via a consultancy-agreement. Mr Klimmt allegedly saved two Caritas
hospitals from cuts to their number of beds.

CSU-Party Congress: coalition's tax-plans not suitable
</H1>
At the CSU Party Congress in Nurnberg, Bavaria's State Premier Stoiber asked
to get rid of the Red-Green coalition as quickly as possible. The SPD was too
much into fixing their own problems instead of looking after society's
future, according to Mr Stoiber. Their tax-concept was totally unsuitable for
creating jobs. The planned reform was 'an accountant's dream', yet hardly the
long-overdue grandiose plan advocated by the CSU-party. On Saturday,
Mr Stoiber will run for his first re-election as head of the party
