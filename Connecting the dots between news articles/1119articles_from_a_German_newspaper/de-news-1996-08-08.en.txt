At least 63 people killed at campground catastrophe
</H1>
A minimum of 63 people have perished in the flooding of a campground in the
Spanish Pyrenees mountain chain. More than 180 persons were injured. The
police was unable to identify any of the victims so far, since most did not
carry any means of identification on them. Heavy rainfall produced an
avalanche of water, boulders, and mud, which leveled the fully occupied
campground. It washed away people, tents, and cars. Many of the 700 tourists
who stayed on the campground are still missing. The Foreign Ministry is
currently trying to obtain further information on the whereabouts of German
tourists through the German Consulate in Barcelona. The bad conditions at the
site are impeding the investigation, according to a statement issued by the
Foreign Ministry this morning which also says that no Germans are presumed to
be amongst the victims. A spokesperson of the Foreign Ministry said that this
assumption is based on the as yet unverified statements by the Spanish
police, investigating at the location. According to the police, no German
tourists were among the dead bodies identified thus far. Ultimate certainty,
however, could only be given later. Because of the general chaos at the site,
the names of many of the victims are still unknown, and a precise list of the
dead could not be compiled yet. The Spanish authorities set up an emergency
telephone line for concerned relatives. The number is +34-76-281-234.

Wage dispute in retail industry continues
</H1>
No conclusion is yet in sight for the so far longest lasting bargaining
conflict in the German retail industry. Contrary to expectations, the
agreement reached in Rhineland Palatinate has not given an example worth
copying for other wage districts. After the ninth round of negotiations in
Bavaria had been terminated prematurely, unions announced a new wave of
strikes. For a limited time, at least the stores in Bavaria had opened
punctually. The unions had not wanted to burden the upcoming ninth round
of talks. But since, against all expectations, the latter did again not
yield a result, HBV [union for trade, bank, and insurance] and DAG
[national union of employees] resorted to what they usually do in such
cases: call for strikes. Ten department stores were to be affected by the
measure in Bavaria today. The employers, too, responded yesterday to what
they consider a stalling of the negotiations by the unions' position. The
Bavarian Retail Association has advised its members to simply transfer
money to their employees' bank accounts for a retroactive wage increase of
1.85% since May 1st. 1.85% has been the last offer that the unions would
have agreed to, had there not been the problem about the extended store
hours. The bone of contention is that HBV and DAG demand bonus payment on
weekdays after 6:30pm, and on Saturdays after 2:00pm. For the employers
this is especially on Saturdays unthinkable. Future negotiations are not
scheduled yet, however, the strike schedule is fixed, according to unions.

SPD: Discussion over increase of sales tax is only a diversionary tactic
</H1>
The financial expert of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr. Voss, called the
discussion about increasing the sales tax an attempt at diversion. As Voss
emphasized this morning on Deutschlandfunk radio, one should first be
concerned with implementing the agreements from 1995. This includes an
increase of the child benefit, as well as the requirement by the Federal
Constitutional Court to exempt the minimum living wage for families with
children from taxation. Voss contended that the government is instead running
a financial policy aimed at lowering tax rates for top income levels. He said
that all groups of the population should benefit from a tax reform.

Hinze reminds industry of apprenticeship promise
</H1>
CDU Secretary General Hinze has reminded the industry to keep
their promise to provide sufficient apprenticeship positions. He said on
Suedwestfunk radio that the industry has at least a moral obligation and
should make good on their promise. Hinze said "we harm our own economic
basis if we do not continue our educational system". He called the belief,
that the creation of apprenticeship positions is not economically
beneficial to the company, a misconception. The Employers' Confederations
have demonstrated numerous times that apprentices are economically
sensible for most companies, that they do, in fact, not cost anything. In
Hinze's opinion, the industry is too sceptical in regard to the economic
development in Germany.

UNICEF demands psychological care for refugee minors
</H1>
The United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, demanded that unattended
refugee minors be attended by a children psychologist during asylum
proceedings. A study stated that during asylum proceedings, the mental burden
on refugee children is neglected. Children often suffer severe traumas during
war, escape, and persecution. Generally, authorities are not prepared to deal
with these children. UNICEF states that half of the 54 million civil war
refugees in the world are children and juveniles.
