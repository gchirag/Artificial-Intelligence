Cabinet endorses budget draft
</H1>
The cabinet has endorsed the budget drafts fro 1997 ad 1998. Finance
Minister Theo Waigel has called the drafts 'documents of a consequent
policy of consolidation'. The planned additional costs had to be coped with
without additional savings because the Bundesrat would not endorse the
saving measures.
<P>
Half of all ministries will have to do with less money next year. More
money has only been planned for pensions, interests, and the move to
Berlin. DM850 million have been scheduled for next year alone for the
construction of the controversial Eurofighter jet. The amount has
apparently been accepted by the Liberals.
<P>
The Finance Minister also defended his supplementary budget for this year.
There was no alternative to increasing the debt by DM17 billion. Further
drastic cuts were impossible to implement because of the resistance of the
SPD-lead Bundesrat. Tax increases were out of the question, too, because
they would weaken economic growth and employment.
<P>
Earlier, the cabinet had endorsed as expected the additional budget for the
current the next year. Accordingly, the amount of new debts will total
DM71.2 billion. This is clearly more than the amount of planned
investments. In this case the constitution demands that the parliament
endorses the disturbance of the economic balance at large.
<P>
For 1998 the budget plan provides government expenses totalling DM461
billion, new debts will be reduced to about DM58 billion. The medium-term
financial planning till the year 2001 provides a reduction of annual new
debts to DM47 billion. This has also been endorsed by the cabinet. The
government assumes that the number of unemployed decreases by 100,000 next
year. Theo Waigel also assumes that the total debts will be no more than
3.0 percent of the gross national product and that Germany will just make
the grade to be admitted to the Euro. In their annual economic report the
government still assumed a rate of 2.9 percent.
<P>
Oppositional politicians have criticized the government's budget plans. SPD
finance expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier called the budget drafts the
desperate attempt of the government to survive with patches and emergency
operations. Ms. Matthaeus-Maier called Finance Minister Waigel a Debt
Minister who is close to bankruptcy. According to Ms. Matthaeus-Maier the
government could save at the Transrapid high-speed train and the
Eurofighter jet.
<P>
National president of Alliance 90/Greens Ms. Roestl (sp?) stated the
government was plugging budget holes with credits that are on the verge of
unconstitionality. The government itself was responsible for the
disturbance of the economic balance at large.

Chemical accident at BASF
</H1>
A dust cloud has been released into the town of Friesenheim
from a chemical accident at BASF. A spokesman for the firm said that about
50 kg of polyethylene wax had been accidentally released, but this product
was not harmful for people or the environment and could be washed off
without problem using water. The cause of the accident was an overheated
production reactor. The chemicals were released by an emergency air release
valve and spread over the area of Friesenheim as grey fluff or dust.
Polyethylene wax is used primarily in the production of tooth paste, floor
cleaning fluid and printing inks.

Focus magazine to pay damages
</H1>
The regional court of Hamburg has ruled that the news magazine
"Focus" has to pay compensation for the collapse of the Modi Bank (sp?) of
Hamburg. According to the judgement, Focus are obliged to compensate for
all damages resulting from an article published in the magazine in January
1995. The exact amount will be established in a separate trial. Banking
experts estimate that this could amount to more than ten million marks.
Focus had promoted a report entitled "Exclusive - Hamburg private bank in
trouble; customers fear loss of money", which hadn't actually been
concerned with the bank itself, but rather with the financial situation of
its chairman of the board, Ahrend G. Modi (sp?). As a result of this
article, customers of the Modi Private Bank had withdrawn their capital
resulting in the bank eventually having to close down. When Focus has paid,
the money will be put into a compensation fund for bank depositors who have
as not yet received compensation. The legal representation for the Focus
magazine has announced that they will be appealing against the judgement.

Investigations against fiscal officer Mr. Merkle abandoned
</H1>
 The public prosecutor's office has abandoned its investigation
against the head of the tax division in the ministry of finance in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr. Merkle.  There had been indications that Mr. Merkle
had leaked confidential information related to his work at the tax office.
Today the public prosecutor's office withdrew their accusation that Mr.
Merkle had warned Mannheim concert manager Matthias Hoffmann before his
offices were searched because of suspected tax evasion.  However, the
public prosecutor's office still believes that while out drinking with his
friends in a Stuttgart pub, Mr. Merkle had shared that Mr. Hoffmann had
been apprehended.  Mr. Hoffmann was in New York City at the time, but
returned to Germany early when he received the news.  In the meantime, his
offices and his apartment had been searched by the police.  Hoffmann
himself was not apprehended until three months later, but released on bail.
The investigation against him is still underway.
<P>
The public prosecutor's office announced today that the investigation
against tax officer Mr. Merkle now had to be abandoned, since neither the
ministry of finance, nor the concert manager Mr. Hoffmann filed a suit.
The Green party in the Stuttgart state parliament was outraged today at
Finance Minister Maier-Vorfelder's decision not to sue.  Parliamentary
group leader Fritz Kuhn announced that the minister's refusal to agree to a
suit could not be tolerated.

confiscated.  Minister of the Interior Thomas Schaeuble announced that the
police were to fight fervently drug trade of any kind, especially small
trade transactions. Moreover, preventive measures, especially concerning
synthetic drugs, as well as aid programs for drug dependants were to be
expanded, added Mr. Schaeuble.

Public health insurers warn against paying visits to physicians directly
instead of through the insurer. The fee schedule allows physicians to
charge higher fees when they bill directly and more than what the insurers
reimburse.
