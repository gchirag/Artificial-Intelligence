Kosovo talks postponed until tomorrow
</H1>
Talks between top military NATO officers and representatives of the
Yugoslavian army and police regarding the retreat from Kosovo, which were
to be held in the Macedonian border town of Blace, have been postponed at
short notice until tomorrow. They will continue in the border town of
Kumanovo. There was no official statement regarding the reason for the
interruption. Serbian representatives had already driven back into Kosovo
in the afternoon several times to discuss the situation with the Belgrade
government. NATO had presented detailed plans for the Serbian retreat from
Kosovo which included exact times and retreat routes, and NATO made it
very clear that they did not intend to negotiate this with the Serbs and
that the meeting was only to clarify the details point for point to the
Serbs. NATO representatives described the atmosphere of the talks as very
professional and said that the Serbs had also presented countless plans in
the course of discussing the retreat.

Stoiber praises peace efforts in Kosovo
</H1>
Party chairman Edmund Stoiber made it clear at the CSU party conference
that reconstruction after the Kosovo war is not a German concern. He told
the approximately 240 delegates that the Federal Republic will naturally
participate in the peace plan for the region; however, he indicated that
the financial burden should be shared fairly. He also praised the latest
peace efforts in Kosovo, but he also said that these developments were
only possible due to the Union parties' loyalty to the federal government.
In his speech entitled "Bayern stark fuer Europa" [a play on words
regarding a German advertising slogan], Stoiber emphasized the importance
of the European elections on the 13th of June, since the European
parliament is continually making more decisions and has become an
important power factor in the European Union.

Eichel wants to annually increase the petrol tax by small amounts
</H1>
Federal Minister of Finance Hans Eichel wants to increase the petrol tax
annually by small amounts. The Minister said in an interview with "Bild am
Sonntag" that there are a number of European countries that annually
calculate an increase, and he feels that this is also a good idea for
Germany. This will pressure the German citizens to use energy rationally,
and the revenue will enable a reduction in the indirect wage costs. This
in turn will create jobs.

Friedrichshafen, experts are warning that walkways along the banks will
probably be flooded. The situation could probably worsen, since further
rainfall and strong winds are expected.
