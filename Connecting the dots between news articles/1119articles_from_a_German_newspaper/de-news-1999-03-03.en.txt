Federal Environment Minister, Juergen Trittin (Greens), has named a
party colleague, Wolfram Koenig, as the new president of the Federal
Radiation Protection Office. The federal cabinet today approved Trittin's
choice. Koenig was Saxony-Anhalt's Environment Minister from 1994 to 1998,

storage facility at Morsleben. The CDU called Koenig's appointment a crass
mistake and spoke of Green corruption.

Railway profits collapse
</H1>
The German Railway (Deutsche Bahn) had less turnover and less
profit in 1998 than in the previous year. While doing 30 billion DM worth
of business, the railway's profits plummeted to only 330 million DM,
versus last year's 530 million DM. The boss of the company, Johannes
Ludewig, spoke of an unusually difficult year, due in part to the
catastrophic rail accident by Eschede. He said he expected to be able to
increase turnover and profits again this year. Ludewig said that, in his
opinion, lay-offs and savings initiatives did not threaten the safety of
rail travel, as the railway engineers' union and the travellers'
association "Pro Bahn" have charged.

EU-US aircraft trade dispute
</H1>
Washington, D.C., USA. The American House of Representatives has decided
to withdraw landing rights in the United States for the British-French
supersonic aircraft, the Concorde. The ban will take effect if the EU
Ministers' Council goes ahead with its plan for a new noise pollution law
for aircraft. Under such a law, older American-made Boeing aircraft, in
particular, would no longer be allowed to land in Europe. The Americans
are accusing the European Union of trying to create a competitive
advantage for the European aircraft industry.

German killer LaGrand's execution in Arizona delayed
</H1>
Florence, Arizona, USA. The ninth (American) Federal Court of Appeal in
San Francisco has delayed the execution of German murderer Walter LaGrand.
Execution by gas chamber is cruel, and hence unconstitutional, the court
ruled. The State of Arizona plans to challenge the ruling immediately in
the Federal Supreme Court. 
<P>
The International High Court in The Hague,
Netherlands, had previously called on the United States to delay LaGrand's
execution, citing contravention of international law. The court thus
supported an application made by the German federal government. Legal
experts, however, assess the LaGrand's chances as being virtually nil. The
Governor of Arizona, Jane Dee Hull, has so far rejected all appeals for a
stay of execution.

Deaths in Dill River flooding
</H1>
The flooding Dill River in central Hesse has probably claimed
three human lives. A small rubber dinghy carrying four young men capsized
in the raging river. Once of the men could be pulled out alive, a second
was recovered already dead, and the other two have not yet been found.
Police say the dinghy was completely inadequate to the conditions.
