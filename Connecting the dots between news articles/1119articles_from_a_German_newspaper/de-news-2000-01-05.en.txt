Local FDP party congress in Stuttgart
</H1>
A day prior to the traditional high-level January summit of the federal FDP,
the Baden-Wuerttemberg arm of the party today gathered for a local party
congress in Stuttgart. The approximately 400 delegates discussed new
approaches to education policy, reform of old age pensions, and private
financing of road construction, among other topics. 
<P>
Walter Doering, head of
the FDP in Baden-Wuerttemberg, would like to see deficit spending forbidden
by the state constitution. This measure is needed, he says, because

Bernhard Wicky dies
</H1>
Actor and film director Bernhard Wicky is dead. He died in Munich at the age
of 80 from heart failure. Wicky's 1959 anti-war film "The Bridge" is world
renowned. It concerns the fate of several students, who - there being no
soldiers left - were senselessly sent to defend a bridge from American
forces in 1945. The film exerted a fundamental influence on post-war cinema
in Germany. Born in Austria, the Swiss citizen received numerous awards. The
last, the day prior to his death, was the Austrian Cross of Honor for Art
and Science, first class. State Premier Stoiber of Bavaria honored Wicky's
precision as a director, his expressiveness as an actor, and in Stoiber's
own words, "the untiring strength he brought to all his endeavors."

The public prosecutor's office has called for life imprisonment of the
defendant in the railway extortion case now being heard in Berlin. In an
attempt to extort 10 million marks from the Deutsche Bahn railway company,
the 47 year old came within a hairsbreadth of snuffing out hundreds of human
lives, they said. The man is alleged to have loosened ties on three
stretches of track, with full knowledge of the possible deaths of railway
engineers and travelers.

Crime and Punishment: Cops get stopped
</H1>
In Nuremberg, a teenager dressed as a policeman conducting an ostensible
traffic patrol wound up making the wrong stop. The 18 year old would-be
officer stopped, of all things, a police car. Dressed in a dark leather
jacket and a police cap, the young apprentice also had two blank pistols and
handcuffs in his car. The real officers assume his motive was to show off.
Preliminary proceedings have been opened against the youth on charges of
impersonating an officer.
