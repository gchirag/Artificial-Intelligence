Bundestag establishes legal footing for genetic database
</H1>
Since April, the Federal Office of Criminal Investigations has been
working to construct a genetic database.  Today, with the approval of
the CDU/CSU, SPD, and FDP, the work was placed on a legal foundation,
and the potential uses of the genetic database were expanded.  Until
now, the question was open as to when the so-called "genetic
fingerprint" of a criminal could be taken.  The Bundestag clarified
this today - genetic fingerprints can now be obtained not only in the
course of legal proceedings, but also from previously convicted
offenders.

Security strengthened to keep German vandals out of France
</H1>
After violent rioting during the World Cup Soccer Championship, French
authorities are deporting German vandals.  Several of them have been
forcibly taken to the Saarland.  The German Border Patrol (BGS),
whose presence on the French-German border was strengthened on short
notice from 130 officers to 900, will prevent those individuals from
reentering France, as well as any other vandals who set out for
tomorrow's German-Iranian game in Montpellier.  All international
trains to France are being monitored by BGS officials, and highway
border crossings are heavily manned - suspicious drivers will be
checked.  The security precautions will be continued for further
matches in France, as long as the German team is in the championship.

Reorganization of employee savings plan subsidies
</H1>
The government and the Social Democrats have reached agreement on a
reorganization of employee savings plans.  The compromise produced by
the mediation committee says the income limits for the savings plan
subsidy will be increased, to 35,000 DM for singles, and 70,000 DM for
married couples.  Additionally, there will be an extra subsidy in the
future for investing in your own employer's business.  For investments of
up to
800 DM per year, the state will match 20%, or 25% in eastern Germany.
This method of building assets will be insured against risks
such as bankruptcy.  Minister of Employment Bluem declared the results
of the negotiations in line with his expectations.  SPD politician
Schreiner said the ruling coalition has met the SPD halfway on some
important points.

Bundestag rejects demand to end the Transrapid project
</H1>
In a vote carried by the ruling coalition's majority, the Bundestag
has rejected the Greens' demand for a halt to the Transrapid project.
The Social Democrats abstained.  Minister of Transport Wissman criticized
the Opposition, saying that their candidate for Chancellor, Schroeder, had
come out in favor of pursuing construction of the maglev system, but that
the SPD faction now opposed it.  SPD
delegate Ferner said the objection is not to the technology, but
instead the route between Hamburg and Berlin that has been selected by
the government, and also the concepts for financing the project.

Vatican pushes for decision on pregnancy counseling
</H1>
The Vatican is evidently pushing for a rapid decision in the
controversy over the participation of the Catholic Church in the
national pregnancy counseling system.  According to the radio service
"Suedwestfunk," the chair of the German Bishops Conference, Lehman,
was requested by a confidential letter to submit an alternative to
past practice no later than fall.  The Prefect of the Congregation for
the Doctrine of the Faith, Cardinal Ratzinger, left no doubt that the
previous practice of issuing counseling certificates, which are
required for a legal abortion, is not compatible with the teachings of
the church.  A spokesperson for the Bishops Conference in Bonn would
only acknowledge that Lehmann has traveled to Rome to attend a
committee session.

Violent criminal caught in the vicinity of Hanau
</H1>
According to a statement, Hessian police in the vicinity of Hanau have
captured the violent criminal Buech (sp?), who has been sought
throughout Germany.  His capture came only hours after he attacked a
woman.  Buech escaped in mid-April from the Dueren state clinic in the
Rhineland, after a dental appointment.  It is strongly suspected that
shortly thereafter he murdered a man and his mother in Saxony-Anhalt,
as well as raping the man's wife and daughter.
