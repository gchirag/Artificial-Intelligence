Green Party postpones structural reform
</H1>
The Green Party has postponed it's discussion on structural reform of their
party. The proposal by Joschka Fischer and Juergen Trittin has caused
turmoil within the Green Party. Mr. Fischer and Mr. Trittin proposed to
abolish the dual leadership structure of the party and that there be one
chairperson instead who would provide a clear party line and, above all,
attract more votes. At first, this discussion monopolized their convention
completely, while the main topic, the impending European elections, was
pushed into the background, at least in the public discussion.  Antje
Radcke, spokesman for the Executive Board, demanded that her party put
political course in the foreground. She said that the debate on the
abolition of the double leadership has overshadowed the Erfurt convention
and was the wrong discussion at the wrong time. The delegates also
accepted, by a large majority, a proposition to demand shortened lives for
nuclear reactors and the discontinuation of the use of nuclear power during
the current election period. The Greens want to permit the transport of
nuclear waste only after consensus talks with industry have been
successfully completed or after a law on the abolishment of nuclear energy
has been enacted. Former Secretary General of the Green Party, Heide
Ruehle, has been voted top candidate for the European elections.

PDS and SPD
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has clarified that his rejection of
cooperation with the PDS on federal level does not refer to the Bundesrat
(Upper House). In an interview with the radio station "Deutschlandfunk",
Mr. Schroeder said that the work in the Bundesrat is with federal states,
not with parties. In the Bundestag (Lower House), however, he does not want
any cooperation with the PDS. Minister of Defense Rudolf Scharping, on the
other hand, demanded in a newspaper interview that there should not be any
cooperation between the Social Democratic Party (SPD) and PDS, even in the
Bundesrat. The Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidate for the office of
the German President, Ms. Schipanski, has revised her attitude towards the
PDS. The party plays a certain role in the present party system. In a
lively democracy, for which everyone is responsible, a party like the PDS
should be accorded its proper place, Ms. Schipanski stated.
