Investments in new military technology for Bundeswehr
</H1>
The Federal Armed Forces (Bundeswehr) will require 2 billion marks per
year for new military technology, according to Federal Defense
Minister Scharping.  This investment is necessary for the Bundeswehr
to fulfill its mission, Scharping said during a visit to an Air Force
training center on Sardinia.  Total new capital needs run at DM 20
billion over the next ten years.  Scharping pointed out that military
mobility is particularly deficient.  The Defense Minister announced
that he would present a proposal for restructuring the army by May of
next year.  This proposal will be included in budgetary plans for 2001.

Bavaria sports its own tax reform proposal
</H1>
Bavaria has presented a proposal of its own for a tax reform.  CSU
chief Stoiber wants to temporarily finance tax cuts with new debts.
Stoiber told "Bild am Sonntag" that Bavarian Finance Minister
Faltlhauser worked out a bill that would cut taxes for all taxpayers by
50 billion marks until 2003.  The total tax burden would be reduced by
one-third.  Faltlhauser said in an interview with "Der Spiegel" that he is
confident that, similar to the USA, low taxes would trigger an economic
boom so that the tax reform would be largely self-financed.

</H1>
The new pension fund model by Bavarian Minister President Stoiber
resembles long-term capital-producing saving.  Workers would make a
private contribution to the federal pension insurance system.  In a
newspaper interview, Stoiber said those who earn DM 4,000 a month
would pay DM 60 out of their own pocket into a second pension
insurance fund.  In return, workers would get a tax break.

Schroeder opposed retirement at age 60
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder is against retirement at 60.  This proposal by
IG-Metall [the union for heavy industry and electronics] is
unrealistically expensive, Schroeder said at a the SPD district party
convention in Bochum.  According to calculations, retirement at 60
would mean an increase in pension payments for the working population
of 0.4 per cent.  Schroeder urged the unions and employers to make
better use of existing possibilities for early retirement.

Investigation of Neo-Nazi gang of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
</H1>
Prosecutor General Nehm views the violent attacks on foreigners as a
threat to national safety and security in Germany.  In late August, a
gang of seven juveniles badly beat two Vietnamese, who sustained
grave injuries.  In addition, the suspects are members or sympathizers
of right-wing extremist groups who call themselves "National or Aryan
Opposition Eggesin."  The offices and apartments of these two groups
were searched by the police last night.  The raid produced writings of
national-socialistic content and racial hatred.  According to the
Prosecutor General, the suspects' objective is to instill an air of
intimidation and fear into foreigners living in Germany as well as
incite willingness to violence among the groups' peers.
