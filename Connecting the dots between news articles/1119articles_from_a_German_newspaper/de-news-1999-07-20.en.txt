July 20th, 1944, commemorated
</H1>
Berlin. Today in Berlin, the 55th anniversary of the failed
assassination attempt on Adolf Hitler on July 20th, 1944, is being
commemorated. The Mayor of Berlin said that the attempt had not been in
vain despite its failure. At the government's official celebration
ceremony, Minister of  Defense Scharping  emphasized that the resistance
had led directly to the creation of the Federal Republic. The President
of the German Parliament Rau laid a wreath to commemorate the victims of
National-Socialism.

<P>
On the evening in question 430 armed forces recruits took a public vow
at the German resistance memorial in Bendler-Block. That was where
Hitler's attempted assassins led by Colonel Graf Stauffenberg were
executed after the attempt failed. In his speech Chancellor Schroeder
said that the armed forces were a peace force committed to protecting
Human Rights. The war in Kosovo proved this.
In spite of extreme security precautions, a number of demonstrators
succeeded in disturbing the public vow. With slogans written on
umbrellas, they demanded the disbandment of the armed forces.
Approximately ten protesters, numbering at least two half-naked women,
approached the recruits who were preparing for the ceremony. The
protesters were led away by the police. Defence minister Scharping said
on national television that the protests had almost ended in a more
comical fashion. It is something for people to smile about.

Minister of Economics Mueller presents economic report
</H1>
The Minister of Economics Mueller has received support after
presenting his first economic report. The business associations demanded
the report be used as a guide line for the government. The trade unions
criticized the report however, since it places the responsibility for
economy and employment exclusively on the trade unions. In his report
Mueller calls on businesses and citizens to lower their claims on the
state. That being crucial to ensure long-term growth and employment.
Mueller demands that the unions and management align their wage
agreements with the improvement of productivity in order to contribute
to the decrease of unemployment. For the present year Mueller counts on
a economic growth of just under two percent. Mueller says he is hoping
for a small economic revival and counts on a growth of 2.5 percent or
somewhat more the coming year.

economics minister Doering to ensure a balanced budget starting 2006. In a
newspaper interview, Doering had demanded an end to new loans and a tight
budget. Mr. Teufel stressed, a balanced budget could be a target only when
