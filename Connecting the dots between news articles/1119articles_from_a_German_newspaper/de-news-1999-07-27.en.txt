Acquittal for Johannes Zwick
</H1>
In the second trial related to the greatest Bavarian tax scandal, the
Regional Court in Hof has acquitted 43-year-old Johannes Zwick today. The
court was convinced that the son of "King of Spas" Eduard Zwick did not
help his father in evading taxes in the million mark range. Johannes Zwick
will be compensated for the four months he has spent in investigation
custody. In 1990 the Bavarian Ministry of Finances had squashed Eduard
Zwick's taxes of 71 million marks after a payment of 8.3 million marks. In
the first trial, Zwick had been sentenced to pay a fine of 1.6 million DM
and a probationary term. This sentence was revoked by the Federal High
Court.

<P>
This, however, is not the end of the proceedings, yet. The Prosecution
announced that it will appeal today's ruling. Further, the Bavarian Finance
Ministry still demands 50 million marks in late-payment charges and
interest from the heirs of Eduard Zwick.

<P>
The Bavarian opposition regards the acquittal of Johannes Zwick as a
penalty for the government's buddy-economy. SPD secretary-general Hoderlein
said the ruling was a slap in the face of the CSU government, especially
for the responsible finance ministers. Their failure to collect Eduard
Zwick's taxes had cost the Bavarian tax payer millions of marks. The tax
expert of Buendnis90/Gruene Ms. Kellner said, the state premier would now
have to admit publicly to a Straussian buddy economy [referring to the late
State Premier Franz-Josef Strauss who was good friend with industrialists
and liked to return favours]. The Stoiber government, too, had not exactly
covered itself with glory in dealing with the Zwick affair.

Increase of sickness rate in German companies
</H1>
The number of ill employees has increased again significantly in
the first half of this year. The Ministry for Health attributes the
increase to the influenza wave this spring. The daily Die Welt quotes a
statistic by the Health Ministry showing that 6.2% more employees were ill
in the first half of 1999 than in the first half of 1998. The increase of
the sickness rate was strongest in June. German industrial associations,
however, attribute the increase of missed work time to the reintroduction
of full sick-pay. The president of the Federal Association of German
Industry Olaf Henkel said in an interview with Die Welt that this would
cost companies and employees [who both contribute to the health programme]
3 billion marks additionally. In contrast, the reduced sick-pay had
relieved the companies by 12 billion marks compared to 1995.

DAG prepares for longer opening hours for shops
</H1>
The national employee union (DAG) is preparing for the
introduction of longer opening hours for shops.  In an interview, the
deputy DAG-chairman Gartz said that he considers it a mistake to implement
the new law on opening hours in the fall. Should longer opening hours be
introduced, new working hours systems, higher premiums and job security
measures should be negotiated. An iniatitive suggested to parliament by
Berlin, proposes allowing opening hours from 06:00 to 22:00 on Monday
through Saturday. Other states too are supporting the relaxation of opening
hours.

Tax on manufacturer through second-hand car law significantly lower
</H1>
The tax on German car manufacturers through the EU-guidelines on
the disposal of second cars, has turned out to be significantly lower than
feared by the industry. The 'Berliner Zeitung' reports, referring to
internal calculations made by the government,  that the businesses simply
have to lay on reserves of 5 billion DM. The automobile industry union,
however, had calculated the reserve requirements at 25 billion DM.
Consequently, in government circles, the protests by the businesses against
the second-hand car law are seen as rather excessive.

Scientists question usefulness of planned summer smog speed limits
</H1>
 The speed limits planned by the government to reduce summer
smog are now also being questioned by scientists. Karlsruhe's climatologist
Fiedler says that research has shown that short term speed limits only
slightly decrease the ozone level. The planned new summer smog measures
will therefore have little effect. According to Fiedler, a significant
reduction of the smog can only be achieved by the systematic installation
of catalytic converters.

Losses in turnover and profit at German Telekom
</H1>
According to a report in the "Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung", both turnover and profit at the German Telekom have fallen by
approximately 20 percent in the first half year of 1999. According to the
FAZ, this information came from company circles. A representative for
Telekom would not comment on the story and referred to the public
announcement of the temporary figures coming Thursday. The FAZ also
reported that apparently Telekom has not succeeded in balancing the losses
in turnover caused by lower rates. Since Telekom again significantly
lowered its rates on July 1st, experts assumed that, over the entire year
of 1999, losses in turnover and returns must be expected.
