Start of CDU election campaign
</H1>
The Christian Democratic Party (CDU) entered into the hot phase
of the election campaign today [Sunday] with its traditional mass rally
at the "Westfalenhalle" in Dortmund.  Approximately 18,000 people were
expected to attend. All the important figures of the Union participated
in the event five weeks before the general election. Speeches were held
by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the Union's Parliamentary Party Leader
Wolfgang Schaeuble, CSU Chairman Theo Waigel, Minister of the Environment
Angela Merkel and Minister of Labor Norbert Bluem. Even two long-time
adversaries of Chancellor Kohl were allowed to speak; Saxony's State
Premier Kurt Biedenkopf and the President of the Jenoptik concern, Lothar
Spaeth, who is earmarked to be the Chancellor's advisor.

<P>
Chancellor Kohl called on listeners to do whatever possible to avoid a
red-green coalition as he did does not think that the Social Democrats
(SPD) and the Green Party were capable of making the right decisions for
Germany's future. The Chancellor commented on the SPD's 100 day program
saying that "This is not a start program, but rather a stop program". At
the same time he confirmed his rejection of a grand coalition.

<P>
Yesterday, the SPD had initiated the hot phase of its election campaign.
Candidate for the Chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder and other leading
Social Democrats made appearances at rallies in Berlin, Munich and Bonn.

Schroeder criticizes Kohl's rejection of grand coalition
</H1>
According to SPD candidate for the Chancellorship Gerhard
Schroeder, the Chairmen of CDU and CSU, Helmut Kohl and Theo Waigel, will
not be able to hold to their absolute rejection of a possible grand
coalition. Mr. Schroeder said in an interview that the two will have to
forget their stand if a grand coalition turns out to be the only option
after the elections. Mr. Kohl and Mr. Waigel had reaffirmed yesterday
that they are not willing to enter into a grand coalition with the SPD.
Contrary to that, former State Premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg Lothar
Spaeth who is earmarked as advisor to Mr. Kohl in the case of an election
victory of the CDU does not forsee any problem with a grand coalition.

Traffickers have built up a structured organized crime network
</H1>
According to Manfred Kanther, Minister of the Interior, gangs
smuggling illegal immigrants into Germany have built up a structured
network of organized crime. Mr. Kanther reported that gangs from the Far
East in particular are active in Germany. These gangs do not just limit
their activity to border areas alone, but have extended smuggling right
into the interior of the country. Mr. Kanther said that compassion is
misplaced in the fight against this kind of criminal activity. He
confirmed that he is not in favor of instituting an immigration law in
Germany as he did not think that the country needs immigration, and
furthermore, he did not think that such legislation would solve any
problems.
