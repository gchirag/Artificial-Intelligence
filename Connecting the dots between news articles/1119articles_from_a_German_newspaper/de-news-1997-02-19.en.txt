Freight train accident in Frankfurt
</H1>
Two freight trains collided in Frankfurt's south train station
last night. A tank car filled with 85 tonnes of gasoline tipped over and
caught fire. Two other rail cars, also full of gasoline, also left the
tracks and tipped over. Between midnight and 4 o'clock this morning there
were approximately 200 firefighters from Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Hanau, and
Offenbach fighting the blaze together. The surrounding buildings had to be
evacuated. A greater catastrophe was avoided, however, as the gas station
within sight of the scene of the accident remained unaffected by the
conflagration. Nevertheless, the alarm could only be stilled after the
rail cars were salvaged, which took until evening. According to an interim
assessment by the fire department at midday, there were three firemen
injured, as well as one person slightly injured in the evacuation. The
cause of the accident is not yet known.

Kinkel continues political talks in Moscow
</H1>
Following Foreign Affairs Minister Klaus Kinkel's visit in Moscow,
there is still no breakthrough in sight in the dispute over the eastward
expansion of NATO. In a telephone conversation, Russian President Yeltsin
again rejected an expansion of the military alliance. Russian Prime
Minister Chernomyrdin and Defence Minister Rodyonov (sp?) echoed that
sentiment. Russia's leaders are demanding an agreement with NATO about
security guarantees. The new American Foreign Minister, Albright, is
expected in Moscow tomorrow for her maiden visit. She has suggested the
creation of a common brigade composed of Russian units and NATO troops.

"Stasi/RAF Connection" trial begins in Berlin
</H1>
The admission of 10 former RAF terrorists into East Germany in the
early 80s had been agreed upon by the governments in West and East
Germany, according to the testimony of a former Stasi officer. The former
director of the Stasi terror defence department, Dahl (sp?), said at the
opening of the trial against him at the Regional Court in Berlin that
there was an understanding between the governments in Bonn and East Berlin
at that time. Dahl did allow, however, that his testimony was based on a
subjective assessment of statements made by his bosses. The West German
government had also supposedly been informed of the terrorists'
whereabouts by the American secret service. Dahl and three other former
Stasi officers are facing trials for the admission of 10 members of the
RAF into East Germany. They are charged with obstruction of justice
because they hid the terrorists until June 1990. The accused denied the
charges and emphasized that they strictly adhered to East German law.

Federal cabinet agrees on changes to transition payments
</H1>
The federal cabinet has come to an agreement on tougher regulations
governing transition payments due to departing government members. Income
from subsequent employment will in future be deducted from the transition
payments. Because of legal considerations, however, the new rule will not
be applied retroactively. The Ministry for Internal Affairs is to prepare
a bill based on this agreement. Until now, cabinet members have continued
to receive their full wages for 3 months after leaving their positions,
and then half wages for a further 33 months. These transition payments
came to be in the news and under fire again because parliamentary state
secretary Cornelia Yzer had taken a well-paid position with a
pharmaceutical group and was still eligible for approximately 180,000
marks in transition payments. Yzer, as well as former parliamentary state
secretary and now vice-president of the Bundestag, Michaela Geiger, have
meanwhile announced that they would not claim any of the transition money.

Federal cabinet approves permanent decree for cattle cull
</H1>
The federal cabinet has approved a permanent decree to replace the
provisional emergency one providing for the killing of suspect cattle.
Agriculture Minister Borchert hopes that the move will ensure uniformity
in the federal states' execution of his order to destroy the approximately
5,200 cows imported into Germany from Britain and Switzerland, because of
the threat of mad cow disease. The emergency decree had been rejected by a
series of courts as invalid, causing several state governments to abort
the culling. In some states, cows have been destroyed only with the
owners' permission. In others, the culling is well under way. Thus,
Borchert's emergency decree was full of holes, and due to be replaced.

federal cabinet in Bonn. The report indicates that approximately 2.4
million vertebrates were used in experiments in 1991; 1.6 million in 1995.

Federal Fiscal Court: taxation of interest not unconstitutional
</H1>
The taxation of income from interest payments, in place since
1993, is not unconstitutional. That ruling was announced today by the
Federal Fiscal Court. The tax revision through the Interest Deduction Law
of 1992 is not open to any concerns that could lead to
unconstitutionality, at least for the calendar year 1993, said the supreme
court in Germany for fiscal matters. The ruling thus rejected the appeal
of a couple against the judgement of the state fiscal court in Munich. The
plaintiffs hoped to have the legal question presented to the Federal
Constitutional Court; the judges found that to be unnecessary. A spokesman
for the Federal Finance Ministry has indicated approval of the decision,
saying it confirmed the government's view. The Bavarian Finance Minister,
Huber, commented that the Federal Fiscal Court had obviously recognized
the government's efforts to create uniformity in the taxation of interest
payments. The taxation of interest experienced a change in regulation in
Germany in 1993 after the Federal Constitutional Court had ascertained
that the tax was not being levied uniformly and was not sufficiently
verifiable. The appeal which the Federal Fiscal Court has just rejected as
groundless was based on the argument that the new rules had also failed to
create uniformity.

Refusal to work okay in buildings with too much asbestos
</H1>
In the legal dispute over asbestos levels at its broadcast
centre in Cologne, the broadcaster Deutsche Welle has lost its case, with
no possibility of appeal, at the Federal Labour Court. The court, in
Kassel, granted an engineer the right to refuse to work in asbestos-laden
areas, while still receiving full pay. The ruling is valid where certain
legal asbestos limits are exceeded in areas where work is normally done
without protective gear. This decision applies to about 150 employees in
the building, who had also sued the company. The Deutsche Welle high-rise
contains about 500 tonnes of asbestos, according to union figures.

Stamm: no increase in health insurance premiums for employees alone!
</H1>
Bavarian Social Minister Barbara Stamm rejects the idea of
increasing health insurance premiums for employees but not their
employers. She said "As far as I am concerned, that is out of the
question". At the same time, she warned Federal Health Minister Seehofer
against following the FDP. According to Stamm, premium hikes only on the
backs of workers would have serious consequences for the entire social
security system. She adds that a political decision like that would also
be a declaration of war against the unions.

SPD: fight against unemployment central to tax reform
</H1>
The SPD say that their primary concern in the coming negotiations with the
federal government over tax reform, which begin next week, is the fight
against unemployment. The party's secretary-general, Muentefehring (sp?),
said today on Deutschlandfunk radio that they wanted to shorten the
process of consensus-building so that taxes could be lowered as early as
1998. He said that a reduction of 1 percent would lead to more than
100,000 new jobs. Concerning the question of pension reform, Muentefehring
warned against haste. He said that the established social security system
could remain in force if unemployment were fought and all work were
subject to unemployment insurance deductions.

trend in construction is continuing, and that private consumption is being

Markets cool about coming monetary union
</H1>
According to the director of the German Economic Institute, Fels,
financial markets are much cooler about the planned introduction of the
common European currency, the euro, than the general population, so far.
Speaking to Deutschlandfunk radio this morning, Fels emphasized that
businesses were coming to the realization that the common currency would
lend Europe more stability and a secure framework for wage policies. He
said that a punctual beginning of monetary union in 1999 was probable,
even if only the criteria for inflation, interest, and exchange rates were
largely fulfilled so far; now the European governments would have to get
on top of the budgetary criteria.

Spanish truckers' strike: production stoppages in auto industry

The strike of Spanish long-distance truck drivers, which

European auto industry. Approximately 25,000 have been affected in
Germany. At Volkswagen and Opel, many production lines are still because
parts from Spain are unavailable. The Opel plant in Bochum is now not
producing anything. General Motors' plant in Hungary has had to cease
operation. Opel and Ford closed facilities in Portugal. Stoppages were
reported at two Mercedes plants in Spain. Some other facilities in Spain
have been able to resume partial operation, however.

Heavy snowfall, surface ice, and strong winds made driving
difficult in much of Germany last night, and brought traffic to a
stand-still in some areas. Above 300 m above sea-level, snow completely
covered many areas. In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, there were at least
30 accidents, with several people injured. Autobahn A8 between Stuttgart
and Munich had to be close for several hours by Guenzburg. In the
south-west, police reported heavy snowfall with visibility of less than 50
m. Truck drivers transporting dangerous goods were instructed to seek out
the nearest parking areas to stop in.
