Federal and state governments want to speed up refugee repatriation
</H1>
Both the federal and state governments are offering subsidies to
Kosovo
refugees in Germany who volunteer for their repatriation at the
earliest
possible date. After a Bonn meeting of minister for internal affairs
Schily
with his state counterparts, the minister said that this could not
take place
before the situation in Kosovo was stabilized. For this reason,
Germany
was participating in the planned 3,000 man international police force
with a contingent of 210 police officers.
Roughly 15,000 refugees found shelter in Germany during the Kosovo
war. Their repatriation was not the main problem, Schily said. Rather
more complicated was the situation of some 180,000 Kosovo ethnic
Albanians who have been living in Germany for a longer time but are
due to return. Their repatriation would probably not be possible
before
the spring of 2000.

</H1>
Leading Green politicians have come out in favor of a platform
debate within the party, but also called on members to remain
united. Ms. Radke, spokeswoman for the national leadership, said
it must now be established in which direction the party was moving.

getting rid of leftist members. On the other hand, national manager
Buettighofer and faction leader Schlauch said it was quite in order
to use the document for initiating a platform debate within the
Green party.
The row was cuased by a list of demands issued by 40 junior party
functionaries which constituted hard criticism of the party's
political
direction. he document states that there is a crisis within the party,
mainly caused by the founding generation that came out of the '68
movement. In the future, the Greens would have to challenge the FDP's
liberal policy.
