Green conference of federally elected delegates
</H1>
Meeting in Erfurt, the Greens began their conference of federally
elected delegates with a debate over internal party reforms.  At the
center of the debate is the controversial double-chairpersonship of the
party.  One of the party spokespeople, Gunda Roestel, while conceding
the necessity of reforms, gave a clear thumbs down to an abolition of
the double chair; Instead, she called for a renovation.  Roestel thus
led off the conference pronouncing herself in opposition to Joschka
Fischer's proposal, which foresees only one party chair in the future.
Many other prominent Greens are nevertheless for the abolition of the
double chair.  Foreign Minister Fischer called on his party comrades to
candidly examine the causes of the recent electoral defeat.  In
addition, he said the rank and file party members have to learn what it
means to govern. He said the party has to learn how to strike a balance
between ideas for the future and that which is feasible.  However, he
denied reports that he wanted the party chairmanship for himself and
dismissed them  as  nonsense.

CSU stands behind Ingo Friedrich for the European parliament
</H1>
The CSU wants to use the European elections as a platform for a
referendum on the red/green coalition in Bonn.  Thus announced party
chairman Edmund Stoiber at a meeting of delegates in the Swabian town of
Gersthof.  The delegates finalized the party list for the June 13th
election.  At the top of the list once again is Ingo Friedrich, head of
the current party delegation. The delegates elected Friedrich, a Middle
Franconian, who has had a seat in the European parliament for 20 years,
with 95% of the vote.  Party chairman Stoiber recommended Friedrich, and
declared that 50+% was the party's goal for the election.  With such a
result the CSU could up the number of their delegation in Strassburg
from 8 to 9.  Stoiber demanded that at least a third of the new
candidates should be women.  Accordingly, the delegates nominated women
for positions 2 through 4: Ursula Schleicher,  Vice-President of the
European Parliaments, and newcomers Angelika Niebler and Emilia Mueller.
Men were elected for positions 5 through 9.  At the beginning of the
nomination process, Stoiber described the European elections as a vote
of judgment on the Socialists.  He described the European policies of
the government as amateurish and stated that Finance Minister Lafontaine
was the one driving macro-economic policy into a brick wall.  He also
said Lafontaine was the one who had to answer for the recent weakening
of the Euro.

Schroeder before him a few days ago, rejected cooperation with the PDS
at the federal level.

Ministry of Defense denies poor condition of tanks in Kosovo
</H1>
The Federal Ministry of Defense has rejected a report by "Der Spiegel,"
which states that Bundeswehr tanks being deployed in Kosovo are in poor
condition.  The report speculated the Bundeswehr may lose  face because
the tanks are prone to breakdowns.  Although a Bundeswehr spokesman
conceded that there are bottlenecks in the supply of spare parts, he
said that these problems do not affect the equipment's combat-readiness.

Calls for more independence from the Vatican
</H1>
The CDU politician Ms. Schavan has demanded that German Catholic bishops
become more independent of the Vatican.  Ms. Schavan is vice president
of the Central Committee of German Catholics.  She told the news
magazine "Der Spiegel" that the Church must not exclusively look to Rome
for guidance.  A withdrawal of the Catholic Church as one of the sources
offering government-mandated pregnancy counseling would be a heavy
burden for all German Catholics.  Not only the Pope but the counselors,
too, have a conscience, Ms. Schavan said.

persecution target exclusively women.  Mass rape in Bosnia always leads
to wide-spread public indignation, yet, under current rules, rape is not
considered a suitable reason for requesting asylum in Germany .
