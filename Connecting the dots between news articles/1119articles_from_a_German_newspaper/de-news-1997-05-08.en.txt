Herzog receives "Karlspreis" of Aachen
</H1>
President Herzog has been awarded the international "Karlspreis" of the
city of Aachen in recognition of his contribution to the unification of
Europe.  King Juan Carlos of Spain praised Mr. Herzog as an advocate of
dialogue between the cultures.  He urged critics to drop reservations about
an expansion of the European Union.  In his vote of thanks, Mr. Herzog, too,
took up this point.  He said the process towards European unification must
be kept in motion and be freed from periodically occuring stagnation.  At
the present time, security interests, the protection of assets and fears
of a reduction in the standard of living have displaced the willingness
to take risks, the President added.  He cautioned against viewing the
unification of Europe as a purely economic task.  Europe is more than
just an economic market with a future joint currency.  The President
called for a return to a culture of freedom as the spiritual foundation
of Europe.  Mr. Herzog is the third German President to receive this
award, besides Walter Scheel and Karl Carstens before him.  The prize of
DM 5000 has been awarded since 1950 to individuals who have made an
outstanding contribution to the unification of Europe.

Discontent over arbitration ruling in construction industry
</H1>
The professional association for workers of the construction industry in
Berlin and Brandenburg has rejected the agreement put forward by the
arbitration committee.  According to the association, the ruling is
unrealistic.  The employers and unions of the construction industry also
appear to be dissatisfied with the outcome reached by their negotiators
and the mediator, Mr. Geissler.

<P>
The union IG Bau and the employers are equally disappointed with the new
regulations for sick-pay.  If the bargaining commission of employers and
unions rejects the mediator's ruling within the next 14 days, there could
still be strikes in the construction industry.

Conflicting evaluations of railway-reform
</H1>
Tax payers have been saved some 20 billion Marks by the railway-reform,
according to the chairman of Deutsche Bahn [German Rail], Mr. Birr.  Birr
told a Leipzig newspaper that before the reform, the railway company
spent around 36 billion Marks more in 1993 than they earned.  Now the
company is making a profit.  Back in March the Federal Auditor-General's
Office, however, expressed criticism about the reform.  In an evaluation
statement the office said that the transformation of the German Railway
into a publicly traded corporation had not lived up to its expectations.
The expected corporate success was yet to materialize.
