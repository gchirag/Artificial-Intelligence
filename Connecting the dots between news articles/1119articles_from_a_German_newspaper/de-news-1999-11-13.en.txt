</H1>
 Close to 70 German Red Cross emergency medical personnel have
arrived in Turkey.  In addition, they've brought dogs, tents and medical
supplies.  According to the latest reports, 321 people have died in the
Duezce earthquake and more than 1800 people have been injured. Because of
freezing weather conditions, the chances of survival for people trapped
under rubble are slim.  Aid workers are racing against time trying to
remove the remains of caved-in buildings. Many phone lines are dead.  The
population of Istanbul and Ankara has been urged to give blood. This is
the second massive earthquake in Turkey this year.  17,000 people died in
the quake in August.

 Chancellor Schroeder defended himself against accusations that
his policies are too industry-friendly.  There is no shame in having good
relations with industry, even for a social-democrat, Schroeder said at an
SPD convention in Cologne.  He urged his party to show more solidarity and
to stop intra-party attacks.  Once the SPD recovers its unity, it will
stand up to the challenges of the future, he said.
