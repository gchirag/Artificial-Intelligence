Cold weather to stay until New Year's Eve
</H1>
Vast stretches of Europe will remain under the influence of cold
winter-weather, and Met-service forecasters predict that it will stay very
cold for another week. They also expect snow-falls. Currently the lowest
night-time temperatures are around the -20 degrees Celsius mark, in Bavaria.

<P>
There were reports of damages by frozen water-pipes, causing, for example,
about a million marks worth of damage to the Baden-Wuerttemberg Ministry of
Revenue's offices.

Mr Hentsch tells EU-members they have neglected employment-policies
</H1>
The outgoing president of the EU-parliament, Mr Hentsch, told
the heads of states of the EU member-countries that they had neglected
employment-policies. Mr Hentsch, a SPD-politician, said in an interview
with Radio Bremen, that so far they had paid too little attention to the
future of work. New forms of distribution of work were called for. And
education potentials should be put to better use. Mr Hentsch will retire
from his current job at the end of January.

Drug-gang cracked in Heilbronn
</H1>
After several months of investigations, the Heilbronn narcotics
squad cracked a drug-gang, arrested twelve alleged drug dealers and
impounded 19 kilogrammes of cocaine. According to the authorities, a
28-year old student, a 30-year old son of a company-owner and a criminal who
had escaped from jail were alleged to have pulled the wires. They had
established contacts with a Brasilian drug cartel, and tried to smuggle the
drugs to Freiburg, Heilbronn and Hanover.

Unions: more part-time work, less overtime
</H1>
Mr Schulte, head of the German Council of Trade Unions, asked
for less overtime, more part-time work and a levy for education/training. In
an interview with the German press agency dpa, Mr Schulte said that German
employers would be able to create several 100,000 jobs if they agreed to
cut down on overtime, and it was a disgrace if they did not take up the
chance to do so.  And more part-time work was needed as well. Employers,
however, would not want to know about new concepts as far as working-hours
were concerned. Mr Schulte also reminded employers that they should offer
more apprenticeships.

Rentpayers' Association: above-average rise of rents
</H1>
The German Rentpayers' Association is afraid there will be an
above-average rise in rents next year. Their director, Mr Rips, said in a
newspaper-interview that he would expect more than a third of all households
to spend more than 35% of their incomes on rent. Rising rents and very
hefty increases in fees collected by the towns and cities were to blame.
He would expect the cost of renting to rise at least twice as fast as
'ordinary' inflation.

Taxpayers' Union: Pay tax if you are a German national
</H1>
The German Taxpayers' Union proposed to have the decision if a person
should pay tax, depend on their nationality, according to spokes-person
Mr Ondratschek. Well-heeled German nationals then would be unable to escape
the tax-man by taking up residence outside Germany. Although there would be
more paperwork involved, the revenue office should do it, to be fair to all.

frozen in Switzerland, had been transferred to the receiver, enabling the
above pay-out.

More and more fireworks get imported
</H1>
Germany is importing more and more and more fireworks:
according to the Federal Department of Statistics, last year's imports were
in excess of 23,000 (metric) tons, the bulk originating from China.

<P>
Before the current year is out, organisations supporting the hungry,
children and animals appealed to people to spend less on fireworks this
New Year's Eve. Their motto, "bread instead of bangers" (Brot anstatt
Boeller), is not meant to be a wet blanket; it should, however, be food for
thought, and make people wonder if they should not donate part of their
money to projects in under-developed countries.
