Unemployment rate still at a record high in Germany
</H1>
The unemployment rate in Germany remains at a record high.
According
to the Federal Labour Office, 4.35 million people were registered as
unemployed
in April, 130,000 less than in March. The unemployment rate went down from
11.7% to 11.3%. However, compared to April last year, the number of
unemployed
people increased by 380,000.

<P>
President of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said the economic
growth
was still too weak to turn around the trend on the labour market. The
shortage
of apprenticeships continues to be serious.

<P>
The government commented on the April figures as being a good sign and giving
hope for improvement in the labour market situation.
Social Democrats and the national trade union federation called the new
figures
an alarming sign and accused the government of inactivity.

Coalition government formally offers SPD negotiations over pension reform
</H1>
The governing coalition has formally offered the Social Democrats
negotiations of the planned pension reform. Employment Minister Norbert Bluem
said after exploratory talks with the SPD, the basis of the negotiations
should be the reform proposals of the two parties. It was important to ease
the financial burden of pension schemes by payment cuts and budgetary
rearrangements. SPD social expert Rudolf Dressler said today's meeting didn't
bring any new results to this respect. The only progress was that now the
SPD proposal will be discussed.

Kiel teachers protest against region's educational policies
</H1>
Teachers' associations and unions protested against the educational
policies of Schleswig-Holstein's state government this afternoon.
They criticise in particular the controversial plans for securing
a sufficient teaching level in the long term. This would include more
work for older teachers and merging classes. The Education Minister,
Ms Birk (sp?), has defended the plans again since for the first time
it would be possible to plan the teaching level on a long-term basis.
She added that the increase in the work load of the teachers was
unavoidable.

State Interior Ministers will not accompany Kinkel to Bosnia
</H1>
The State Interior Ministers will, contrary to earlier plans,
not accompany Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on his visit to Bosnia.
Almost all invited Interior Ministers canceled the trip. It was
planned that the Minister would inform themselves in Sarajevo on
Thursday about the facilities for returning war refugees. Interior
Minister of Bavaria Rudolf Beckstein and his colleague in Lower
Saxony, Mr Glogowski, said the trip would be useless if Federal
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther was not taking part. Also, just
a one-day trip will not yield any new findings. Mr Kinkel has
criticised several times the deportation of Bosnian refugees
from Germany.

Bremen's mayor calls for closedness in SPD
</H1>
Social-democratic mayor of Bremen Henning Scherf has called on
his party to show closedness on the time schedule of the nomination
of their candidate for the next general elections. Mr Scherf said on
Deutschlandfunk radio the proposed date next spring looked perfectly
right to him. State Premier Gerhard Schroeder still had to prove
that he could again win the elections in Lower Saxony [later this
year]. The Bremen mayor also warned his fellow party members not to
guide themselves by the success of the British Social Democrats, and
not to - as he put it - "talk the SPD into confusion". Instead it was
necessary to concentrate on important challenges like the tax and the
pension reform.

Banks must credit transfers the day they receive the money
</H1>
Banks have to credit transfers to their customers' accounts
on the day they receive them, according to a decision
of the Federal High Court in Karlsruhe. The judges ruled illegal
the procedure of a bank that always credited incoming transfers
one day later than it actually received them. According
to the judges, this praxis disadavantages the customers too much.
The Federal High Court, however, approved the delayed crediting
of cheques.
