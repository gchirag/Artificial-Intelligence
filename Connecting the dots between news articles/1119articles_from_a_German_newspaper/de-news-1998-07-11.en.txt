Kinkel arrives in Moscow to discuss Kosovo crisis
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel has arrived in Moscow to consult with his
Russian counterpart Primakov on the Kosovo crisis.  He briefed Primakov on
his latest visit to the region.  Prior to the meeting, Kinkel said he
intended to obtain Russia's consent for a military intervention in the
conflict, if necessary even over the objections of Yugoslavia.  Kinkel
suggested that Moscow should use its leverage over Belgrade to effect a
cease fire and to reopen a dialogue between the warring parties.  Russia,
however, continues to oppose a military NATO intervention in Kosovo and is
insisting on a diplomatic solution. Nonetheless, Kinkel has reported that
new proposals for defusing the conflict are being discussed.  These have
to be considered by the other western allies, and Kinkel did not give any
details.  Despite all efforts to restore peace in the region, the fighting
continues.
