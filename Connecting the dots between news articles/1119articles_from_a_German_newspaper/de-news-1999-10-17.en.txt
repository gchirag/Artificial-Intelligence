Small party conference for the Greens
</H1>
The Green party conference has decided that the party's traditional
separation of office and mandate (which means that a member cannot hold a
leadership position while acting as the direct representative for a set of
constituents, or vice-versa) will be partially lifted. In the future,
elected representatives or government members will be able to belong to the
party's federal executive. A final decision on the issue can only be made at
the general party conference in Karlsruhe in March, with a two-thirds
majority vote. The committee of state-level Green party administrations
(Laenderrat) in Magdeburg also agreed to replace the Party Council
(Parteirat) with a sixteen-member Presidential Committee (Praesidium), and
to enlarge the Federal Executive from five to six members. At present, the
Party Council has twenty-five members. The Greens hope the new committee
will be more effective.
Participants at the conference called for an immediate end to the war in
Chechenya. They also want the European Union to look into applying sanctions
against Russia.

Ruettgers says cooperation with Greens conceivable
</H1>
According to the deputy caucus leader for the CDU/CSU, Juergen Ruettgers,
the prospect of forming state governments in coalition with the Greens is no
longer a taboo topic. Ruettgers told the "Welt am Sonntag" newspaper that
cooperation was a possibility even outside of municipal politics. For his
own state of North Rhine-Westphalia, where he is head of the CDU, however,
Ruettgers ruled out the possibility of such a coalition following the next
state elections there in May.

CDU to emphasize its differences from PDS
</H1>
CDU leader Wolfgang Schaeuble and party Secretary-General Angela Merkel have
joined in  with the demands of other important CDU politicians that the
party discuss matters of policy with the PDS in order to emphasize their
differences. The leader of the "Young Union" youth wing of the party,
Hildegard Mueller, supports the move as well, saying, at the Young Union's
national conference, that the PDS phenomenon could only be fought if other
parties differentiated their positions clearly, and offered young Germans
different perspectives.
An executive member of the PDS, Michael Schumann, welcomed the announcement
of policy discussions. He told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper that that
would allow an opportunity to raise the subject of the real problems facing
Germany.

Legal status of homosexual partnerships
</H1>
The executive of the Young Union (JU), the youth wing of the CDU/CSU, has
failed in its attempt to secure improved legal status for homosexual
partnerships. At its national conference in Weimar, Young Union delegates
voted to delete the corresponding clause from the conference agenda. The
leadership committee of the JU will now discuss the question internally.
The youth wing's mother parties, CDU and CSU, had earlier made it clear that
they were very critical of the idea of improving the legal status of
same-sex couples.

PDS wants to become third-strongest party in Bavaria
</H1>
At the PDS state conference in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, the Bundestag
representative for Coburg, Uwe Hiksch, said that there was great potential
in Bavaria for classical working-class policies and a left-wing party to
represent them. Hiksch just recently left the SPD to join the PDS. The PDS
plans to field candidates in every constituency in Bavaria in the next
municipal and state elections, for the first time.

German Book Trade Peace Prize
</H1>
The German Book Trade's Peace Prize (Friedenspreis des Deutschen
Buchhandels) has been awarded to historian Fritz Stern. The 73-year-old
German-American was given the prize in the Paulskirche church in Frankfurt
for his life's work. The jury decided that Stern had served peace through
building bridges of understanding between different peoples and times.
Stern has written about German and European history and about the Jews. In
his acceptance speech, he said that even in a reunified Germany with Berlin
as its capital, history could not be considered a closed book. He said there
was a need for responsibility, arising from the knowledge of the crimes of
the past. Stern said the victims could be honoured by keeping their stories
alive through historical research. He said that task was being pursued in a
notable way in today's Germany. Stern also appealed for the internal
reunification of Germany, calling it a condition for political stability.
