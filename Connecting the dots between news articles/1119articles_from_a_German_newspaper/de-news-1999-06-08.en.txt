Bundestage debate on Kosovo conflict
</H1>
In the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) debate on the Kosovo
conflict, the Federal Government and the opposition have both expressed
their hope for a near end of the war. In a policy statement, Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder said before [the war could end] the NATO peace plan
had to be fulfilled by Yugoslavia in all points. He also called the
deployment of a peace corp including German troops difficult and not
undangerous. CDU head Wolfgang Schaeuble as well called the mission
the most dangerous of the Bundeswehr (German Armed Forces) so far.

<P>
The Bundestag will vote on Thursday in a special session on the
participation of the Bundeswehr in the planned peace corp. Since most
opposition parties support the government policies in the Kosovo conflict,
it is expected that the parliament will vote for the participation of
up to 8,500 troops, as demanded by the government.

<P>
According to the "Berliner Morgenpost" newspaper the extra contingent of
German troops in Kosovo will increase costs by some DM 300 million per year.

Schroeder and Blair to modernize European social-democratic movement
</H1>
In the opinion of SPD head and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and Britains Prime Minister and Labour head Tony Blair, the social
democratic movement has to be fundamentally modernized. To this respect,
both politicians have presented today study outlining the principles
of such a haul up. The study calls for pro-business economic policies
through tax breaks, for a reform of the social system, for more
flexibility on the labour market and for a cut back on social benefits.
At the presentation of the study, Mr Schroeder said that in view of
the globalisation and of the liberalisation of the economy two problems
are of central importance: the fight against unemployment and the
preservation of solidarity. In fact, the notion of solidarity had to
be newly defined, and not - as demanded by the neo-liberals - totally
abondoned.

Slow growth of gross national product
</H1>
In the first quarter of this year, the gross national product
rose by 0.7 per cent compared to the same period one year ago, as published
by the Federal Department of Statistics. The growth was lower as in the
preceding quarters. In the whole of 1998, the GNP still rose by 2.3 per
cent. According to the Federal Department of Statistics, the GNP of the
first quarter of 1998 was in particular high due to mild weather high
consumer demand before an increase in value added tax (VAT or GST)
as of April 1, thus explaining the low relativ growth.

Teufel criticizes planned health care reforms
</H1>
 Baden-Wuerttemberg's prime minister Teufel has sharply
criticized the health care reforms planned by the Red-Green Federal
Government.  The CDU politician said that the reforms would lead to an
obvious deterioration in health care. On top of that, with the planned
hospital finance scheme, the government  has effectively eliminated
federal responsibility. At present, the state and medical insurance
companies share in the running costs of the hospitals. The reforms
entail that in the future the medical insurance companies will have to
cover the costs on their own.
