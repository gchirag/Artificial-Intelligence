Fischer meets with Arafat
</H1>
Foreign Minister Fischer met with Palestinian leader Arafat in Gaza
this evening  The Middle East peace process was the focal point of
this
discussion, as with prior ones in Jerusalem.  There, Fischer conferred
with Israeli Prime Minister Barak as well as his Israeli counterpart,
Foreign Minister Levy.  During that meeting, Barak is said to have
given
assurances that efforts for peace will be brought forward by all
diplomatic means.  Fischer made it clear that the role of the European
Union in the Middle East would be focused on economic support.
Attempting mediation in this conflict would be too much for the EU to
take on.  It is crucial that the parties concerned negotiate directly
with each other,  Fischer stressed.

Klimt: letter regarding SPD's course part of policy discussion
</H1>
State Premier Klimt, of the Saarland, has clarified that his
controversial paper regarding the SPD's future course should not be
taken as a criticism of the federal government.  The paper is not
attesting to bad decisions on the part of the cabinet, but rather
offering suggestions, said Klimt from Saarbruecken.  He was merely
fulfilling Chancellor Schroeder's request that the SPD engage in
discussions regarding the party's ideology and platform.  Schroeder
characterized Klimt's writing as an isolated opinion.  Klimt, in a
letter to the party committee, attacked the manifesto regarding the
future of social democracy that Schroeder and British Prime Minister
Blair had published in June.  Furthermore, he criticized the
government's
austerity program, and called for the reintroduction of a tax on
private
assets.

longer believes it is possible.  He has repeatedly asked CDU faction
leader Schaeuble to work with him on pension reform, but each time he
was refused with dubious arguments.  The Minister pointed out that the
government can pass the reform with or without the support of the
opposition.
