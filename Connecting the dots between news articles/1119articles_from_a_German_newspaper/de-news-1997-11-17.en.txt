attack in the upper Egyptian town of Luxor. The latest count is 78

killing them all with assault rifles. Subsequently they took hold of
another bus with French, German and Swiss passengers. Again, all of them
were killed. The terrorists are said to have then attacked with daggers
further tourists within the temple area. According to Egyptian

German ministers oppose over-ambitious EU employment policies
</H1>
Three days before the special European Union summit on employment policy
is to begin, the German government again voiced its opposition against
over-ambitious aims. In Brussels, federal ministers Waigel, Bluem, and
Rexrodt jointly spoke out against fixing rigid aims for improving the
labour market. Minister for Economy Rexrodt said the summit meeting had
to face reality. Paper, he said, would not produce jobs. Employment
policy had to be the responsibility of individual nations. The three
German ministers have gone to the Belgian capital to join their
colleagues from the other EU countries in laying the groundwork for the
summit meeting.

Part-time jobs for the aged regulated by metal and electric sectors
</H1>
The road has been paved for implementation of part-time jobs for older
workers in the metal and electric industrial sectors. Employers and
unions agreed to joint formulations regarding the disputed items. One of
the points agreed on was the assurance of accumulated overtime bonus
payments in case of the employer's bankruptcy. Also, overtime work that
occurred previous to the beginning of the part-time status can be
included in calculations. The Donaueschingen arbitration conceded the
right to part-time work for employees after their 61st birthday. They
can work for 2 years and stay homed for the 2 following years, receiving
82% of their last net wages over the course of 4 years. In Baden-
Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia, slight adaptations will have to
be made, because some employees with higher gross wages could receive
lower salaries than mandated by law.
