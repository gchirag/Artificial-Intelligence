200,000 for this year.  Chancellor Schroeder told the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange that the mood in the economy was changing from month to
month. Reducing the number of unemployed remains a joint task for
employers, unions and the state.  As for the take-over law planned for
this year, Schroeder said the government didn't want to hinder company
mergers.  The aim of business fusion, however, should not be to raise
stock rates over a short period in order to boost the yields of the
investors..  Growth projections, which include jobs, must be the prime
consideration for companies participating in a merger.
