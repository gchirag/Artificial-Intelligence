Schroeder and DGB-chief Schulte say Employment Alliance must succeed
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder and DGB-chief Schulte have affirmed their commitment
to the success of the Employment Alliance. Schroeder said that the
discussions taking place at the beginning of December should create a
climate of confidence. All sides will have to make concessions. On the
subject of the "620-DM jobs", Schroeder said the reorganization will take
place as he has previously outlined. The trade unions, however, still have
issues to be discussed. The DGB fears that these new conditions of
employment will be expanded. As for criticism from business owners
regarding the new Red-Green tax plan, the Chancellor said he saw no reason
to fundamentally alter the plan. In a newspaper interview, however, he
said the tax rates could be lowered if the tax base was widened at the
same time. Approximately 20 trade associations have appealed to Schroeder,
asking him stop the tax reform.
