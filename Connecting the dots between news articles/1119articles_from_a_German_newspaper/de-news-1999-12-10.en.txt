Turkey now an official candidate for EU-membership
</H1>
At their Helsinki meeting, the EU member-countries' heads of state declared
Turkey to be a candidate for membership. Previously Greece had relented and
stopped opposing her arch-rival's aspirations. Tonight, EU foreign politics
co-ordinator Solana and Mr Verheugen, who is in charge of the extension of
the EU, will fly to Ankara, to explain their decision. Other candidates are:
Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovakia, Malta, Hungary, Chechia,
Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.

EU Summit Meeting on establishment of rapid deployment force / Chechnya
</H1>
At their summit meeting, the EU heads of state decided to set up a rapid
deployment force. As of 2003, 15 brigades totalling 60,000 soldiers would be
available for deployment in crisis spots, provided NATO did not want to get
involved. The war in Chechnya cast a shadow over the Helsinki meeting: the EU
told Russia that they would think again about financial and political
co-operation with Moscow if Russia did not hold their horses in the war
against Chechnya. In the meantime, the Russian government unexpectedly
announced negotiations about the evacuation of civilians from the encircled
capital of Groszny.

Minor CDU Party Congress this weekend / Mr Kohl will not attend
</H1>
The secondary CDU party congress next Monday will probably not shed any more
light on the CDU-donations affair. Former Chancellor Kohl will not attend,
according to General Secretary Merkel, and there were no new findings either.
The reason was that some former CDU-politicians so far had not said what
they knew about the procedures being followed under Mr Kohl. Now family
policies will be on the meeting's agenda, as originally planned.

Pension at 60: Chancellor asked to mediate
</H1>
Business and trade unions are at loggerheads over the issue of drawing a
pension at age 60, and they are relying on Chancellor Schroeder for
mediation as they keep discussing the 'Treaty for Work'. Two days out of
the next meeting, nothing had moved, and that's why the boss of the
Metalworkers' employers Stumpfe called on Mr Schroeder - just as the head
of the Metalworkers' Union had done before, though the latter had also
threatened to can the talks. Mr Hundt, of the Employers' Federation, could
not see 'a big leap forward' happening in the next round of talks; the
unions, however, expected some progress.

Human Rights Day
</H1>
Today was Human Rights Day, and numerous organisations deplored massive
violations of the UN Charter of Human Rights. According to Amnesty
International, military and police kill people in 47 countries of the world.
In 66 countries hundreds of thousands of political prisoners were in jail,
without a proper trial. The Protestant Church deplored that 90 countries
still had the death penalty, and that this year the number of people
executed had even gone up.

Two dangerous inmates escape from Bruchsal jail near Karlsruhe
</H1>
Two supposedly dangerous inmates of Bruchsal jail, near Karlsruhe, have
escaped. The two 33- and 35-year old men overpowered a warden and are armed
with an MP. Police suggested that no-one should pick up hitch-hikers. Till
Friday night, the massive manhunt had been without success. One of the men
is from Romania and had been on life-imprisonment for attempted manslaughter
and other crimes; the other was a German serving a sentence for robbery and
blackmail.
