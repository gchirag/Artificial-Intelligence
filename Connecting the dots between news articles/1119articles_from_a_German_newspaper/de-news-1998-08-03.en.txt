CDU presents electoral platform
</H1>
In Schwerin today the CDU/CSU presented the second part of
its electoral platform, the reconstruction East and the
social policy. Reconstruction must have top priority. In
terms of social policy, CDU and CSU promise stronger family
support.
According to the state premier of Brandenburg, Stolpe, the
electoral platform of the CDU/CSU has crucial deficiencies.
In an interview with Deutschlandradio Berlin, he said that
he misses clear and reliable facts in this paper. CDU and
CSU do not mention the recent development, that the number
of regular jobs in the new states is decreasing.

The plan of SPD candidate for Chancellor Schroeder to stop
using atomic energy as fast possible caused heavy
reactions. The Minister of Economics, Rexrodt (FDP) accused
Schroeder of preparing the German economy to leave the
technological world league. Additio0nally, he would
endanger 40.000 highly qualified jobs . The Minister of
Research, Ruettgers (CDU) said that after shutting down
German nuclear power plants, atomic energy would have to be
imported from France or Eastern Europe.
The Greens welcomed Schroeder's plan. They consider it an
interesting starting point for negotiations with the SPD on
energy policy.

elections, he plans to shut down the six oldest German
nuclear power plants. For the rest of the nuclear power
plants, a phasing-out timetable should be set up.

Search in Lassing continues: Two bubbles surmised
</H1>
Despite the latest disaster the search for 10 victims of
the mining accident is to go on. This was announced by
mission control. The Minister of Economics, Farnleitner,
ordered new acoustic measurements for next night. Two other
bubbles are surmised to exist in the tunnel system.
According to medical judgment it is possible for persons to
survive underground for up to two months, if a sufficient
supply of air and water were available.
The two surmised bubbles are located at a depth of 145
metres and 175 metres, respectively. The rescue team will
try to advance with so-called hammer drilling. This kind of
drilling is faster but less accurate than the method used
so far.

Jagoda pessimistic on labour market development
</H1>
The President of the Federal Labour Office, Jagoda, is more
pessimistic on the development of the labour market then
Chancellor Kohl. Jagoda said to the Leipziger Volkszeitung
that in discord with the Bonn coalition he does not expect
the number of unemployed to decrease below the 4-million
level in the fall. Jagoda said he would be quit happy
should Kohl's forecast prove true. But in his experience a
slight increase in the number of unemployed might be
expected for the summer months. As to the question of a
turning-point in the labour market, Jagoda also has a
different opinion than the federal government. He
emphasised that a real turning-point would be reached when
the unemployment rate is lower than the year before for
three months in a row. Just now, this occurs in Western
Germany only.

Glogowski: Border guards will not become a federal police
</H1>
Lower Saxony's Minister of the Interior, Glogowski, does
not see the border guards growing into a federal police
force, despite their widened authority. Talking to
Deutschlandradio Berlin, the SPD minister said the new
scope of authority of the border guards concerning the
federal railway was reasonable. Furthermore, this scope of
authority would be naturally limited by space and occasion.
Nobody will have to be afraid of this widened authority
being a step in the direction of establishing a federal
police force.
