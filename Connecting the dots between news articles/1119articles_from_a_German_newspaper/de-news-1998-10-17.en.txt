Progress in Red/Green Coalition Negotiations
</H1>
The SPD and the Greens have agreed to increase the tax on crude oil by six
Pfennig as a first step, according to head of the SPD party Oskar Lafontaine
and the Green politician Kuhn. In return, the social security contributions
will be lowered by 0.8 percent points. According to Lafontaine, this will
save the average household approximately 300 DM a month. The SPD and Greens
also agreed to initiate a general speed limit of 30 km/h within city
limits. The only exception to this speed limit will be for main roads. A
discussion about speed limits on German Autobahns has been dismissed. The
parties also announced increased investments in rail traffic. The SPD and
Green continue to support the idea of the Transrapid train, but will not
invest additional federal money into the trains. Experts view this decision
as the death knell for the high-speed magnetic levitation train. The
negotiations between the SPD and the Greens are almost finished. The results
of the social policy negotiations will be announced on Sunday. Structural
and
personnel discussions will then begin on Monday and the coalition agreement
will be signed on Tuesday.
