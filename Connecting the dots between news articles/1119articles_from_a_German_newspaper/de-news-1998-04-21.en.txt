Committees recommend introduction of Euro currency
</H1>
The parliamentary committees for finances, foreign affairs and Europe
recommended that the parliament approves the introduction of the Euro
currency on 1 January 1999. Thus, a wide acceptance of the common currency
in the two houses of parliament, Bundestag and Bundesrat, seems guaranteed.
In a joint hearing Chancellor Helmut Kohl had promoted again the Euro and
stressed that the monetary union would also advance the political union in
Europe. Kohl said the monetary union is the most important decision since
the re-unification of the two German states. The conditions for the
stability of the new currency have never been as good as today.
In the Bundesrat even Euro-sceptics seem to turn around. The state premiers
of Lower-Saxony, Bavaria, and Baden-Wuerttemberg said they would vote in
favour. Saxony is going to vote against the common currency. The Bundestag
will decide on Thursday, the Bundesrat on Friday about the introduction of
the Euro.

Pungent criticism of FDP congress resolution to abolish solidarity tax
</H1>
The state premiers of East Germany have criticized strongly the FDP
congress' resolution to abolish the solidarity tax completely. [The tax was
introduced to help East Germany after the re-unification.]. Thuringia's
State Premier Vogel said he who wants to abolish the solidarity tax gives
the impression that the time of solidarity was over. Saxony-Anhalt's State
Premier Reinhard Hoeppner accused the FDP of having discarded the East. The
State Premier of Mecklenburg-East Pomerania Bernhardt Seite said the
subsidy of the new states must not be touched.
The FDP, however, stated that there was no disagreement in the government
coalition about the demand to reduce taxes drastically and to abolish the
solidarity tax completely. FDP faction leader Dorothee Solms stated that
each party has the right to independently adopt its own election platform
for the following legislative period. This was not a breach of the
coalition contract. Therefore, this topic was not raised at the coalition
meeting this morning.

Gysi continues to claim his innocence
</H1>
In a hearing by the parliamentary immunity committee PDS politician Gregor
Gysi has stated again that he has never worked for the Stasi [the former
East German domestic intelligence service]. He accused the committee of
trying to discredit him morally and politically. The committee had found in
March that there was unequivocal evidence that Gysi had worked as an
Unofficial Collaborator for the Stasi. Gysi has tried in vain to have the
report halted by the Federal Constitutional Court.

RAF letter genuine: discussions about consequences
</H1>
The voluntary disbandment of the terrorist "Red Army Fraction" (RAF) has
started up a broad discussion of the possible legal consequences. Union
politicians and constitution protectors have warned against a premature
lifting or relaxing of the anti-terrorist legislation brought into place in
the 1970s. Buendnis 90/The Greens argued however, that the legislation
should be annulled following the disbandment of the RAF. The acting
chairman of the SPD parliamentary fraction Schily and the FDP politician
Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger called for a relaxation of rules on criminal
prosecution. The Federal Crime Office reckons that the letter published
yesterday announcing the disbandment of the terrorist group as genuine. The
criminological examination showed that the RAF star on the letter
corresponded exactly with the symbol used in previous letters. The water
mark on the letter was also identical to that of previous letters.

value of DM66 billion abroad, according to the Federal Statistics Office.

further two percent to 28,000 cases. In 1997 the number of collapses, at
27,500, represented an increase of eight percent on the previous record. In
1991 there were only 9,000 insolvencies.

Letters reaching destinations quicker
</H1>
The length of time it takes for domestic mail to reach its destination has
decreased further. Some 94 out of 100 items are arriving within one day,
the Post HQ in Bonn announced. 99 percent of all letters arrive at least
within two days. Four years ago the results were only 83 percent arrival in
one day. The mail service puts the improvement down to the establishment of
around 60 mail centres. These centres can, depending on their capacity,
deal with up to 4.5 million items each day.

Schaven presents reform plan for Baden-Wuerttemberg leaving certificate
</H1>
The Baden-Wuerttemberg Culture Minister Schaven has presented the details
of her controversial reform plan for the school leaving certificate
(Abitur). In future the division between minor and major exam subjects will
be abolished. Instead, German, math, and one foreign language will be
compulsory exam subjects and taught four lessons [one lesson equals 45
minutes] per week. One additional "profile" subject must be chosen and will
also be taught four lessons per week. All other subjects will be taught 2
lessons per week. The Abitur exam will comprise four written and one oral
examination. According to Schaven the system will be introduced in 2001.
