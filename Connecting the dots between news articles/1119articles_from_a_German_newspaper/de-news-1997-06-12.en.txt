Third stage of health reform passed
</H1>
Starting in July, health insurance patients will have to make a
significantly larger personal contribution to the costs of medication and
hospital stays.  With the votes of the CDU/CSU and FDP party members, the
third stage of the health reform has finally been passed.  One of the
changes will be an additional fee of 5 DM for each medication prescribed.
However, it is expected that the insurance companies will refuse to
implement this second rise in surcharges.  They refer to an exception
clause, which states that the surcharge does not have to be increased if
the insurance company raised its premiums only because it had to pay more
into the general financial balance pool than expected.  Whether or not
this reasoning is valid, will be determined for each company individually
by the federal insurance agency in Berlin.  A decision is planned for
spring next year.  The opposition, social associations and labor unions
criticized the reform as "punishment for the sick".  The labor union DAG
wants to appeal against the new laws, right up to the Federal
Constitutional Court if necessary.

No agreement between coalition members on budget policy
</H1>
In the talks about financing the deficits in the federal budget, there is
still no sign of an agreement is between the two members of the
governmental coalition of CDU/CSU and FDP.  In addition, the tax reform
remains the subject of great dispute.  FDP-politician Mr. Graf Lambsdorff
has rejected plans to introduce an early surcharge for employers.  According
to newspaper reports, the planned taxation of shift payments will only be
introduced in several stages.  It is also reported that the coalition will
set the taxation of life insurances on a lower level.

</H1>
The CDU/CSU and FDP parties assembled in Bonn tonight to discuss the
planned tax reform and the budget situation in separate meetings.  Before

an agreement on the tax issue could be reached.  FDP spokesman, Mr.
Gerhardt stated that the lowering of the solidarity surcharge would bring
relief to all citizens in 1998.  He also said that the deficits in the
1997 and 1998 budgets must not be compensated for through tax increases.

</H1>

the district collective wage agreements.  Vice president of the Union, Mr.
Riester said at a district conference in Leinfelden that if nothing is
done, the collective wage agreements will continue to weaken.  The
structures need adjusting to take account of the changed conditions in
companies.  Mr. Riester also criticized the fact that current agreements
cannot be transferred to new branches such as the telecommunications
industry.

CDU criticizes demands for new cuts in social sector
</H1>
The CDU social-committees have expressed strong criticism for the demands
of the CDU economics-committee for further cuts in social benefits.  The
proposals show that the authors are completely out-of-touch with public
opinion and the belief that further cuts in social benefits cannot be
justified, said the deputy president of the CDU, Mr. Ahrens.  These kinds
of plans are not CDU but FDP products, he stressed.  No other area of
political life has made savings like the social sector over the past years.

Law violations during demonstrations will be a reason for deportation
</H1>
Foreigners who participate in illegal demonstrations have to expect
possible deportation in the future.  This change in the law was passed by
a mediation committee comprising members of both Bundestag and Bundesrat.
From now on illegal actions during demonstrations will be considered an
urgent reason for deportation, even without a trial.  The government
spokesperson on issues relating to foreigners, Mrs. Schmalz-Jacobsen,
expressed regret that the new law will also affect the children of
foreigners who have been living in Germany for a long time.

Fuel-elements from Grundmemmingen will not be recycled
</H1>
Burned out fuel-elements from the nuclear power plant in the Bavarian
town of Grundmemmingen will not be recycled for the time being.  Instead
they will be stored in Gorleben or Aarhaus, stated a spokesman for the
power plant's operating company.  He explained that interim storage is
cheaper than recycling.  However, if transports to the storage facilities
are continually hindered, the fuel-elements may have to be shipped to
recycling facilities in England or France.  The spokesman also announced
plans for several Castor-container shipments next year.

Soccer: Wolfsburg promoted into the 1. Bundesliga
</H1>
The third and last team to be promoted to join the 1. Bundesliga next
season is VfL Wolfsburg, together with the 1. FC Kaiserslautern and
Hertha BSC Berlin, who qualified earlier.  The team beat Mainz 05 last
night by a score of 5:4 in their final match of the season and finished
second in the overall standings, even ahead of Berlin.  The four teams who
will be relegated to the regional leagues are SV Waldhof Mannheim, VfB
Oldenburg, Rot-Weiss Essen and VfB Luebeck.  Mannheim's victory in
their final match at Luebeck by a score of 3:2, was not enough to keep
them in the league, since the two other teams fighting for the last
relegation spot, Fortuna Koeln and FC Guetersloh, won their matches as
well and thus avoided relegation.
