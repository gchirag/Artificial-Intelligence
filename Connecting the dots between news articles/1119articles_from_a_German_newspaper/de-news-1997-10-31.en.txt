Parliament raises sales-tax
</H1>
Today the governing coalition parties approved raising sales tax
to 16% - to take some of the heat off the public pension scheme by using
extra revenue for them. More than likely the draft will not get passed
into law, as the opposition SPD already declared they would vote it down
in the Upper House (Bundesrat). Federal Labour Minister Bluem accused the
SPD of deserting the public pension scheme in order to do their own
electioneering. The fact that the contribution rate to the public pension
scheme had to go up would underline the requirement for alternative
finance (meaning using part of the tax-take to plug holes in the pension
scheme).

Debate in parliament about crisis in pension scheme
</H1>
Today the association of pension schemes warned against higher contributions
and lower pensions - something impossible to ram down ordinary citizens'
throats these days. Government apparently agrees, though Federal Labour
Minister Bluem had to announce that the contribution rate to the public
pension scheme was to rise to a record 21%. And it looks like this is
final, in spite of a draft law about raising sales tax (see previous item).
Pension expert Andreas Sturm, of the CDU, blamed the consistently high
unemployment rate for the loss in revenue and the resulting higher
contribution rates. And that is why he thought it hard to believe the SPD
intended to vote against government's draft (to raise sales tax) using
their majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat). "If you throw a spanner in
the works now, you take the blame for long-lasting high contributions to
the pension scheme." This was refuted by Mr Dressler, of the SPD. The SPD
was against raising sales tax as it would help to finance a reform of the
pension scheme they had always been against (as it meant lower pensions).
"Mr Bluem wants to re-finance in order to get a tighter grip on people's
pensions. The SPD wants to re-finance to avoid cutting pensions."
Mr Dressler said government should the raise excise-duty on motor-spirits
to pay for the pension scheme (and leave sales-tax as is), and that would
not even require the Upper House's (Bundesrat) consent. There is some
disagreement within the coalition parties about raising the excise-duty
on motor-spirits.

Discussion about dual citizenship
</H1>
Head of the FDP Gerhardt showed signs of accepting a compromise in the
issue of dual citizenship. He said there was no general debate about
dual citizenship for foreign children; they rather should be offered a way
to reach integration and a chance to take out German citizenship. So far
the FDP was for automatically granting German citizenship to children
born in Germany (to non-citizens) once they turn 18. A majority in the
CDU/CSU parliamentary group, however, is against.

<P>
All parties agree that they disagree, though there are plans to give
foreigners a binding undertaking that they will be granted citizenship,
once they fulfil certain conditions.

Seven alleged toxic waste traffickers taken to court

The public prosecutor took seven alleged special refuse
traffickers to court, kicking off the biggest trial of offenders
against environmental laws so far. They were accused of having disposed of
dangerous toxic waste on a large scale for years. The alleged offenders
had been arrested during one of the biggest environmental raids last year.
40 more helpers including five public servants at the environmental
authorities are still being investigated.

No waiver for prosecutions
</H1>
Government decided to keep prosecuting certain offences in the former
GDR until the year 2000 - thereafter prosecution would be waived.
This would be for less than severe offences, such as manipulation of justice,
causing bodily harm and unlawful detention. The deadline would have expired
at the end of this year, practically putting a lid on prosecutions.

Problem at thermal power-plant
</H1>
85 persons suffered minor injuries when a thermal power-plant
had a problem. Eight of the persons concerned had to be taken to hospital
and treated for respiratory problems. Around midday, a leaking pipe had
discharged a mixture of lime and steam. The authorities appealed to the
population to keep doors and windows shut. According to the police, the
mixture was non-toxic, but could cause respiratory problems.
