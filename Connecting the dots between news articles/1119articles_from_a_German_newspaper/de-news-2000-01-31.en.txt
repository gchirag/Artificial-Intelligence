Schaeuble confesses to additional meeting with Schreiber
</H1>
CDU boss is running out of political space in the contributions
scandal. In a surprise declaration today, he admitted an
additional meeting with controversial armaments dealer Schreiber
in June, 1995. Nothing has transpired as to the purpose of the
meeting or to whether another financial contribution occurred.
Schaeuble had up to now insisted on having met Schreiber
only once, in 1994, on which occasion Schreiber was said to
have handed over the notorious DM 100,000 cash contribution,
but both Schreiber, who resides in Canada, and former CDU
treasurer Ms. Baumeister had disagreed with this version.

SPD and the Greens consider Schaeuble "unacceptable"
</H1>
SPD general secretary Muentefering said that Schaeuble's position
as CDU boss had become untenable. He said, "There is no longer
any political leadership of the CDU to be discerned." Schlauch,
Green faction leader, appealed to Schaeuble to resign. He'd come
to the end of his tether. In Schlauch's opinion, Schaeuble has lost
the last remnants of credibility and could no longer be relied on to
clarify the matter. And he certainly wasn't the right person to
provide
a new beginning for CDU.

CDU demands affidavit from Weyrauch
</H1>
After the testimony of financial consultant Weyrauch, who worked for
the CDU for many years, the party leadership now demands an
affidavit to put his declarations under oath. Yesterday, Weyrauch had
for the first time laid open the financial transactions of Hesse
state's
CDU. According to his testimony the state party section had
transferred
a total of DM 20.8 mn to Swiss accounts because of a tighter party
financing law that went into effect in 1984. Contrary to widely
circulated
press reports, none of these funds were transferred to the national
party,
according to Weyrauch.

CDU demands that Rau resign rejected by other parties
</H1>
Federal president Rau remains in the eye of the storm around the
so-called Duesseldorf flying affair. According to the media, during
his stretch as North Rhine-Westphalia's premier Rau had used
flight transportation paid for by the Westdeutsche Landesbank
for campaign trips, among others. His lawyer Lehr insists that all
these flights were service trips. Demands for Rau's resignation from
CDU politicians were branded by the SPD as red herrings to deviate
attention from the CDU's very own financial scandals. The Greens'
leader Ms. Roestel and FDP general secretary Westerwelle agreed
with the SPD's position.

EU threatens Austria with political ostracism
</H1>
The 14 EU countries threatened Austria with refusing to maintain
contacts with a Vienna government which includes right-wing
demagogue Joerg Haider. Haider's party takes a xenophobic stand,
which is not in accord with the European Union's principles. This is
the essence of a statement issued by the EU's council presidency
in Lisbon.
Austrian president Klestil intended to confer with Haider and OeVP
boss Schuessel on the status of the coalition talks.this evening.
In Vienna, foreign minister Schuessel said the Union's position
came as a surprise to him and he was trying to contact the
Portuguese council presidency as soon as possible.
The coalition talks are well along the way, and in Vienna it is
expected that a draft for a coalition agreement should be in
by tomorrow night.

</H1>
Boehm-Bezing, board chairman of ailing construction giant Holzmann,
tendered his resignation. The Deutsche Bank manager wants thereby
to clear the path for persons with a technical-industrial background.
Late last year, billions of DM in liabilities suddenly surfaced at
Holzmann, and the board of directors is being considered at least
partially responsible.
Neip, the former boss of Essener Ruhrkohle, will probably succeed
Boehm-Bezing.
