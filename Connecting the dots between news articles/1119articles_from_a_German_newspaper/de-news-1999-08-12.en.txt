Attempts to Mediate Dispute Over Prescription Drug Budget
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Andrea Fischer and representatives from the insurance
doctors association tried this evening to defuse the battle over the
prescription drug budget. Fischer (Greens) called the meeting in Bonn on
short notice in reaction to the threat by the physicians to counter the cuts
in the drug and medication budget with an emergency plan. According to this
plan, doctors would establish a waiting list for non-urgent medication if
budget shortfalls are expected. Thyroid medication as well as treatments for
fungal infections and diarrhea were named as examples. Health Minister
Fischer declared that she would issue a directive banning this emergency plan
if necessary. She said a waiting list for patients was unacceptable.

Greens "Realists" Present Agenda
</H1>
Several prominent Greens politicians have called for a new environment policy
and for closer cooperation with businesses. The "Realists," including the
spokesperson for the executive committee Gunda Roestel, presented a 10-point
agenda which called for reinstating the environment as the focal point of
political action. This was not to be taken as criticism of Environment
Minister Juergen Trittin, rather as an appeal to the entire party for a
reorientation. In the future, the Greens want to have ecology seen as a part
of modernization. A spokesperson for the Federation [of German Industry] said
that it was a welcome insight that environmental protection must be carried
out in a manner that was also to some extent compatible with business.

Discussion on Role of Armed Forces
</H1>
The military is not getting a break during the parliamentary summer break. In
a radio interview, SPD military expert Helmut Wieczorek renewed his call to
rethink the constitutional limitations on deployment of the armed forces to
purely military missions. It was not against the constitution for the armed
forces occasionally to assist in police operations, for example in securing
the border or combating smuggling rings. The debate was triggered by an
article in the "Bild" newspaper. The article referred to a classified speech
manuscript by Inspector General Hans-Peter von Kirchbach, according to which
the armed forces should prepare itself for new areas of engagement in view of
the decreasing threats of danger from the outside. Kirchbach himself
vehemently denied that the armed forces would be deployed for domestic
security in the future.

Charite Demands Compensation
</H1>
After a camera man's death of yellow fever, Berlin Charite wants to
have 400,000 DM reimbursed by the Berlin Senate. The hospital administration
said that since infectious diseases come under the purview of the state, the
loss of income from an entire ward emptied by the quarantine should be
reimbursed.

Bavarian Crime Statistics
</H1>
Bavaria is the safest state according to the crime statistics published today
by the Free State of Bavaria. Only five crimes are committed per 100
inhabitants - the national average is eight. In the first six months of the
year, the number of crimes fell by 1.2 percent to 325,000. State Interior
Secretary Regensburger said he was satisfied, "People always ask what the
reason could be that things are better in Bavaria than in other states. I
believe that we are on the right path when we do not tolerate lawlessness.
Secondly, I think it is also an exceptional quality that we have that the
relationship between the citizens and the police is for the most part a very
good one." Thefts, at 37 percent, made up the largest portion of all crimes.

Bitter Balance
</H1>
The July salary statement brought tears to the eyes of a cleaning lady at the
Bavarian state assembly: from her holiday bonus of 325 DM, only 3.48 DM was
left after deductions. The Revenue Office kept 99 percent for taxes and
social security contributions. The holiday money bumped the woman into a
higher tax bracket, thus not much was left.

Eclipse Epilogue
</H1>
Looking at the solar eclipse had consequences for a few fans of the natural
phenomenon. At least two people suffered eye injuries. It was particularly
bad for an 18-year-old Berlin man who lost 90 percent of his sight. A
15-year-old boy in Schwerin is threatened with permanent retina damage
because he looked directly at the sun. There was no mass rush on hospitals,
as was feared.

Steffi Graf Calls Press Conference for Tomorrow
</H1>
Steffi Graf apparently intends to end the guessing game on her future in
sports. The 30-year-old from Bruehl hastily called a press conference for
tomorrow. This is the first time in her career that she has done so. There
has been no word as of yet on the subject or the motivation, however after
the conjecture of the past weeks, clarification is expected.
