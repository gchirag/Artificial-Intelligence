More in-fighting within government-coalition
</H1>
There was more bickering within the governing coalition parties about
possible tax-hikes, and Mr Waigel did not rule them out before the
elections, stating that they would only take place if other taxes were
lowered at the same time. He also warned the FDP against attacking him any
more in his role as Finance Minister. If the Liberals jeopardised the
coalition, this would lead to their own demise. Yesterday Mr Lambsdorff, the
FDP-spokes-person for economic affairs, had predicted that the Bonn coalition
would come to an end in case the CDU/CSU insisted on higher taxes.

SPD's social expert criticises government's plans
</H1>
SPD-social policy expert Dressler strongly criticised Bonn's plans to
ease the unemployment- and superannuation-insurances' burden by dipping into
the old-age health insurance's funds, robbing Peter to pay Paul. They had
all agreed that any monies accumulated in the old-age sector were meant for
a rainy day. And apart from that, he would not trust government's assertions
that this was only a temporary measure and they would put the money back
later.:::Famous precedent: the so-called 'Juliusturm', a hoard that started
to accumulate under Chancellor Adenauer, earmarked for expenses to do with
the re-unification of Germany. At the time, all political parties were quite
happy to use it for other purposes:::

Chemical accident at Hoechst's
</H1>
Frankfurt on Main. One worker was injured during a chemical accident at
Hoechst's Frankfurt plant when 500 kilogrammes of heat-absorbing oil
leaked from a machine. According to the company, the man's lower arm was
scalded, but there had been no danger to the environment, according to the
Fire Service. As there was a cloud of smoke near the site, they asked the
general population to keep doors and windows closed to keep out fumes.

Stalemate in metal-workers award negotiations
</H1>
Nothing moved on the front between award negotiators as far as
the dispute about fully paid sick-leave in the metal-industry was concerned.
Mr Zambelli, of the union, said they would not talk about reducing pay or
holiday-entitlements in case of sick-leave. Mr Hund, spokes-person of the
employers, thought that reducing holiday-entitlements for paid sick-leave
was socially acceptable. Negotiations about the whole package-deal are still
continuing in Karlsruhe.:::So far employers keep paying 100% of your wage
every time you're on sick-leave, for a limited period, and you do not have
to use up your annual leave entitlement instead. Germany never had a system
where you had a set number of (cumulating) paid sick-days/year, like many
Anglo-Saxon countries:::

Mr Teufel for lowering of coal-mining subsidies
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg premier Teufel spoke out for lowering
subsidies for the mining of bituminous coal, stating that 10 billion
marks/year were not warranted. The money should be invested in technologies
of the future, instead of trying to keep obsolete industries afloat.
He proposed lowering them by 500 million marks/year. As of 2005, 2 billion
marks should be enough to keep Germany's leading edge in the area of
mining technology.:::There is no coal-mining in Baden-Wuerttemberg, yet
quite a few high-tech companies, including Mercedes:::

Freely available drugs not to be covered by health insurers
</H1>
In the future, public health insurers will not be allowed to
pay for drugs other than pharmacy-only and prescription drugs, according
to a report by the tabloid BILD, who referred to draft-legislation for the
third stage of health-reforms, thus effectively excluding drugs available in
health-shops and supermarkets. And there were to be more cuts to anything
to do with tooth-replacement.:::GPs give the prescription-form to the
patient, they hand it in at the local pharmacy, and the latter get
re-imbursed by the health insurer. It will be up to the GP to make sure
no-one's going to be out of pocket.:::

also for the holding company of Traub AG from Reichenbach in Suebia. One

companies.

Renewed bickering about nuclear power-plant Biblis
</H1>
The controversy between Hesse's government and Bonn's ministry
for the environment about the moth-balling of nuclear power-pant Biblis,
entered another round. Hesse's minister Nimsch, of the Greens Party, said
she would revoke the 1975 permit for part A because of grave safety concerns.
Experts had found that the 20-year old nuclear power-plant's safety could
not be be brought up to standard within the foreseeable future, and
therefore the plant had to be moth-balled. So far Hesse's government had used
injunctions, that subsequently had to be withdrawn, at the behest of the
federal ministry.

Hesse follows suit in checking if public servants are Scientology members

Just like Bavaria the state of Hesse plans to use questionnaires

that Hesse was striving for a maximum of compatibility between the
individual states' systems.

As of today, new retail-opening hours are in force. Shops may be
open from 6am to 8pm, weekdays, and 6am to 4pm on Saturdays, and bakeries
may sell bread and related products on Sundays. According to surveys, at
least a big proportion of shops in the cities will want to make good use of
the new opening hours, though some consumers will miss out today (this
being 'All Saints Day' in five federal states).

Baden-Wuerttemberg helps construction of 350 new homes
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg is to boost the construction of 350 houses for
young and low-income families with the help of a project started in
July, and its budget is to treble within the next year (currently it is set
at 1.7 million marks). Eight cities have been signed up for the project so
far, guaranteeing that the total cost of a multiple-unit house (Reihenhaus)
without garden will not be more than 300,000 marks.:::A Reihenhaus looks a
bit like a high-rise building on its side, though there are separate
entrances, cellars and attics for each family.:::

Strong criticism of fees for ancillary classes at Elementary School
</H1>
The union strongly criticised Baden-Wuerttemberg's proposal to
charge fees for ancillary classes at Elementary Schools, as of next
school-year, claiming that this would pave the way to general
tuition-fees. If parents were unable to pay up, they would have to enrol
their children for the standard classes at Elementary School, and that would
not make sense, as children could not be supported according to their needs.
According to the education minister, fees are to be approx. 80 marks/month,
about as much as parents pay for kindergarten.

UEFA-Cup ballot

Hamburg, one of the last three German teams still in the UEFA-CUP,
drew the short straw: in the eight-final on 19 November and 3 December,
the HSV will play against AC Monaco (deputy leader in France's soccer
league). AC Monaco had previously defeated Borussia Moenchengladbach,
virtually kicking them out of the UEFA-Cup. Karlsruhe and Schalke have an
easier job: the KSC will play Denmark's Broenby, in Denmark, and Schalke
Belgium's FC Bruegge, in Belgium.

From the editor's desk: more than 1 copy of GermNews
</H1>
Yesterday some readers received more than 1 electronic copy of GermNews,
that's the German edition. We regret this has happened, but are unable to
guarantee it won't happen again in the future. Here is why: though we
dispatch only 1 copy per reader, glitches in the transmission process around
the globe often fool transmitting computers into believing, that their mail
hasn't been accepted (yet), and, for safety's sake, and after a short delay,
re-transmit it. These problems are usually sorted out quickly, so you should
get your single copy of GermNews within the next couple of days, as usual.
