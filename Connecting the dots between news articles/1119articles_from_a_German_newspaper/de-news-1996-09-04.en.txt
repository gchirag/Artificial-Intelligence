SPD says 18 billion marks missing from 1997 budget
</H1>
According to the Social Democrats, there is an 18-billion-mark
budget gap in the draft budget for 1997. Budget expert of the SPD
parliamentary faction Diller called Finance Minister Waigel's draft
"cobbled together and unrealistic", and called on Waigel to come up with
amendments. Otherwise, Diller said, there was a real threat of an
unconstitutionally high level of new debt and of placing the European
monetary union in jeopardy.

Herzog on official visit to Czech Republic
</H1>
German President Herzog and Czech President Havel today visited
a youth meeting in East Bohemia. The four-day meeting of 250 adolescents
from both countries is designed to further understanding and to combat
prejudices. Herzog called on the youth of both nations to not let guilt
and suffering of the past stand in the way of a more humane future, but
rather to do better where previous generations had failed. The President
challenged the young adults to face history "with the courage to tackle
the whole truth".
Herzog advised patience in the issue of the desired joint declaration on
reconciliation between the two countries. He joined Havel in stressing
that the highest level of diligence was called for in view of the
difficulty of the problems at hand, and that a few weeks more or less
ought not to matter in this case. Havel expressed his hope that a
declaration would be signed in the near future despite the differences
of opinion.

Calm restored in subsidy row
</H1>
Bonn and Brussels have agreed on a compromise in the row over the
91-million-mark subsidy paid to Volkswagen by Saxony without permission
by the Commission of the EU. The compromise binds Bonn to the
undertaking to freeze a proportionate amount of funds earmarked for VW.
EU Commissioner Van Wiert said that as the car manufacturer was thus not
receiving more money overall, the Commission would refrain from applying
for an injunction. THe compromise meant that there was now some time in
which a legally acceptable solution could be found, Van Wiert added.
Economics Minister Rexrodt said he welcomed the decision by the EU
Commission. Speaking in Bonn today, he said the dropping of the
injunction threat afforded time for a rational solution to be found. He
added that he was hopeful that a positive result in the negotiations
would render the Commission's planned suit against the Federal
Government superfluous.

Greens executive spokesperson Trittin criticised
</H1>
The row over the party's direction in the ranks of the
Alliance 90/Greens continues, with Baden-Wuerttemberg State
Parliamentary Faction leader Kuhn publicly criticising Federal Board
Executive Spokesman Trittin. In an interview with the weekly newspaper
"Die Woche", Kuhn said a coalition offer to the PDS was wrong. If the
Greens decided to follow this path proposed by Trittin, they had already
lost, he continued, because in that case the debate during an election
campaign was not going to be over Green reform poltics but over the PDS.
On the contrary, Kuhn argued in favour of seeking and offering manifold
alliances within the middle-ground of society.
