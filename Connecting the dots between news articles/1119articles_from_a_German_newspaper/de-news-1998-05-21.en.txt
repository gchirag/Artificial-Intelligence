Temporary ban on Castor transports within Germany
</H1>
The federal government has banned all Castor transports, including
those within German borders, until further notice. This move was
caused by the occurrence of container leaks in British Sellafield
and the French La Hague plant. Until a technical safety measures are
developed to assure the non-repetition of this kind of contamination,
no reactor elements will be transported within Germany or to foreign
recycling facilities, says a communiqu=E9 from the federal ministry for
ecology. The Policemen=92s Union and the Social Democratic and Green
Parties had demanded a stop for Castor transports within the country
until precise information on the contamination danger can be obtained.
Meanwhile, the Bayern A.G. declared their intent to remove spent
reactor elements from their atomic plants. Bayernwerk board member
Wild declared that all demands made by the ministry for ecology would
be filled right away. Independent auditors have again and again
confirmed that up to now the transports have left the atomic plants
under strict observation of established rules. Atomic plant managers
in Germany admit having been aware of excess radiation for years.
Greenpeace called this "obvious criminal activities" by Germany's
atomic industry and called for immediate political consequences.
B90/Green Party spokeswoman Ms. Roestel said this was a breach of
confidence of a gigantic scale between politics and society and the
atomic industry.

Karl Prize for Geremek
</H1>
Poland's foreign minister Geremek was awarded the city of Aachen's
international
Karl Prize. The solemn ceremony, which took place in the city
hall's coronation room, was attended by President Roman Herzog,
among others. With Hungarian Prime Minister Horn and Czech President
Havel, Geremek is the third Eastern European politician to be awarded
this honor for his meritorial work in favor of European union. The
directorate of the Karl Prize, by this bestowal, is also paying
homage to the Polish nation's fight for freedom and their rightful
desire to become a full-fledged member of the European Union of
nations and countries. Hungarian President Goencz, in his laudatory
speech, honored 66-year-old Geremek as a courageous pioneer of a
democratic Poland firmly rooted in Europe. He said Geremek was one
of the prime leaders of the erstwhile democratic movement that had
fought from the start for an inclusion of their nation in the
European home. Geremek himself made an appeal that the EU's upcoming
expansion towards the East should be seen as an enrichment. Today's
Europe has nothing to fear from opening up, he said. Concurrently,
he praised the development of Polish-German relations.

Lukewarm response to proposal for new Labor Pact

The reaction of employers to the proposal the National Trade Union

Osnabrueck's daily "Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung" mentioned
initiatives within companies and between wage partners.
He said he was open to talks in principle, although the DGB  just
a few days ago had needlessly terminated the "Eastern Pact". New
talks about a possible new Labor Pact must not be burdened by
preliminary conditions by either side, he said.

Medical congress: German health sector needs radical treatment
</H1>
The radical treatment for Germany's [public] health sector
advocated by the national medical congress has been heavily
criticized by trade unions and the social security health
organizations. The participants of the congress, in a keynote
motion, had demanded that public health action should be
restricted to the absolutely necessary, expedient and sufficient.
Patients should pay for everything else.
The health insurance organization for [white collar] employees
called this demand a "frontal attack against the welfare State".
The national trade union federation (DGB) warned against further
increasing doctors' income at the cost of patients.
