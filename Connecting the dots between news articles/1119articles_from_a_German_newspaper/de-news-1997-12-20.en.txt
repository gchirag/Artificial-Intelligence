Suspicion of poisoned jam unwarranted
</H1>
 In the extortion case of the sandwich spread manufacturer
Schwartau, the latest suspicion of poisoned jam was unwarranted.  The
Luebeck Police Department refuted a report by the newspaper "BILD"
according to which a 19-year old student from Hamburg suffered from
impaired breathing and paralyses after consuming apricot jam.  The police
said that a medical examination of the man did not reveal life threatening
symptoms.  Although a foreign chemical was detected in a jar of jam that
had been purchased two days prior to the incident; it was not found to be
the poisonous agent Warfarin.  Rather, the chemical resembles dish soap
and is unlikely to have been added intentionally.  So far, a total of
three jars of jam laced with Warfarin have been discovered in Hamburg,
Holstein, and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.  An unidentified person had
poisoned the jam in an attempt to extort money from the Schwartau
corporation.

USA endorses EU membership of Turkey
</H1>
In light of the disputes surrounding the EU membership of Turkey, the US
Government has again voiced its support for the integration of Turkey into
Europe.  After a meeting of President Clinton with the Turkish Prime
Minister Yilmaz in Washington, Vice President Gore said the USA encourages
further talks between Ankara and the European Union.  A White House
official said the USA has long endorsed the EU membership of Turkey.  The
CDU politician Lamers rejected statements by Mr. Yilmaz as inappropriate.
In an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio Mr. Lamers was concerned that
Mr. Yilmaz' expression of disappointment over the EU's rejection of
Turkey's immediate membership would not encourage a dialogue between
Ankara and Bonn.  On Deutschlandradio Berlin, the chairman of the Turkish
community in Germany, Mr. Keskin, accused the EU of discriminating against
Turkey because of its cultural and religious differences.

The Greens recognize democratic mind-set of Bundeswehr soldiers
</H1>
Alliance 90/The Greens have acknowledged that the majority of Bundeswehr
soldiers has a democratic attitude.  At the same time it is alarming that
soldiers increasingly approach members of parliament, because the military
leadership will not listen to them, the Green's spokesperson for military
issues, Ms. Behr, pointed out.  The Bundeswehr is absolutely in a position
to address its own problem in public debate, Ms. Behr said in an interview
with the newspaper Berliner Tagesspiegel.  This, however, Ms. Behr added,
requires turning away from the current style of leadership advocated by
Mr. Ruehe which discourages critical thinking within the armed forces.

ideas to him.

Tax Payers Association demands explanation of Zwick affair
</H1>

the Zwick case, after the verdict against the spa and bath entrepreneur
had been revoked.  In an interview with Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio the

forth between the Prosecutor's jurisdictions of Munich and Landshut.
Previously the head of the Bavarian SPD, Ms. Schmidt, had accused the
CSU-run state government of applying different standards to tax
investigations.  While ordinary criminal acts are being prosecuted
according to the book, open and unresolved tax cases are accumulating, Ms.
Schmidt concluded.
