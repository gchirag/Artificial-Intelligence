Budget deficit of the Federal Government for 1997 lower as expected
</H1>
The budget deficit of the Federal Government for the last year turned
out to be a lot lower as expected. According to the Minister of Finance
Waigel, the net borrowing of 65 billion DM is by 6.2 billion DM lower
than the estimated value for 1997. For the supplementary budget Mr Waigel
had
originally planned a further new indebtedness of 70.8 billion DM.
Mr Waigel says that to make this reduction was possible because of a
2.4 billion DM lower grant given to the Federal Labour Office. Especially the
job creation measurements led to major savings. Due to the lower deficit, the
federal government has made its contribution to fulfil the euro criterion.

DGB wants to adopt a harder line towards employers
</H1>
The German federation of trade unions (DGB) wants to adopt a
harder line towards the employers. The chairman of the DGB Schulte
declared at the traditional New Year's press conference that the time of
obligingness and offers is up. This year the employers have to expect harder
labour disputes and higher wage claims. The employers didn't keep their
promise
to create new jobs although the trade union had already made major
concessions
for it. According to Mr Schulte, the german economy makes a lot of money and
the employers still expect employees and people with a lower social status
to
make sacrifices. The profits should no longer be kept only to shareholders
and
foreign exchange speculators. Mr Schulte also asks for a quick progress that
leads to a tax reform that will ease the burden for low and average income
employees.
He also announced that the DGB will significantly be envolved with the lower
house of parliament elections in 1997.
