Kohl meets Chirac
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has met in Bonn today with President Chirac of France.
European politics and international topics were on the agenda.  The central
issue was the implementation of the uniform European currency according to
schedule.  Prior to the talks, the Federal Ministry of Finance had conceded
that this year, Germany will most likely not be able to meet the criteria of
the Maastricht treaty.  Kohl and Chirac nevertheless want to keep the
schedule toward the European Economic and Currency Union.  After the meeting,
Kohl said in Bonn that both countries are committed to apply the criteria of
the Maastricht treaty without exception.  Chirac explained that one is aware
of the economic difficulties and the impact on society.  However, Germany and
France will be ready by the designated deadline.  Commenting on the proposal
to postpone the membership of certain countries until 1999, Kohl said it is a
mistake to envision such scenarios before the decision has to be made.  He
concluded saying that in the long run, freedom, peace, and social stability in
Europe can only be insured by growing closer together.

Kanther sticks to schedule for repatriating refugees in fall
</H1>
Federal Interior Minister Kanther came out in favor of returning Bosnian
refugees to their home country in fall.  On Deutschlandfunk radio he did not
rule out issuing corresponding orders, because he is under the assumption
that calling for a voluntary return will probably prove insufficient.
Moreover, he recalled that the date to start the return had already been
moved once, from July 1 to October 1.  He expects the convention of the State
Interior Ministers, convening in mid-September, to determine a binding
resolution in this question.

Research and economy to cooperate more closely
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has called on representatives of research and economy to
cooperate more closely in the future.  At the annual reception at the
research facility Juelich, Kohl criticized that in Germany the road from an
invention to a marketable product is still too long.  In order to convert
research results in a faster and better way, all parties have to intensify
their cooperation.  Only then can the location Germany remain competitive in
the 21st century.  Kohl called on scientists to found more high-tech
companies, because one could sometimes get the impression that science and
economy live in two different worlds with very few points of contact.

Top tax rates to drop below 40%
</H1>
 Within the framework of the planned tax reform, Federal Finance
Minister Waigel intends to cap income tax at less than 40%.  In an interview
with ZDF [public TV station], Waigel announced to simultaneously lower the
entry-level tax rate to about 20%.  In view of a possible increase in
V.A.T. [value added tax, sales tax], the Minister said it is important to
attain the right ratio between direct and indirect taxes.  Excessive direct
taxes are harmful for the economy, services and export.  Commenting on
reports about new budget deficits of billions of DM, Waigel said that he had
based his calculation of a borrowing level of 59 billion DM on revenue
estimates and economic parameters which were current at the time.  In the
meantime, the economy took a different turn, though.  For instance, the
Federal Labor Office had to spend eight billion DM more than projected, due
to high unemployment.  Waigel said he is not willing to yield to the FDP's
urging to enact the grand tax reform ahead of schedule, in 1998.  The FDP
should stick to what the coalition had agreed on this spring, the Minister
emphasized.  If a conflict in this matter is necessary, it will be fought
out, Waigel concluded.

Number of ethnic Germans migrating to Germany continues to drop
</H1>
According to the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the number of ethnic
Germans migrating to Germany continues to decrease.  Ethnic Germans are
Germans in the sense of the constitutional definition, but live in enclaves
abroad.  In August, 14,600 ethnic Germans came to Germany, that is 3,500 less
than during the same month one year ago.  Simultaneously, the number of new
applications from the states of the former Soviet Union plunged by almost
half, the Ministry informed.  Altogether, since the beginning of the year
about 19,000 fewer ethnic Germans than in the same period last year have
moved to Germany, Mr. Waffenschmid said, federal commissioner for ethnic
German issues.

Data protection practice at Deutsche Telekom criticized
</H1>
The Federal Commissioner for Data Protection, Mr. Jakob, criticized the data
protection practice at Deutsche Telekom [German telecommunications
monopolist].  Jakob said on Hessischer Rundfunk radio that the brochures,
accompanying telephone bills since August, informing about novel directory
services on CD-ROM and "Comfort Inquiry" are completely insufficient.  The
publication is designed in such a way that telephone customers cannot
recognize their legal rights that the offer entails.  For instance, the form
does not provide the option to decline the listing of personal data on the
CD-ROM version.  Customers have to raise their objection separately in
writing, a fact the company has not publicized.  The commissioner put forward
to repeat the campaign in a clear and transparent way.

Stricter penalties demanded for unobserved resting time
</H1>
The CDU/CSU spokesman for transportation-related issues, Mr. Geis, has
demanded stricter penalties for truck drivers who do not observe breaks
required by law.  Geis commented the case of a truck driver, who was stopped
after 44 hours behind the wheel, by saying that those who act in such an
irresponsible way should be punished like drivers under the influence of
intoxicants.  Geis endorsed withdrawing the driver's license in such cases.
Moreover, Geis said one has to evaluate if employers who force their drivers
to excessive working hours behind the wheel could be punished as abettors.

Criminal behavior among children and juveniles on the increase
</H1>
According to the chairman of the union of police (GDP), Mr. Lutz, crimes
committed by children and juveniles have assumed a frightening extent.  Lutz
told the Bild am Sonntag Sunday newspaper that Germany is heading toward
American conditions.  Based on figures for the first half of the year, an
increase of more than 10% in criminal offenses committed by children and
juveniles has to be expected for 1996.  The perpetrators are of younger and
younger age, and their methods become more and more reckless and violent.
This is a sign for a continued brutalization, Lutz said.  Even eleven or
twelve-year-olds commit crimes.  The GDP president called on the parents to
live up to their responsibility in raising their children.  Eleven and
twelve-year-olds are loitering in the streets until late at night, without
the parents' knowing about their offsprings' whereabouts.  The police cannot
be held liable for this development.

</H1>
Neuenmarkt, district Kulmbach.  Even hours after eruption of a large-scale
fire at a warehouse for waste plastics, the cause remains unclear.  The fire
department has been fighting the flames since 2pm.  Especially developing

fire had already broken out in the same warehouse.
