general Hintze. Mr. Hintze had called the speech at the award
presentation an `intellectual low', but acknowledged that Grass had
generalized.The author would have been more successful if he had

SPD demands more preventive measures against juvenile crime
</H1>
The SPD demands more preventive measures to fight juvenile crime. A
speaker of the party mentioned at a press conference that according to
police statistics more and more young people are committing crimes.
The number of children committing robberies on the street has more
than doubled within the last 3 years. The SPD wants to find the root
cause of juvenile crime. When children and teenagers turn into
shop-lifters and street robbers, the cause must be a social one. Youth
unemployment, the loss of traditional values and family ties,
increasing poverty in Germany are reasons to establish a prevention
plan like street social work for endangered and violent youths.
