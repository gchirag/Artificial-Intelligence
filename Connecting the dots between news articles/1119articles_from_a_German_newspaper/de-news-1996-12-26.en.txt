Assailant of Christmas Service in Frankfurt identified
</H1>
According to the police, the assailant of the Christmas Service in
Frankfurt/Main has been identified as a 49-year-old woman from the suburb
Frankfurt-Roedelheim who was undergoing psychiatric therapy.  As of yet, the
authorities still do not know how the woman obtained the two hand grenades
that she detonated on Christmas Eve in the Protestant Church of Sindlingen.
According to a first assessment, the explosives were of East European
production.  Further details were not disclosed.  However, Hessischer
Rundfunk radio reported in addition that the police now assumes the
perpetrator had personal motives, the church as location for the assault
being an arbitrary choice.  Aside from the woman herself, the explosion
killed two more people and injured 13 others.  According to a police
spokesman, the condition of a severely injured child has stabilized.  His
mother, however, is still in critical condition.

Rushdie would not be repeated as long as the Public Prosecution does not
insult Allah or the prophet Mohammed.  It is possible, however, Ardabilih
said verbatim, that the people's untamed furor may culminate in the a storm
on the German Embassy to Teheran.

similar concerns.  Moreover, he added, the government's plan to halve
unemployment figures by 2000 become less and less realistic.  In the same
newspaper, the president of the German Trade Convention (DITH), Mr.  Stihl,
welcomed the latest collective bargaining agreements, but he called it

President Ms. Vollmer demanded to return to a reasonable and factual debate.
Ms. Vollmer of Alliance 90/The Greens suggested that representatives of all
parties should engage in talks about the reputation of the parliament.  In
the opinion of Ms. Vollmer, the Parliamentary President did abide by the same
rules regarding travel that had already been in place under her predecessors.
It is unacceptable, Ms. Vollmer concluded, to tighten them retroactively and
then to construct accusations from these.
