Federal Government Denies Reports of Tax Cuts
</H1>
The federal government has denied reports that Chancellor Kohl hopes
to pass noticeable reductions in tax rates as early as 1998. In an
interview in Bonn, speaker of the government Hausmann denied the
correctness of an article published by the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag," in
which the paper had claimed that in view of the upcoming federal
elections, the Chancellor had considered introducing tax cuts. However,
during unofficial talks, there had been mention of a reduction in
solidarity as well as in income tax. Until now, Kohl had maintained that
there would be no tax cuts until 1999.

Herzog Completes State Visit to China
</H1>
Federal President Herzog has completed his state visit to China and
overall gave the trip positive marks. Concerning the political
negotiations in which he participated during his stay, Herzog commented
that this had been his most difficult foreign visit to date. However, it
had become evident that despite differences in opinion an open dialogue
was going to be possible. When asked why he had been able to address the
subject of human rights more openly than Foreign Minister Kinkel, Herzog
noted that he usually attempted to convey unpleasant truths
diplomatically. He did not want to give any, possibly premature,
evaluation of his specific accomplishments during this visit. He did note,
however, that there was no question that he would continue the dialogue
with a future super power like China. When asked how much longer he
thought China would be able to play individual Western countries off
against each other, Herzog answered that the Western countries were still
lacking a coordinated political approach toward China. In a mild rebuke of
his government, he added that at least Bonn had not been able to give him
any specific information on the subject.

Iranian Police Prevent Anti-German Demonstration
</H1>
Iranian police have prevented a demonstration by Islamic extremists in
front of the German embassy in Teheran this morning. Several hundred armed
police officers held back the demonstrators. One police leader told the
crowd that after the appeasing speech of Iranian President Rafsandchani
(sp?), there was no more need for anti-German protests. On Friday,
Rafsandchani (sp?) had defended Germany despite massive protests in his
country regarding the Mykonos trial.

<P>
Foreign Minister Kinkel has reaffirmed his former statement that he was
going to continue his current policy toward Iran. In an interview with the
TV station "ZDF" today, he said that despite obvious problems the dialogue
was to be continued. Last week, the cabinet also showed its support of
this course of action. 
<P>
The Iranian parliament rejected a proposal by some
two hundred representatives calling for a re-evaluation of the political
ties to Germany in light of the Mykonos trial.

Requests to Limit Side Jobs of Judges and Public Servants
</H1>
Bonn politicians and the German taxpayers' association have called to
limit the time spent on side jobs by judges and civil servants. They
voiced their request in the wake of the recent scandal around the
president of the Hesse State Court, Heinrichs, who has now resigned. In an
interview with the newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung," the
speaker for judicial politics of the CDU parliamentary section, Geis,
called all judges to be cautious about taking on side jobs. His
counterpart for the SPD, Martenbach, suggested to tie each license to take
such work to the honorarium for the job in question. The president of the
taxpayers' association, Daeke, noted that such extraordinary jobs were not
well regulated and were too easily licensed. He proposed that in the
future such side jobs should be closely monitored.

Early Release of Sexual Offenders to be Made More Difficult
</H1>
Federal Minister of Justice Schmidt-Fortzig plans to tighten the
conditions under which for sexual offenders can be granted parole. In an
interview with the newspaper "Hamburger Abendblatt," the minister said
that the bill outlining this change was going to be introduced next week.
The minister voiced his concern about the fact that sexual offenders were
often released from custody without proper counseling. Schmidt-Jortzig
proposes that in the future, these cases should not be decided strictly by
the book but with the help of interviews with professional counselors.

</H1>
In Stuttgart this afternoon, after three days, the deliberations about a
multinational fast action troop for Zaire were brought to a close.
Military experts from the USA and Canada, as well as from six European
countries participated in the meeting. Germany was not represented, since
it does not plan to contribute soldiers in its help for the refugees in
Eastern Zaire. The USA and Canada especially had called into question the
mission, after several hundred thousand refugees had returned to Rwanda
from Zaire.

No Benefit in Letting Cars Warm Up
</H1>
The ministry of transportation in Baden-Wuerttemberg notes that
there is no benefit in warming up cars before driving. The report
illustrates that a regular combustion engine does warm up fastest during
driving, rather than standing, operation. Furthermore, a cold engine that
was running while a car was not moving, was using too much gasoline and
brought about unnecessary emissions, the report concluded.
