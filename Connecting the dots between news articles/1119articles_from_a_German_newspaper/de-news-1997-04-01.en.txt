German President Herzog in Malaysia
</H1>
Kuala Lumpur. At the beginning of his visit to Malaysia, German President
Roman Herzog said a central issue of today's politics is the dialogue
between the different cultures and religions of the world. At a state
bankett at Kuala Lumpur, Mr Herzog said this applies in particular to the
relationship between Christianity and Islam. The German president
added Germany and Malaysia shall both together contribute towards the
prevention of a global war of cultures. Desirable were rather the creation
of, as Mr Herzog put it, a universal civilisation where all cultures can
fully develop.

CDA demands joint efforts against unemployment
</H1>
The Christian-Democratic Employees Association (CDA) called on
politicians, employees, unions and interest groups to fight together
against mass unemployment. It was not enough to just demand sacrifices
from others, said the Chairman of CDA's Board of Directors, Mr Eppelmann,
at the presentation in Bonn of a job creation scheme.
The CDA suggests among other things that employees and employers shall
agree on pay rises below the inflation rate in future, and as well as cuts
in social welfare benefits. Mr Eppelmann urged companies to employ more
people in their turn. It was also necessary that companies developed new
products and opened new markets in Eastern Europe, Asia and Central America.
Having mentioned this, Mr Eppelmann also criticised the self-satisfaction
of German industry. The association also calls for more part-time jobs
and less working overtime. The 30-point plan is to be discussed at CDA's
Federal congres at Magdeburg end of May.

<P>
As a first reaction, Social-Democrats (SPD) rejected the concept. The SPD
politician, Mr Buettner, said the collective bargaining agreements of the
past years hardly provided for compensation for inflation. It was obvious
CDA had lost touch to the real world.

No investments by communities because of uncertain Federal budget policy
</H1>
German communities can hardly make any investments due to the quarrels
in Bonn about the future fiscal, social and budget policies. The designated
Chief executive of Landsberg District Council stressed in a newspaper
interview that communities have postponed investments of more than ten
billion marks because of the uncertain Federal fiscal policy. Due to this
delay, many more jobs get lost and the economic recovery is hampered.

Federal government determined to make cuts in social welfare benefits
</H1>
The Federal government has reaffirmed their determination to cut
social welfare benefits. CDU/CSU's leading politicians gave as a reason for
the cut the need to reestablish a big enough gap between state benefits and
the minimum income.

<P>
The proposed cuts of the coalition government met strong resistance by
Social Democrats and the Greens. They accused the government of balancing
the Federal budget for the planned European Monetary Union to the
disadvantage of people with low incomes.

German Rail increases prices
</H1>
Travelling by train is more expensive starting today. Deutsche
Bahn AG (German Rail) increased prices in West Germany by 1.4 percent, and
by almost 5 percent in East Germany. However, tickets for travelling in
East Germany are still some seven percent cheaper than in the West. The
BahnCard [a discount card providing 50% off any train fares for one year],
too, became more expensive for the first time since its introduction in
1992. For travel in second class, the price rises from DM220 to DM240,
while the BahnCard First [for travelling first class] now costs DM480
instead of DM440 earlier.

No leads in Krefeld arson attack yet
</H1>
One day after the arson attack on the appartment of a Turkish
family, a DM50,000 reward has been offered for any information leading to
the perpetrators. A Public Prosecutor's spokes-person said they got many
phone calls concerning the crime, but they did not have any lead yet. In
the fire in the third floor of the appartement house in Krefeld, a
Turkish woman and two children died in the night from Sunday to Monday.

<P>
In Neuss (close to Duesseldorf), a hostel for asylum seeking persons partly
burned out. No people were injured by the fire. In this case, however,
police excluded xenophobic motives as the reason for the fire.

<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan has accused the European states of
being partly responsible for the recent arson attacks in Krefeld and
Den Haag by initiating an anti-Islam campaign.

Main defendant in Mykonos trial talks
</H1>
After the closing words of one of the defendants in the Berlin
"Mykonos" trial, the verdict scheduled for April 10 may be postponed.
The Lebanese, Mr Raie (sp?), who allegedly fired deadly shots at the
victims, broke his silence in the courtroom after 3 1/2 years. At Berlin
Regional Court, he said he was innocent and filed a new motion the
judges now have to decide on. Earlier, the second main defendant,
Mr Darabi (sp?), again denied all charges. Two other defendants, too,
said they were innocent.

<P>
The Iranian and the four Lebanese are charged with the murder of four
Iranian opposition politicians in the Berlin reastaurant "Mykonos" in 1992.
The Public Prosecutor accusses the defendants of murder and attempted
murder and has asked for sentences between five years and life-long. The
Federal Public Prosecutor's office believes the Iranian government stands
behind the attack.

war refugees. The Minister of the Interior, Mr Glogowski, said for the time
being only singles and couples without children are to be deported. From

Bosnian child-age war refugees to return to Bosnia
</H1>
Thirty Bosnian children who fled the war and who lived in
Saxony-Anhalt for 1 1/2 years left Germany by plane today at midday.
Accompanied by eleven German and Bosnian educators and psychologists,
the group parted from Berlin to Sarajevo.

<P>
According to a spokes-person of Saxony-Anhalt's welfare ministry, the
children aged between seven and eleven years parted on free terms, that is
they were not deported. The persons having the care and custody of the
children had been convinced that the children will be properly taken care
of in their home country. Member of the State Parliament for the CDU,
Mr Knolle, though, said the return of the children was forced.

UNHCR sees problems with deportation of Bosnians
</H1>
The UN High Commisioner for Refugees (UNHCR) sees many problems
caused by the deportation by Germany of Bosnian war refugees. The
organisation's representative in Bonn said this morning on NDR radio station,
many people are not able to return to where they lived before the war.
Therefore it is necessary to consider the ethnic origin and the area where
they lived before the war when deciding on the deportation. This
differentiation among the refugees is missing in the decision by the
Federal and State Interior Ministers on the deportation. The UNHCR believes
that people are deported from Germany who still need protection. Also,
there is not enough housing for people returning to Bosnia.

Failed loan to Kirch prompts Stoiber to restrict power of LfA
</H1>
After the million-mark loan to media giant Kirch did not come off,
Bavarian Interior Minister Edmund Stoiber wants to restrict drastically
the credit business of state-owned bank Landesanstalt fuer
Aufbaufinanzierung (LfA). In the future, loans to private companies
shall not excede DM50 million, Mr Stoiber said. LfA's share in the loan to
Kirch was supposed to be some DM500 million. In addition, the State Premier
wants LfA to concentrate on the promotion of small and medium-sized
companies. The proposal is supposed to pass the cabinet on April 8.

<P>
The Kirch group surprisingly turned down the LfA loan last Friday after
much political upset.
