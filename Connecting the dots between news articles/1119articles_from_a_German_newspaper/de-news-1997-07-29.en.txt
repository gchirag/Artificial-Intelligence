Situation still critical in Oder region
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has promised quick and unbureaucratic help
for people living in the areas affected by flooding in the State of
Brandenburg.
During a visit to the Oderbruch region, Mr Kohl assured the inhabitants that
they will not be left in the lurch. Affected farmers could also count on help.

<P>
Although the water level is falling slightly, the situation in the flooding
areas is still serious since the dikes are soaked with water. By an extensive
employment of Bundeswehr troops, it was possible to prevent the sliding away
of a dike in the northern Oderbruch region yesterday.

<P>
As a precaution, authorities in Potsdam advised helpers and inhabitants
in the flooding areas to take out vacination against typhoid fever and
hepatitis A. For the time being, there is no danger of an epidemic, though.
The vaccinations for a first group of 5,000 people will start on Thursday.

Tax reform likely to have failed
</H1>
Neither the coalition government nor the opposition expect an agreement
on the issue of indirect wage costs in the tax reform talks anymore.
Secretary-general of SPD's parliamentary faction Peter Struck said the
coalition government was obviously not willing to lower indirect wage costs
as soon as October, as demanded by the SPD. CDU politician Mr Repnik
accused the Social Democrats of trying to destroy the pension reform by
demanding the agreement on indirect wage costs. Earlier, both sides had
already admitted the failure of the big tax reform. However, progress has
been made on the issue of the planned abolition of the local trade tax on
capital. Here, both sides still expect an agreement in the mediation
committee hearing tomorrow.

Hessian court stops spelling reform
</H1>
For the first time a court has stopped the adoption of the
spelling reform. The Wiesbaden Administrative Court has granted a rush
petition by a father from Marburg to stop the adoption of the new
spelling rules at Hessian schools. According to the court, the spelling
reform was such a decisive change in educational policies, that it could
not be adopted by a simple decree, but only a new act of law. The
Ministry of Cultural Issues in Wiesbaden will have to decide within the
next two weeks, whether they want to appeal the decision. The court has
not yet made its final ruling on the issue.

<P>
Opponents of the spelling reform have welcomed the decision calling it
the "beginning of the end" [of the reform]. The leader of the CDU faction
in the State parliament of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Oettinger, repeated his
criticism that the Council of the State Minister of Cultural Issues
bypassed the State parliaments in that issue. Federal Education Minister
Juergen Ruettgers said he now considers the reform to have failed.
A reform as important as this one could not be implemented without
sufficient public debate.
