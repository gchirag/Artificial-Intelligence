Stoiber: Schaueble is qualified to take on any political office
</H1>
Wolfgang Schaueble, the parliamentary leader of the CDU/CSU, is
according to Bavaria's state premier Edmund Stoiber qualified to take on
any
political office. He said in an interview that the comments made by Mr.
Schaueble's wife should not be used as a political instrument. He also
criticised the current internal debate in the CDU/CSU regarding the post
of
Chancellor. He continued that he did not think it was a good idea to talk
about a successor to Chancellor Kohl, when Kohl was still party leader for
the coming elections. Mrs Ingeborg Schauble had said in an interview that
she thought, due to health considerations, her husband should not be
Kohl's
successor as Chancellor. This triggered renewed debate within party ranks.

New jobs to be created through combination wage in the retail trade
</H1>
The German Retail Trade Association (HDI) estimates that new jobs
could be created through the government subsidised wage ("Kombilohn").
Mr. Wenzel, Managing Director of the HDI, said that the wage scheme could
be
applied to around 100 000 firms and that "if only half of these companies
take on one unemployed person, that would still mean 50 000 jobs". At the
same time, however, Mr. Wenzel cautioned that "Kombilohn" jobs could well
threaten normal jobs. The CDU/CSU have proposed that the wages of
long-term
unemployed be subsidised if they accepted low-wage jobs. This could be up
to
77 percent of their last net wage.
