Bruederle considers compulsory military service obsolete
</H1>

demands. Only an army of professionals could master the modern and complex
technology because the training period for draftees is too short. The FDP

Siegfried Lenz: orthography reform unnecessary
</H1>
The author Siegfried Lenz criticized the orthography reform in an interview
with Deutschlandfunk radio today. He said the measure would shallow the
language and that current orthographical rules had proven effective. A reform
would lead to confusion. The writer added that a project of this dimension
should have been voted on by the public and wondered whose interests the reform
might serve. It would cost billions of marks which hardly could be spared. Lenz
is one of the authors, philologists, and publishers who signed the so-called
Frankfurt declaration last week, calling for an immediate halt of the reform.
