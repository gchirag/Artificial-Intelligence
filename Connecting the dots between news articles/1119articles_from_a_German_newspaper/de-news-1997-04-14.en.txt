Coalition's pension reform proposal met with resistance
</H1>
The key points of a pension reform drawn out by experts of the governing
coalition over the weekend has been rejected by the parties of the opposition,
the unions and welfare associations.  The experts for social policy of the SPD
and The Greens cautioned against an increase of old-age poverty if the pension
levels were decreased from 70% to 64% [of a person's last salary] by 2015, as
called for in the bill.  The social welfare organization VdK threatened to
bring the case before the Federal Constitutional Court if today's retirees
face cuts.

On the eve of a Coalition meeting with Chancellor Kohl tomorrow, the
leaderships of FDP and CDU/CSU have welcomed the bill which would ensure that
pension contributions remain below 20% in the long term.  FDP chairman
Mr. Gerhard, however, warned that his party would not agree to a mere shifting
of cost in which the pension contributions are lessened, but at the same time
consumer taxes would have to be raised.

of employee-paid welfare contributions already by July 1.  FDP politicians,
however, cautioned against giving up the Coalition's tax proposal and called

necessary to meet the stability criteria for the European Monetary Union.

case that Germany could not meet the conditions.

thousands of new jobs could be created, Mr. Hundt told the magazine "Stern".

government money.  This would lower the burden on the public purses which
otherwise would have to issue full welfare payments for these people.

military service because of religious reasons.  In Russia and former
Yugoslavia as well, conscientious objectors have no legal protection.

not save only DM 10 billion for a terminal nuclear storage facility, but a
total of DM 55 billion.  If these tax exempt savings were abandoned, electric
bills could plunge by up to 10 to 12 per cent.

Drug programs threatened by budget austerity measures
</H1>
 Addiction experts consider the aid for drug addicts in jeopardy under
budget cuts.  At the National Drug Convention in Erfurt, experts cautioned
against a reduction of the capacity of rehabilitation facilities.  About 750
of a total of 5,000 therapy spaces could be cut, because the Federal
Government and the Health Insurers are slashing funds.  The Professional
Association for Drugs estimates that 2.5 million people in Germany are alcohol
addicted.  About 300,000 people in Germany are addicted to illegal drugs.  Out
of DM 28 billion in revenue from alcohol and tobacco taxes, the government
spends only DM 30 million for the battle against addiction, the association
explained.
