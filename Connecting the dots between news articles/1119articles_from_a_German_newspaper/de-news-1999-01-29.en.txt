Still no results at award-talks
</H1>
Award-talks in the metal industry and the public service have not got any
closer to reaching an agreement. All over Germany some 150,000 metal
workers downed tools today for a short while, following an appeal by their
union. These actions are to be extended next week, according to deputy
union leader Peters, in case the employers did not come up with a new offer
at the beginning of next week. So far they had offered 2% more pay, while
the union was asking for 6.5%.

<P>
In Stuttgart the first round of award-talks for the public service broke
up without any result. The union wants 5.5% more pay, while representatives
of federal, state and communal employers have not made an offer so far.

New prospective NATO-members
</H1>
Now NATO has formally invited Hungary, Poland and Chechia to apply for
membership. NATO General Secretary Solana wrote a letter to the respective
foreign ministers telling them that the existing members had ratified
the 'eastward' extension of NATO. Now it was up to them to apply in
Washington. Poland's prime minister declared this was an important day
for Poland, and also mentioned that he had been expecting this invitation
for months.

Mr Schroeder's plans draw criticism
</H1>
Following the ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) on the treatment of families, the debate about
how to implement the ruling and pay for it, still rages on. Both SPD and
Finance Minister were critical about Mr Schroeder's proposal to scrap family
benefits for high earners. The Finance Minister, however, ruled out
retroactive measures for families with children before the year 2000. The
chance of complaints against tax assessments based on the recent court ruling
therefore would be nil.

Traffic Council against using a mobile phone while driving
</H1>
According to the German Traffic Council driving while on a mobile phone
should be banned. The Council recommended during their last meeting in
Goslar that mobile phones in cars should only be used provided drivers
used accessories that allowed them to keep their hands on the wheel.
According to latest estimates there are approximately 13 million mobile
phones in Germany. Their numbers are poised to rise to some 40 millions
within the next 10 years
