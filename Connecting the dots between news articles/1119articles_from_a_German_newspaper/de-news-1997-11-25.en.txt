Final debate of 1998 budget bill
</H1>
The coalition government and the opposition continue to strongly
disapprove each other's tax and financial policies. At the beginning of the
final, four-day long reading of the 1998 budget bill and of an amendment to
the 1997 budget, the SPD turned down Finance Minister Theo Waigel's offer
to reenter negotiations on tax and pension reforms. Later, the parliament
rejected, with the votes of the coalition parties, the pension reform
proposal of the Mediation Committee [of Bundestag and Bundesrat, the lower
and upper house of the parliament], as was to be expected.

<P>
In the budget debate, Mr Waigel defended his financial policies that, in
his opinion, assured the adherence to the [Maastricht] criteria for taking
part in the European Monetary Union. The Finance Minister called on the
opposition to stop their "populistic blockade" [in the Bundesrat]. Within
24 hours it was possible [with the SPD's help] to pass a tax and
pension reform thus triggering off a "fire work" of investments. He
also reproached the SPD for not having contributed yet to the modernisation
of the economy -- not politics had failed, but the SPD.

<P>
On the contrary, the opposition called the [government's] policies failed.
The financial policy [of the government] was sort of a delayed
declaration of insolvency to deceive the electorate. SPD budget expert
Karl Diller reproached Theo Waigel for having drawn up a budget that
violates the constitution. According to Mr Diller "creative accounting"
has been used to gloss over the budget, in particular by hiding part of
the deficit as borrowing of the Reconstruction Loan Corporation. The
government was ransacking federal property and, at the same time,
postponing financial burdens to the future.

<P>
The government has drawn up a budget bill for next year over a total of
DM457bn, including new borrowing to the amount of DM56bn. To recompensate
for the lowering of the solidarity surcharge [on income tax] pushed
through by the FDP, the repayment of several billions of debts of former
East-Germany will be postponed [to an unspecified time].

No increase of spending on education after student protests
</H1>
Even with the support of the continuing student protests, the FDP
did not succeed in pushing through a spending increase on education
in next year's budget. According to CSU secretary-general Bernd
Protzner the projected 1998 budget for the Education Ministry will
remain to be some DM14.9bn. The FDP had demanded on increase by
DM70 million to DM15.0bn. In the meantime, the SPD demanded an increase
by DM400 million, DM250 million of which should be spent on the
construction of new university buildings.

<P>
Meanwhile, Federal Education Minister Juergen Ruettgers annouced the
government will provide university libraries with extra funds within
a special programme. University libraries will get some DM80 million
over the next two years, one half payed for each by the federal
government and by the individual states.

<P>
The boycott of lectures [by students] at German universities widened
today, including now 23 institutions. The biggest demonstration by
students took place in Frankfurt/Main where some 10,000 people
protested against the [bad] study facilities.

Seehofer against regionalisation of social security funds
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU) refused again
his party's proposal to "regionalise" social security payments. At a
health policy event in Bonn, Mr Seehofer said the principals of the
social security system were the foundations of the social peace in
Germany. Each [social security] fund and each federal state had
already profited from the "solidarity principle" [providing for
transfers from richer to poorer funds or states]. The Health
Minister especially cited the particular situation of the New States
[of the former East-Germany] as reason for his refusal [of the
proposal]. These states shall not be left alone sorting out problems
for which they are not responsible. Earlier, Federal Labour Minister
Norbert Bluem had already criticised the CSU proposal that called
for linking the social security payments to the economic power of
the individual states.

Motions to SPD party congress presented
</H1>
At their party congress next week in Hanover, the Social Democrats
will set the course for the 1998 general elections. At the presentation
of the [party leaders'] motions to the party congress, the SPD
secretary-general, Mr Muentefehring, said the meeting shall give
guidance for the party as well as for the general public. The main
motion "Innovation for Germany" pins down the general direction of
SPD's economic and social policies.

Germany to intensify economic cooperation with Kazakhstan
</H1>
Germany wants to intensify the economic cooperation with
Kazakhstan. At a meeting with the Kazakhian President, Mr Nasarbajev,
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl underlined the increased interest of
German companies to engage themselves in the Central-Asian republic.
To this respect, however, it was necessary to improve the general
conditions for direct investments.

<P>
At a dinner at Villa Hammerschmidt, German President Roman Herzog
stressed Kazakhtan's richness in mineral resources and promissed
German help for their development and marketing.

Crashed freight train was too fast
</H1>
The train that crashed in the station of Elsterwerda was going
at twice the speed allowed there. According to the Senior Public
Prosecutor's office in Cottbus, the investigations have yielded that
the speed of the train at the moment of the crash was 80 km/h. The
speed limit at the switch where the accident happend was 40 km/h,
though. At the accident last Thursday, 15 tank wagons derailed and two
of them exploded. According to the authorities it is still unclear
whether the accident was caused by a human error or technical failure.
Two of the tracks connecting Berlin to Chemnitz and Dresden were
reopened today.

Meeting of State Premiers on budget cuts on Friday
</H1>
The State Premiers of all 16 German states will meet on Friday
in Bonn to discuss joint austerity measures. This has been communicated
by Baden-Wuerttemberg's Premier Erwin Teufel who had initiated the meeting.
Given the latest tax forecast predicting a further decline in revenues
the states could not just continue with their daily schedule. He in
particular was eager to find out whether there was a serious commitment
from all states to discuss budget cuts in say the staff sector.

Stoiber and Biedenkopf for structural changes of social security
</H1>
The States of Bavaria and Saxonia favourise a stronger
regionalisation of the social security systems. After a joint
meeting of both cabinetts, Bavarian State Premier Edmund Stoiber
said this [the regionalisation] was in particular possible for
unemployment and health insurance schemes. Mr Stoiber and his
Saxonian collegue Kurt Biedenkopf strongly stressed the necessity
for comprehensive reforms of state and society.

<P>
Both cabinetts had discussed the final report of the joint "future
commission". The commission recommends politicians a double
strategy of renovation and adaptation. The aim of politics had
to be to enable the people to act as entrepreneur marketing their
professional skills and shopping for social security needs.
In the future, the state social security system will only provide
for the basic needs, no longer protecting the living standard.
