American Nazi sentenced to four years in prison
</H1>
The Hamburg Regional Court has convicted the American Neo-Nazi Gary Lauck to a
four year prison sentence.  The judge pronounced the 43-year-old Lauck guilty
of instigating racial hatred, among other things.  In 1974, Lauck had
established an NSDAP [National Socialist Workers' Party of Germany - Hitler's
Nazi party] organization in U.S. exile, in cooperation with German and
U.S. right-wing extremists.  From there, he mailed illicit books, swastika,
and SS emblems to Germany.  In his propaganda material, he also called for
attacks on Bonn politicians.  Last year, Lauck was arrested in Denmark and
extradited to Hamburg.  The federal government and members of the SPD
opposition welcomed the verdict.  Minister of the Interior Kanther called
Lauck a mastermind of international Neo-Nazism.  The SPD deputy chair,
Ms. Daeubler-Gmelin, emphasized that now one of the worst right extremist
agitators has been convicted.

Testimony of former Iranian President Bani-Sadr in Mykonos trial
</H1>
With tight security measures in place, the interrogation of the former Iranian
President Bani-Sadr in the so-called "Mykonos" trial has commenced before the
Berlin Higher Court.  Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, who lives in exile in Paris, had
announced he would repeat under oath the accusation that Iran was responsible
for the attack on three Kurdish Iranian oppositional politicians and their
interpreter.  They had been killed in the Berlin restaurant "Mykonos" in
September 1992.  One Iranian national and four Lebanese nationals are accused
of the crime and are standing trial.  This morning on Deutschlandradio Berlin,
Bani-Sadr referred to the religious background of the attack.  Without a
ruling by a religious authority, no Muslim is allowed to kill somebody.  In a
political context, the government has to agree to such a plan.  In the witness
stand Bani-Sadr said the order for the assassination of the oppositional
politicians could only have been given by the religious leader Khomeini.  A
concrete order for murder would also have had to be approved by President
Rafsanjani.  Khomeini controlled two political organizations which planned and
carried out political assassinations.  During the testimony, the area around
the Criminal Court of Moabit was secured by police officers equipped with
machine guns and bulletproof vests.  The street in front of the court's main
entrance was closed.

Lafontaine opposes cutting ABM positions
</H1>
The SPD chairman Lafontaine has demanded to forgo cutting ABM positions
["job-providing measures", government-subsidized jobs] in East Germany.  On
Deutschlandfunk radio, Lafontaine said that this was necessary, given the high
unemployment in the New States.  He furthermore advocated continued financial
support for industrial reconstruction.  In the newspaper "Koelner Express", he
emphasized his party's opposition to parts of Bonn's austerity package.  He
conceded, however, that given the government's majority in the Bundestag, the
laws not requiring the approval of the Bundesrat [the upper house of
parliament, controlled by an SPD majority] could be passed against the votes
of the Opposition.  In the CDU/CSU parliamentary group, the quarrel about
cutting ABM jobs continues smoldering.  The spokesman of the East German
representatives, Mr. Krueger, does not rule out that members of his group
might oppose the 1997 federal budget because of this controversy.  This could
occur if the government stuck to the savings of 1.7 billion DM in
job-providing measures (ABM) in the New States, Krueger told the "Lausitzer
Runschau" newspaper, Cottbus.

Hensch comments on the conflict between Saxony and the EU
</H1>
The President of the European Parliament, Mr. Hensch, does not see signs for a
novel German policy regarding Europe, despite the conflict between the State
of Saxony and the EU.  On Deutschlandfunk radio this morning, Hensch
considered the process of fighting out differences with the European Union,
even if in court, as normal.  The SPD representative added, however, that it
had not been prudent of Saxony to pay unauthorized subsidies to the Volkswagen
Corporation.  At the same time, Hensch defended EU Commissioner Mr. van Miert
who would not at all neglect Germany's interests.  In the meantime, van Miert
ruled out Brussels' giving in on the debate about financial aid to VW.  He
told the newspaper "Hamburger Abendblatt" that if Germany does not submit to
EU authority in this question, the Commission would file for a lawsuit at the
European High Court as soon as possible.

German economy on growth course
</H1>
In the opinion of the Ministry of Economics, the German economy is slowly
coming back to course of growth.  However, this does not yet have an effect on
the job market, as it says in the Ministry's report about the current economic
situation, published in Bonn today.  In the second quarter of this year, the
gross national product grew significantly compared to the first quarter of
1996, and was about 1% higher than the figure one year ago.  Especially in
processing industries, demand has risen.  In contrast to industry, the
construction sector continues its downtrend.

Third short term interest rate lowered
</H1>
The Bundesbank [Central Bank] has lowered the third key short term interest
rate, the repurchase rate.  This was announced following the Central Bank
Council's first meeting after the summer break in Frankfurt/Main.  The
interest rate was decreased from 3.3% to 3.0%.  The repurchase rate applies
for short-term loans that the Bundesbank offers to commercial banks.  The
Central Bank Council left the discount and lombard rates unchanged at 2.5% and
4.5%, respectively.  The government, bank associations and the stock markets
reacted positively to the Bundesbank's decision.  A spokesman at the Finance
Ministry said in Bonn that the Bank Council has utilized financial leeway.
The Ministry of Economics emphasized that the measure fits well into the
picture of current economic trend.  The National Banks of France, Belgium, and
Austria have lowered some of their interest rates as well.

Bargaining talks in retail industry unsuccessful

80,000 employees, no progress had been made in the controversial question
about bonuses for extended store hours.  The talks in Bavaria did not seem to
yield an agreement either.
