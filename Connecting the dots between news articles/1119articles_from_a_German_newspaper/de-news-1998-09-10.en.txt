Closing statement of Bavarian Greens
</H1>
At the end of the Bavarian State Parliament election campaign the
Greens accused the CSU of politics of broken promises. Top candidate
Ruth Paulick said the government neither reduced the number of
unemployed persons in Bavaria by half, nor helped the environment.
Greens' Parliamentary Leader Fischer warned against voting for splinter
groups which could all fail the 5 per cent hurdle. The CSU and SPD
parties as the only representatives in the new State Parliament could
only have negative effects on Bavaria.

Award for Steven Spielberg
</H1>
Hollywood film director Steven Spielberg received Germany's highest
civilian Order of Merit, the "Grosses Bundesverdienstkreuz", this
afternoon at Schloss Bellevue in Berlin. President Herzog recognized
Spielberg's contribution to reconditioning the Holocaust with his
film "Schindler's List". Another reason for the award is the
so-called Shoa Project which Spielberg supports with profits from
his film. The project's goal is to capture the remembrance of the
Holocaust of several ten thousand survivors on video.
