Krupp-Hoesch-Concern wants to take over Thyssen
</H1>
The Krupp-Hoesch-Concern evidently wants to take over Thyssen AG. Thyssen
will resist the hostile take-over using all possible juridical means,
informed Mr. Vogel, chief of Thyssen AG in Duesseldorf today. He accused the
Essen-based competitor of using wild-west methods. Vogel demanded that such
acquisitions by such financially inadequate corporations as Krupp-Hoesch
should invariably be prevented. The reason for the interest is clear: Unlike
Krupp, at Thyssen only 18.6 percent of the shares are privately owned. If
someone brought in about DM8-9 billion in this situation, they could
make such a profitable offer to the 140.000 free stockholders of Thyssen,
that a majority could be reached. The question is, how would Krupp finance
such a move, as it took the company 5 years to recover from buying Hoesch.
It would have to separate from some of the Thyssen property. This would lead
to radical consolidation of the steel industry, to massive lay-offs and
even to the closure entire facilities.

Protests against the planned take-over of Thyssen
</H1>
The employees of both companies, too, responded to the plan by protesting.
Already in the morning several thousand steel workers demonstrated in Essen.
This brought roughly half the steel production of Thyssen to a stop. The
chairman of Krupp-Hoesch, Mr. Kromme stated that the reason for the
take-over is that this would offer an opportunity for an internationally
competitive position.

<P>
He said there was no plan to close any facilities. Instead, Krupp-Hoesch
would strive for optimized manufacturing processes. The Duisburg metal
workers' union  called Kromme "job ruiner number one in the Ruhr area".
State Premier
of North Rhine-Westphalia Johannes Rau emphasized that the regional
government cannot approve the planned take-over. According to Krupp's own
announcement, Thyssen-stockholders will be payed DM435 for each share by
Krupp-Hoesch. That is about DM100 more than the latest stock rate. The
trading of the shares was suspended today.
