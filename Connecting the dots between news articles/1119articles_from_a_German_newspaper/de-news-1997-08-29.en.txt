Compromise for 'Big Bug Attack' strategy
</H1>
This morning coalition parties and the SPD presented a common strategy
for the so-called Big Bug Attack, and the Minister of Justice liked very
much what he saw. This is intended to fight organised crime. Mr Schily, of
the SPD, said that the compromise made sense. The bugging dwellings would
be subject to strict controls by the courts and parliament. He also welcomed
the much enhanced possibilities to seize assets acquired through proceeds
from criminal activities. Minister Kanther stated that he expected the draft
to be passed into law shortly, and also thought that the law would have no
problem getting the required majority for a change of the constitution.

Pension Scheme urges reform of pension system
</H1>
The Federal Pension System for Employees (BfA) appealed to
government and the opposition SPD to come to the party and agree on the
reform of the pensions. In an interview with a newspaper, director Michaelis
said that 18 million pensioners and 35 million employees were entitled to
a compromise in such an important matter, across floors and parties. First
of all, the federal subsidy would have to be raised by 15 billion marks, as
quickly as possible, so the Pension System would get into the black again.

More flexible working-hours for federal public servants
</H1>
The approx. 760,000 federal public servants are to be more in control
of their working-hours, in the future, though there is no question of them
getting more spare time. Minister for Internal Affairs Kanther refuted a
claim by tabloid BILD that public servants' working-hours are to be
lowered, whereas their breaks (morning-tea, lunch and afternoon-tea?) were to
be extended. The goal of the planned reform was to add flexibility to
the public service. In the future they should be able to take some hours or
days off 'in lieu' (instead of getting paid for over-time). Mr Kanther
confirmed that federal public servants already had Christmas Eve and New
Year's Eve off, but had lost two other holidays to make up for it. They will
keep working 38.5 hours/week.
