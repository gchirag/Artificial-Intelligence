</H1>
The EU Commission has warned the European Parliament not to withhold the
exoneration for the 1996 budget year. The night before the vote in
Strasbourg the Commission presented a statement saying that the authority
and credibility of the Commission were at a stake. This was especially
important because the reform package "Agenda 2000" depended on future
important joint decisions. A large number of members of the European
Parliament had announced they would not exonerate the Commission because of
the latest financial scandals and the criticism by the European Court of
Auditors of the Commission's financial management.
