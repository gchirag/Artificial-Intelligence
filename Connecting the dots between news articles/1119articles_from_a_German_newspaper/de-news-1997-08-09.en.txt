Discussion concerning continuation of conscription expanded
</H1>
The discussion concerning conscription is expanding.  The deputy
head of the FDP, Ms. Pieper was critical on Saturday of the poll of
members of her party concerning the future of conscription.  She
told the news agency ddp/adn that the debate was interesting in
theory to be sure but was being held at the wrong point in time.
Ms. Pieper pointed out that the armed forces had performed
magnificently during the past few weeks in the flood areas of the
Oder.  Federal Chancellor Kohl stated on Friday that he favored the
continuation of universal conscription.  Vacationing in St.
Gilgen, Austria, Mr. Kohl said during an RTL interview a government
under his leadership would not abolish conscription.  The head of
the parliamentary committee on defense, Mr. Rosmanit also objected
to structural changes in the armed forces.  The CSU politician told
the DEUTSCHLANDFUNK that conscription had proved itself and was
necessary.  The German Armed Forces Alliance announced a nationwide
campaign against the introduction of a professional army.  Mr.
Meinberg, a member of the executive board of that organization told
the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG that there was no alternative to a
conscripted army in Germany.

Discussion about orthographic reform continues
</H1>
Scholz, the deputy head of the CDU/CSU parliamentary faction
has expressed criticism of the procedures used by the states'
ministers of culture against orthographic reform.  The expert
in constitutional law told the SENDER FREIES BERLIN that the
foundations for training given by the schools should be regulated
by law according to the decisions rendered by the Federal
Constitutional Court and passed by Parliament.  But, he continued,
the  ministers of culture wanted to regulate the reform by the
enactment of the findings of simple consultation.  FDP Secretary
Westerwelle also expressed opposition to orthographic reform.  Not
a single state's parliament had been consulted about the proposed
innovations, Mr. Westerwelle told the news magazine FOCUS.  He
considered this to be unbureaucratic.

Mr. Waigel wants to lower payments to EU by 6 to 7 billion marks
</H1>
Federal Minister for Finance Waigel wants to lower German payments
to the EU by 6 to 7 billion marks per year.  Mr. Waigel told the
news magazine DER SPIEGEL that it could no longer be tolerated that
Germany raises 60 percent of EU expenditures.  He pointed out that
the rules governing aid to structurally weak regions have to be
revised in 1999.  To do this, unanimity is necessary in the EU.
Mr. Waigel emphasized that Bonn would only approve of the package
if it would result in a sharing of the burden which would be more
favorable to Germany.
