Coalition government and SPD to discuss tax reform
</H1>
The governing coalition and the Social Democratic Party are to commence joint
talks about the tax reform before the end of this month. The secretary-general
of the CDU, Mr. Hintze, told the German Press Agency in Bonn that he expected
an offer of talks to be made to the SPD. He said the tax reform represented
the most important project for increased growth and employment. It would be
beneficial to achieve a swift agreement with the states governed by Social
Democrats. Earlier the parliamentary spokesman for the Social Democrats,
Mr. Scharping, announced that the coalition would be invited to talks before
the end of February. The spokesman for the CDU/CSU coalition, Mr. Hoerster,
replied that the coalition would prefer to wait until the draft reform
proposals had been successfully drawn up. This is expected to be some time in
March. The Secretary of the Chancellor's Office, Mr. Bohl, stated that
discussions could begin 3-4 weeks after Easter at the earliest. The Ministry
of Finance has referred back to the Finance Minister Waigel's statement, that
the talks should begin as soon as possible and should include a discussion
about the wage reform planned for next year. Waigel explained yesterday that
some sections of the tax reform could also be implemented in the coming year.

Council of Russian Federation to discuss looted art treasures
</H1>
In Moscow today the Council of the Russian Federation, comprising
representatives of the various regions, will discuss legislation relating to
the art treasures looted from Germany. The parliament has already declared
works of art originating from Germany to be the property of Russia by law. One
of the works in question is the 'golden treasure of Priamos'. If the Federal
Council supports the new proposals, only President Yeltsin will be able to
prevent them from becoming law. The German government has demanded the return
of all works of art taken to the Soviet Union during World War II.
