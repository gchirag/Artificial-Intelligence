Heavy snowfalls cause interruptions
</H1>
Last night's heavy rainfalls obstructed traffic and caused accidents in
many areas. The Black Forest region was hit hardest. Numerous federal
highways between Lake Constance and the Upper Rhine were blocked by skidded
cars standing across the lanes.

Strike approaching in metal industry
</H1>
A strike in the metal industry becomes more and more likely. The fifth
round of collective bargaining talks for about 340000 workers in the metal
industry of southwest Germany has been adjourned without result and without
setting a new date. The employers have also canceled negotiations in other
bargaining districts. Mr. Fritsche, leader of the employers' negotiation
team, said the targets of both parties were too far apart. Mr. Peters,
vice-president of the metal workers union IG Metall reproached the
employers for blocking the negotiations. Yet, the workers would continue to
negotiate even if there was a strike. On Sunday, the leadership of the
union will presumably decide about strike ballots. IG Metall demands wage
increases of 6.5 percent. The employers offer 2.3 percent and a one-time
profit-related payment of up to 0.5 percent of the annual income.
Before today's round of talks there were warning strikes this morning.
About 1000 night-shift workers of the Daimler-Chrysler car factory in
Sindelfingen ended their shift one hour early and the production came to a
halt, according to the workers' council.

Collective bargaining for public service sector postponed
</H1>
In the collective bargaining for the public services, too, there is no sign
of agreement. The employers did not make any offer. The talks were
adjourned until February 26. Herbert Mai, head of public service and
transportation union OeTV, now expects that the employees will take to
warning strikes. He said the second round of talks was disappointing.
Interior Minister Otto Schily who is negotiation leader for the federal
government said he would not agree to anything that could not be financed
realistically. Public service unions OeTV and DAG demand pay rises of 5.5
percent for the public service employees. In the afternoon there was a
summit talk between the three representatives of unions and employers,

SPD striving for compromise in citizenship law
</H1>
The Social-Democrats want to offer the opposition a compromise on the
reform of the citizenship law. SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said after a
meeting of the party executive that the red-green coalition was striving
for a broad majority in both houses of parliament. This should be accounted
for already at the presentation of the bill that is being drafted in the
interior ministry. Mr. Lafontaine did not mention any details. Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder was also supporting a compromise on the citizenship law.
After the defeat of the red-green state government in Hesse, the federal
red-green government can no longer work with a left-wing majority in the
Bundesrat, the upper house of parliament representing the states. This
morning the SPD's faction leader, Mr. Struck, was still saying that he had
not seen any alternative bills by the opposition but just a campaign.
Therefore, he was in favour of sticking to the current draft.

More unemployed
</H1>
The number of officially registered unemployed has increased by 257,000 in
January. Thus, 4.45 million people are jobless. This corresponds to an
increase of 10.9 to 11.5 percent according to the Federal Labour Office.
January last year, however, there were more than 4.8 million unemployed.
President of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said the reason was
a momentary slack in the business activity. If the exterior conditions
remained normal, the number of unemployment could decrease on average by
200,000 this year. The emergency programme set up by the federal government
for unemployed youths had a good start, said Jagoda. By the end of January
almost 6000 young people had found a job through the programme.

Fusion of Justice and Interior Ministries unconstitutional
</H1>
The nationwide first combination of Justice and Interiour Ministries
[to one single ministry] in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia has to be
undone. According to a decision of the state's constitutional court in
Muenster in a case brought by the oppositional CDU, the fusion of the two
ministries violated the rights of the Landtag, the state's parliament.

Hesse to vote for tax reform bill and 630DM-jobs bill now
</H1>
Hesse's State Premier Hans Eichel, voted out of office in last Sunday's
state elections, said that his government has changed its mind and will now
support the federal government's tax reform and 630DM-jobs bills in the
Bundesrat
(upper house of parliament), making it possible to pass the bills in March.
Although his government has been voted out of office last Sunday, it will stay
in office until beginning of April. Then it will be replaced by a new CDU/FDP
coalition government. Mr Eichel's attitude was highly criticised by the
opposition parties in Bonn [ie. CDU/CSU and FDP], reproaching Mr Eichel with
violating the political culture.

Hombach: Progress in compensation talks
</H1>
According to the German Secretary of the Chancellor's Office,
Mr Hombach, the talks about compensation for forced labour convicts during
the Nazi rule in Germany made big progress. It was now time to gain
momentum, said Mr Hombach at a meeting with representatives of the Jewish
World Congress. The General Secretary of the organisation, Mr Singer, called
the talks constructive. The lawyers representing the Holocaust survivors,
however, were sceptical since there was no agreement yet.

Schroeder asks for mercy for two Germans sentenced to death in US
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has asked the USA for mercy
for two Germans that have been sentenced to death. According to the
news magazine "Stern", Mr Schroeder has asked President Bill Clinton and
the governor of Arizona to replace the death sentence for two brothers
to imprisonment for live. Mr Schroeder said, as a fundamental opponent
of the death sentence, he believed that even for the most serious crimes
live-long imprisonment was the appropriate atonement.

<P>
The two brothers had been found guilty to have killed a bank manager
at a hold up 17 years ago.
