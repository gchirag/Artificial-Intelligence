FDP convention in Berlin
</H1>
During their special convention today [Sunday] in Berlin, the Free
Democratic Party (FDP) is determining their tax policy for the upcoming
parliamentary elections. The motion put forward by  party leadership
envisions lowering taxes for individuals and businesses in all tax
brackets. The goal is to provide a net relief of 30 billion marks. The
FDP plans to discuss their entire election program during another
convention at the end of June. FDP president Mr. Gerhardt sharply
criticized both the Green Party and the Social Democrats (SPD) when he
introduced the FDP's tax program and said that the SPD could not hide the
fact that it has developed into the most conservative social democratic
party in all of Europe. The FDP's coalition partner, the Christian
Democratic Union (CDU), also received harsh criticism. As far as economic
reform and relief of the citizens is concerned, things are not the best
with the CDU, either, Mr. Gerhardt said.

Green Party sticks to election program
</H1>
The Green Party will stick to its controversial election program.
After a crisis meeting of the national and state directors of Alliance
90/The Greens, the Chairwoman of the Executive Board Gunda Roestel said
today [Sunday] in Berlin that the election program will not be revised.
Instead, the most important social political goals for the coming
legislative period will be put together in a short version of the
program. Ms. Roestel did not comment on concrete points of the paper
which is scheduled to be adopted during a convention in June. She only
said that the demand to increase the price of gas price to 5 marks will
not be in that program because it only covers the next four years. Ms.
Roestel and her colleague Mr. Trittin are optimistic that the Greens will
be voted into the State Parliament Saxony-Anhalt next Sunday. According
to an "Infas" poll published today, projects that the Greens will receive
less than five percent of the vote in Saxony-Anhalt.
