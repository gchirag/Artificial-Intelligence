German government wants to give more support to the Yugoslav opposition
</H1>
The German government wants to give more support to the Yugoslav
opposition.  A spokesman for the foreign ministry said that, according to
trustworthy sources, there will be further discussions with Serbian
opposition politicians in the next few weeks.  The goal is for President
Milosevic to step down.  Opposition leader Zoran Djindjic has called for
mass demonstrations in Yugoslavia.  He says millions of people must take
to the streets and demonstrate against Milosevic.  According to a report
in "Die Welt am Sonntag," Djindjic will appear in Belgrade before a court
that has issued a warrant for his arrest.  He said he was anxious over
whether the authorities would risk arresting him.

Health care policy discussions
</H1>
According to "Der Spiegel," the government wants to meet with insurance
companies and doctors' unions to develop a common position on health care
policy.  The doctors' representatives would agree to such a suggestion if
it came from Gerhard Schroeder.  And so long as there were negotiations,
doctors would desist from protest actions against health care reform.

Minister President Beck suggests a year of zero wage growth
</H1>
The Chairman of the SPD parliamentary group wants to discuss the so-called
"zero-growth" proposal made by Kurt Beck, the SPD Minister President of
Rheinland-Pfalz, to the Alliance for Jobs.  This was reported by "Bild am
Sonntag."  The politicians have already agreed to a year of zero wage
growth for themselves.  They think that federal employees, like
pensioners, should only receive a raise sufficient to offset inflation.

<P>
The Union of Public Service and Transport Workers (OeTV) announced that
protests will take place if the zero-growth proposal goes through.
Hans-Olaf Henkel, the president of the Federal Association of Industrial
Workers (BDI), also criticized Beck.  He said the proposal didn't exactly
build trust in the Alliance for Jobs.

<P>
Otto Schily, the Federal Interior Minister, said that the strained budget
situation at the federal, state and local level will naturally affect wage
negotiations.  Werner Mueller, the Federal Economics Minister, warned the
negotiating parties to show restraint.  On "ZDF" Mueller said that, if the
government lowers taxes and social contributions so that the average net
wage packet increases by 3000 DM within the next four years, this should
be taken into account in when making wage demands.  On the other hand, he
said that there was also room for higher net wages, because when taxes and
social contributions have being reduced, a nominally higher wage could be
introduced that would not in fact be more expensive for employers.

Pension levels under 67 percent
</H1>
The government's pension plans are still being argued over.  According to
a report in "Focus" magazine, the pension level in the coming years will
fall to less than previously put forth.  Calculations show pension levels
of under 67 percent for many seniors.  It remains uncertain whether the
SPD and the CDU/CSU will convene a pension summit any time soon.  Edmund
Stoiber, the Bavarian Minister President, rejected such a summit in the
present situation.  At the regional party conference in Upper Franconia
held in Hof on the Saale, Stoiber also accused the government of
discriminating against the South.  As examples, Stoiber gave the no vote
on constructing a high speed (ICE) train line between Nuremberg and
Erfurt, and the reduction in support for the arts.  At the same time he
renewed his criticism of the inter-state equalization fund.  He said
strong competition between states is necessary for Germany's development.

Cuts in the military budget
</H1>
Even the army has to economize.  The Defense Minister, Rudolph Scharping,
has made it clear that he is willing to bear his share of the cuts
proposed by Finance Minister Hans Eichel.  Scharping explained in an
interview that despite the increasing demands being put on it, for example
in the Balkans, the defense budget cannot escape from the economic
pressures being felt by the state as a whole.  Previously the chairman of
the CDU, Wolfgang Schauble, accused Scharping of not standing up enough
for the interests of the soldiers.  Schauble said that in light of new
undertakings, the military simply cannot cut 18 billion marks in four
years.

</H1>
Elementary school children in Baden-Wuerttemberg are to begin learning
foreign languages as of the 2000/2001 school year.  This was announced by
Erwin Teufel, the Minister President of Baden Wuerttemberg, to an
educational congress of the CDU in Esslingen.  Teufel said that knowledge
of foreign languages is becoming more and more important.  He also said
that English should no longer be prescribed as the first foreign language.
French should also be offered, especially so close to the French border.
