Annual synod of German Protestant Church
</H1>
The Protestant Church in Germany is calling upon the federal government for
more social justice in its policies. The chairman of church council, Manfred
Kock, opened the meeting with a speech criticizing the lack of the impetus
that had been promised in the fight against unemployment. He called for
social balance in federal austerity measures, saying that however necessary
that measures are, they must not hit the unemployed and those with low
incomes particularly hard. Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder had
previously promoted his government's austerity program among the 120 synod
members. He described church fears of growing social injustice as unfounded.
In Leipzig, Schroeder said that the SPD-Green savings measures would not be
realized solely on the back of society's weaker members.
The major topics of discussion at the synod are: missionary work, the 2000
Church budget, and pregnancy counselling.

Health reform: CDU counter-proposal
</H1>
The CDU has announced a counter-proposal to Federal Health Minister Andrea
Fischer's plans for health reform. According to a report in the "Welt am
Sonntag" newspaper, the proposal is to be formally approved by the
opposition party's federal executive tomorrow. The core of the plan is
apparently to increase the responsibility of patients for their own care,
and not to cover every health risk through the public health insurance
schemes. This would allow people to decide for themselves how much coverage
they wanted. The proposal also provides for a bonus system for
health-conscious behaviour on the part of consumers. The thinking behind the
plan: if no one is willing to shoulder small risks and to pay modest
deductibles themselves, then at some point there may not be enough money
left in the system for necessary services.

Coalition talks in Berlin
</H1>
This afternoon, the CDU and the SPD began negotiations on a renewal of the
so-called Grand Coalition they have shared since 1991. Berlin Mayor Eberhard
Diepgen said the talks would be conducted at a rapid pace, so that a viable
government could be formed as early as December. The leader of the state
SPD, Peter Strieder, said he expected the talks to open in a positive
atmosphere.
Today's meeting will be used to establish a schedule and agenda for the
topics to be discussed. The primary bone of contention between the CDU and
the SPD in Berlin is the filling of the Senator positions [the official,
historical name for Ministers in the city-state].
In the state elections on October 10, the SPD suffered its worst results in
Berlin since World War II. The CDU was the clear victor, with 40.8 percent
of the vote.

Mueller accommodates Western power companies
</H1>
Federal Economic Minister Werner Mueller is apparently willing to greatly
accommodate Western power companies in their bid to purchase the Eastern
power company Veag. According to a report in the "Berliner Zeitung"
newspaper, the independent minister wants to waive the second part of the
purchase price, approximately 2 billion DM, for the Western German Veag
owners. The sum would normally be due in 2013 and would actually be paid
directly to the federal administration. According to the newspaper report,
Mueller is willing to do without that income entirely, if the Veag owners
commit themselves to keeping the Eastern German power company, with its
15,000 employees, alive.

businesses. It is complaining about lost revenue in the amount of 160
million DM through unpaid sex-hotline calls. It also considers its image
endangered.

several courts ruled the business dealings with sex-lines to violate
community standards (Sittenwidrigkeit).

Foreign Office rejects report on arms exports
</H1>

further approvals for weapons exports. It said that, contrary to the report,
the Federal Security Council had clearly refused the delivery of tank
machinery to Pakistan.
The "Berliner Morgenpost" newspaper has also written that the federal
government had approved the delivery of 32 fighter planes and 2 submarines
to the United Arab Emirates. The Foreign Office had no comment.
