Waigel presents radical tax reform
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel wants to reorganize the tax
system radically in case of a victory of CDU/CSU in the general elections
in September. To this respect, Mr Waigel presented his concept today
leading to a complete reorganization by the year 2010. At the end, there
will not be anymore any taxes the revenues of which are split between the
Federal state and the 16 individual (German) states. According to
Mr Waigel's plans, all revenues from indirect taxes such as value added
tax will go to the Federal state. On the other hand, revenues from direct
taxes such as income taxes and death duties will benefit the individual
states. The individual states will also get the right to set rate for
income and cooperate taxes.

<P>
With the first step of this reform that is scheduled for as early as 1999,
the Finance Minister intends to increase "taxing fairness". The main aim
of the reform will be a higher economic growth, the creation of new jobs
as well as a more effective use of economic potentials. It was possible
to lower taxes by a total of DM30 billion. The annual growth of state
spending should remain below 2%, and the part of state spending in the
GNP should fall from 48% now to 46% in two years.

<P>
The Social Democrats (SPD) reproached Mr Waigel with not even having
presented a tax revenue forecast. SPD finanical expert Ingrid
Matthaeus-Maier called Mr Waigel's concept socially unfair and
politically not enforceable.

In Mai, the number of bankruptcies has increased slightly once
again. According to the Federal Department of Statistics, the number of
insolvencies went up to 2800, a rise of 1.6% compared with the previous
month.  Especially small businesses and small trade enterprises had to file
for bankruptcy.  Compared to the first half of 1998, there were almost
8 percent more cases of insolvencies. It seems like Germany is going to set
up a new record of bankruptcies this year. Especially East Germany has been
affected by this.

Environmental conservation groups cancel cooperation with government
</H1>
The two biggest environmental conservation groups [in Germany]
have cancelled their collaboration in the 'Umweltdialog' (environmental dialogue)
initiated by the government of the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg. The ministry of
the environment does regret the withdrawal and called it a rash and
nonunderstandable decision. The CDU faction in the state's parliament called
the groups' decision an overreaction. According to the Social Democrats (SPD),
it was a consequent decision since the dialogue has been very unsatisfactory so
far. BUND and NABU, the two environmental conservation groups, explained their
withdrawal as being the result of choosing the wrong topics for the dialogues
and also for partly trying to prepare a reduction of environmental standards.
