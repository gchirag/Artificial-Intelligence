Daeubler-Gmelin accuses Kohl of criminal behaviour
</H1>
Federal Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin is accusing former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl of intentional breach of the law. She told the "Berliner
Zeitung" newspaper that Kohl has been acting in defiance of the law for
years. She also condemned the former German leader's incremental admissions.
The spokesman for the CDU/CSU in the Bundestag committee investigating the
CDU donation affair, Andreas Schmidt, has begun defending Kohl. Schmidt said
it was mean and brutal for SPD members within the committee to threaten
having Kohl placed under police custody. He added that it was only
appropriate to wait and hear what Kohl would say in his testimony. The SPD
chairman of the committee, Volker Neumann, said that the law provides for
fines or even detention in cases in which a witness does not have the right
to refuse to give evidence but does refuse anyway. Kohl admitted in an
interview on ZDF television last Thursday that he had accepted cash from
donors, but he repeatedly made clear in the following days that he had no
intention of naming names.
Meanwhile, new details have come to light concerning the Leuna affair, which
the committee is also to investigate. Today's "Welt" newspaper reports that
in the sale of the East German Leuna refinery to the French petroleum
company Elf-Aquitaine, bribes were paid to individuals connected with the
Treuhand [trust administration established following German reunification to
oversee the privatization of firms formerly owned by the East German
government]. It is expected that those funds were used to cover phony
investment plans, in order to acquire federal subsidies worth billions of
D-Marks.

Withdrawal from nuclear power
</H1>
The German power companies continue to reject an overall 30-year lifespan
for nuclear power plants. The president of the Union of German Power Plants,
Heinz Klinger, said that that period, as demanded by the Green Party, would
not allow the plants economic viability. He said a reactor must be on-line
for at least 35 years. He indicated that the reactors in question were in
working order, and that it would be nothing short of the destruction of
capital to shut them down.

Weather disrupts traffic
</H1>
Heavy snowfall and black ice led to serious traffic problems in much of
Germany. Sixteen people died in collisions. The states of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and the Saarland were especially
affected. Fallen trees blocked roads and rail lines. On the autobahn
encircling Karlsruhe alone there have been almost 60 collisions since
yesterday, injuring nine people. The airports in Stuttgart, Frankfurt, and
Munich had to delay many flights for several hours, or cancel them
altogether. In the meantime, the situation has generally eased. Falling
temperatures overnight, however, mean that black ice continues to be a
serious danger.
