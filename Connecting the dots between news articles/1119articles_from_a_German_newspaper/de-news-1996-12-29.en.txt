Coldest weekend of the year
</H1>
This weekend is the coldest of the year in Germany. Last night,
temperatures in Erfurt dropped to -24 degrees Celsius. In
Baden-Wuerttemberg a record set in Freudenstadt with -18 C. Meteorologists
forecast that it will be slightly less frosty tonight. This morning, snow
and drizzle in northern Germany turned roads dangerously slippery. Sanding
vehicles have been at work without a break.
Physicians warn against carrying children on one's back for a longer time.
Bad blood circulation in the child's bent legs in connection with low
temperatures could cause frozen legs. Also, shoes should not be tied too
tightly.

Employer president Hundt views strikes and lock-outs as old-fashioned
</H1>
New president of the federal union of employers associations Dieter Hundt
advocated new models of conflict resolution in the collective bargaining
process to avoid labour disputes. Strikes and lock-outs were no longer
up-to-date, Hundt said in an interview with news agency DPA. A positive
example was the Swiss 'Peace Accord' model that stipulates arbitration
without strikes. The bargaining partners have agreed on renouncing all
labour dispute actions. Hundt said trade unions and employers should look
for new regulations on the occasion of negotiating the reform of regional
bargaining agreements.

construction workers German minimum wages.

Churches count on social market economy
</H1>
The Catholic and Protestant Churches warn against increasing poverty in
Germany and count on social market economy. Mr. Langendorfer, Secretary of
the German Conference of Bishops, said on Suedwestfunk radio the joint
declaration of the churches on the economic and social situation in Germany
includes a call for the continuing development of social market economy.
This also includes the protection of the environment. The social document
of the churches will be presented in February. Langendorfer predicted that
the declaration will hurt all parts of society because the churches will
not participate in the common blame-the-other game.

Public TV station ZDF on the way out of financial depression
</H1>
Public TV station ZDF seems to have passed the financial drought. In the
past four years revenues from commercials have declined by DM1.7 billion.
ZDF director Stolte admitted in the weekly Welt am Sonntag that the
programming had suffered under the lack of money, but this would change
now. Next year, ZDF will spend DM50 million on entertainment. The station
will also more than halve its debts. The money will come from an increase
of licence fees [paid by all TV set owners] and from slowly increasing
revenues from commercials. As a further step to reduce costs ZDF will cut
about 600 jobs until the year 2000, said Stolpe.
