NATO prepared to intervene in Kosovo
</H1>
NATO has indicated that they are prepared to intervene
militarily in Kosovo, said  NATO Commander-in-Chief for Europe, US
General Clark, at a meeting in Vienna. Commander Clark said that military
action was necessary as the Serbian artillery are continuing shooting at
whole villages. The Albanian Kosova information center in Pristina has
confirmed the attacks, although the Ministry for the Interior in Belgrade
has denied them. German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has repeated that
he is of the opinion that military action in Kosova needs to be ratified
by the UN World Security Council and that Russia would surely change
their current resistance to such a move if attacks escalated. NATO is
currently considering sending ground troops to Albania and Macedonia,
both states bordering on Kosova.

Red-Green coalition only with formal coalition agreement
</H1>
The parliamentary spokesman for the Alliance 90/Greens party
is of the opinion that only a clear coalition agreement can provide a
basis for a possible coalition government with the SPD. Ms. Mueller said
to South German Radio that all possible points of conflict need to be
negotiated in detail if they won the election. An important point, she
continued, would be departing from nuclear energy and that the Green
party had already prepared a program in this regard. She is quoted as
saying "no red-green coalition without commitment to discontinuing
nuclear energy".
