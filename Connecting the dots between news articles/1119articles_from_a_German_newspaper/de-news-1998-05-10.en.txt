Schaeuble accuses SPD of lacking credibility
</H1>
The leader of the CDU and CSU parties in the Bundestag,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, has accused the SPD of lacking credibility in its
relations with the PDS (Party of Democratic Socialism (former communist
party of East Germany)). In an interview with the newspaper "Sonntag
aktuell", Mr. Schaeuble said that in concrete terms, the Social Democrats
had still decided in favor of cooperation with the PDS. He continued that
the federal SPD was only prepared to hold further talks with the CDU in
Saxony-Anhalt because it feared that the Bundestag elections would
otherwise be harmed. Speaking on Bavarian radio, the SPD chancellor
candidate Mr. Schroeder expressed the hope that all doors between the CDU
and SPD in Magdeburg had not yet been slammed shut. At the same time he
warned the CDU against what he termed a new "Red Socks" campaign. The PDS
parliamentary party leader in Saxony-Anhalt, Mr. Sitte, is working on the
assumption that speedy agreement can be reached with the SPD as regards
tolerating a possible minority government. The PDS told the newspaper
"Berliner Morgenpost" that they would make no demands in order to retain
room for maneuvering.
