Trittin calls for consensus in foreign policy
</H1>
The spokesperson for the executive board of the Greens, Mr. Trittin, has
urged his party to speak in one voice in questions of foreign policy. As
Mr. Trittin told the news magazine "Der Spiegel," disputes about foreign
policy are a legacy from role the Green party played in opposition.  Now,
however, the top priority for the Greens is to govern the country
responsibly, Mr. Trittin continued.  Regarding the German position in the
conflict in Kosovo, he said his party would consult closely with the SPD.
According to Mr. Trittin, a military intervention by NATO, including
participation of German troops without a prior UN resolution to that
effect, would raise an innumerable number of problems with international
law.

Lower Saxony SPD agrees on successor to Schroeder
</H1>
The Lower Saxon SPD has nominated the current State Minister of the
Interior, Gerhard Glogowski, to succeed Gerhard Schroeder as Minister
President.  The latter will become federal Chancellor as a result of the
recent federal elections.  About 10 delegates at the state party
convention voted against nominating Glogowski.  On the eve of resuming the
coalition talks between SPD and the Green Alliance, Mr. Schroeder reminded
the Greens that the SPD will naturally claim a larger share of
responsibility and control in the new government's affairs in proportion
to its greater share of the vote -- 40 percent to the Greens' 7.  Mr.
Schroeder added, however, that the negotiations will be conducted in a
constructive atmosphere of mutual respect.

Industry spokesman says environmental taxes are bad for the economy
</H1>
Henkel, the President of the Federal Association of German Industry,
said that he views ecological taxes as a great threat to the labor market.
He cautioned the new government against making such plans into law.  The
incoming red-green coalition has said that it intends to raise the tax on
crude oil by six pfennigs per liter.  Other fuels are to be taxed as well.
However, according to the SPD's executive manager Mr. Muentefering,
certain energy-intensive industries are to receive exemptions.

Automobile manufacturers caution against a federal speed limit
</H1>
The heads of all large German car corporations have warned against a
national speed limit in Germany.  Chairman of Volkswagen Piech told the
news magazine "Focus" that a speed limit would be the worst of both
worlds, a disaster for the economy that would do nothing to improve the
ecosystem.  According to Piech, speed limits in Germany will simply create
jobs in Italy, France and South Korea.  Chairman of BMW Pischetsrieder
said that in the era of electronic traffic flow control, national speed
limits are a prehistoric throwback.  The chairmen also cautioned against a
drastic increase in the crude oil tax.  This would hit the automobile
industry at a sensitive time, they stated in a letter to SPD and the Green
Alliance.

Bavarian cabinet meeting in seclusion
</H1>
Today, the new Bavarian cabinet will complete a two-day meeting held in
seclusion at the cloister Seon in the Chiemgau region.  Under the
chairmanship of Minister President Stoiber, a roadmap for the next five
years of government is to be laid down.  The central points on today's
agenda are European and educational policy.  An important resolution
emerged yesterday that the state government will work towards a balanced
budget.  This goal is to be achieved over the next eight to nine years
through a committed course of austerity measures.  As a first step, the
state government gave itself a hefty pay cut.  The members of the Bavarian
Government are to have their compensation cut in half, and the retirement
age will be increased from 55 to 60 for all persons who serve less than
eight years in office.  All income from non-government related activity is
to be applied against the special one-time "transition payments" given to
departing members of the government.

<P>
Such severe cuts for cabinet members are unprecedented in Germany.
Further goals for the next five years are the continuation of the Bavarian
Employment Pact, openness to new technologies, and reform of the education
system, including more offers of afternoon classes and supervision outside
of regular school hours.  [Note: School days in Germany typically end at
1pm.]  Mr. Stoiber called the plans of the red-green coalition in Bonn to
increase the tax on crude oil a threat to thousands of jobs.  He said a
national tax on energy would be "disastrous."

Transrapid criticized
</H1>
One day before the coalition talks between SPD and the Greens address
transportation policy, independent critics have advised against
constructing the Transrapid, the controversial magnetic levitation train.
The German Institute for Economics Research considers the Transrapid
superfluous because existing high-speed trains already reach speeds of
300km/h.  The train travelers' association "Pro-Bahn" believes the
Transrapid is an overly expensive technology and would be difficult to
sell abroad.
