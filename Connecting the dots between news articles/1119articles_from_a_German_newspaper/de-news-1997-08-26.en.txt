Telephone dispute: PTT minister Boetsch to mediate
</H1>
In the dispute concerning the liberalisation of the telephone
communications market, the new private competitors of Deutsche
Telekom have asked Mr Boetsch, the minister for postal and
communications services, to mediate. The minister said he will think
about their demand.

<P>
In the opinion of the competitors of Deutsche Telekom the punctual
start of full competition in this sector is in danger - on January 1
the telephone monopoly of Deutsche Telekom will be abolished. But
after negotiations with the former state company and its new competitors
technical questions as well as the prices for using Telekom's net
are still unresolved.

Dispute on cabinet rebuilding continues within coalition
</H1>
Even after yesterday's "No." of Chancellor Helmut Kohl concerning
a possible cabinet rebuilding the debate on the subject continues.
Spokespersons of the CSU party said they still want a cabinet reform
before the elections to the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) next
year. CSU secretary-general Mr Protzner stressed that it was his party
who had started this debate. It was necessary that the coalition
government advances on solving these questions. The head of Lower-Saxony's
CDU, Mr Wulff, said the discussion could not be finnished just by Mr Kohl
putting his foot down. It would be better to lead a difficult debate now
than to regret later not to have tackled a difficult problem. The FDP
criticised again the discussion between the two parties, the CDU and
the CSU. It is said that Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel will discuse the matter
tomorrow. This, however, has not been confirmed officially. Meanwhile
Mr Kohl has underlined again his point of view, rejecting a possible
restructering: "I have no intention whatsoever to comment anymore on
this discussion". As Chancellor he had to make certain decisions.
He had done this and he did not feel obliged to comment on them the
next day.

<P>
In the meantime the daily newspaper "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" claims to
have found out that Chancellor Kohl had well intented a cabinet
rebuilding. The CSU parliamentary party leader in the Bavarian State
parliament, Mr Glueck, was almost certain to succeed Mr Borchert as
Minister of agriculture. This unexpected coup of the Chancellor had
been made impossible by Mr Waigel's comments and interviews Mr Kohl had
not been informed about before, according to the paper. Mr Kohl did not want
to get under pressure so he canceled his plans. In tomorrow's edition the
paper will report that leading CSU politicians accuse Mr Waigel of having
done dammage to the CSU. CSU spokespersons, however, said on Bayerischer
Rundfunk station the report has been invented by the paper.

Economists warn against fee and tax rises
</H1>
Given the fact of rising inflation economy experts have been warning
against increasing fees and a rise in the value added tax and the tax on
mineral oil products. The President of the Kiel Institut for the Economy of
the
World, Prof Sievert, is afraid of further stability risks that might trigger
the German Central Bank (Bundesbank) to increase interest rates. The Council
of German Chambers of Commerce hopes for an inflation rate of less than two
per cent and called on the Federal government to go easy on fees and on
payments to the social security system.

<P>
In August, the Federal Department of Statistics reported an inflation rate of
two per cent, mostly due to higher prices for mineral oil products and to an
increased fee for prescriptions.

Krenz to lodge an appeal
</H1>
Former East-German head of government and head of the communist party
Egon Krenz has appealed yesterday's decision of the Berlin Regional Court.
His attorney has justified the appeal with his limited possibilities to
defend Mr Krenz in court. The Berlin Regional Court had sentenced Mr Krenz
yesterday to 6 1/2 years in prison for his joint responsability for the
lethal shots at East-Germans trying to break through the border lines to the
West.

Beckstein demands tougher measures against organised crime
</H1>
The Bavarian Minister of the Interior, Mr Beckstein, has called
for a crack down on organised crime. The fight against international crime
was a vital question for democracy, said Mr Beckstein. Therefore it should
be possible to survey appartments with short-circuit television if tapping
telephone lines was not sufficient. In future the German Domestic
Intelligence Agency should investigate crimes all over Germany. It was also
necessary to act tougher on money laundering. It should be made obligatory
to declarelLarger amounts of cash when crossing borders.

<P>
The Liberal Democrats, however, warn against tougher laws. Two before the
start of the negociations on the bill "Grosser Lauschangriff" (big bugging
operation) [which would increase police's bugging opportunities], it was not
the right time to ask for new bills before others have been passed.

Complaint of unconstitutionality of spelling reform filed
</H1>
The spelling reform will now be decided upon by the Federal
Constitutional Court. A married couple from Luebeck has filed a complaint
of unconstitutionality of the spelling reform. The parents argue that the
spelling reform not only violates their personal freedom but also their
right to educate their children. Moreover, the spelling reform was so
important
that it could not be introduced without the legal backing of a bill. A similar
complaint of the plaintiffs had been rejected by the Schleswig Higher Regional
Court.
