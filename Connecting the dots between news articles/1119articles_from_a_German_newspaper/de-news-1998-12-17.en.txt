service

225
against the approval.  News has piled up in the past months of fraud and the
disappearance of millions inside of the EU administration.  The refusal is

BGH: Polygraphs inadmissible in criminal proceedings
</H1>
The Federal High Court (BGH) has declared the use of lie detectors as
inadmissible in criminal proceedings.  In their decision the judges
characterized
the instrument as too unreliable.  The question is whether the accused can
move for exoneration with the help of credible evidence from a polygraph.
The BGH had previously banned it in 1954. Numerous decisions by the courts
in the USA have also restricted the use of polygraphs.  In a hearing before
the
BGH on December 9, experts considered the test extremely inconclusive.
