Shortly only grain changed through gene technology left?
</H1>
In five years time no German bakery is going to have any
bread left, that is not made without ingredients changed through
gene technology. The central association of the baker's trade called
the attention heron. In the medium term bakeries receive only flour
produced out of grain changed through gene technology.
In the year 1997 the German bakeries increased their turnover by
1.5 %. According to the central association, the increase is mainly
a result of the successful sale of buns on Sundays. The association
also criticised the lack of professional staff; in many places no one
can be found for the offered apprenticeships.

decreased until the year 2008 of 1% of the total fee income, that
means decrease down to 80 million DM. In the long run such structure
fonds are going to be essential. According to the ARD chairman and
intendant of the Central Broadcasting Corporation (MDR), Mr Reiter,
next week this proposal is going to be discussed with representatives
of the smaller stations and will then be presented to the prime
minister.

Council of Cities rejects city center toll
</H1>
The Council of Baden-Wuerttemberg's Cities rejects a proposal by the EU
commission to introduce a city center toll. According to the council's opinion, traffic
problems in city centers could not be solved by deterring car drivers.
It was rather necessary to offer useful incentives to motorists to use the
public transportation system. The Council of Cities would, for example, not oppose
an increase of the tax on mineral oil, if the extra money could be used for
subsidising the communities' public transportation systems.

<P>
The EU commission had proposed to member states in July to introduce road
tolls in cities.

Kirch to cooperate with Berlusconi
</H1>
Munich media tycoon Leo Kirch wants to make the controversial
Italian entrepreneur and politician Silvio Berlusconi a partner of his deeply
indebted media group, according to a report of  the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung"
newspaper. By this move, Kirch wanted to consolidate his media empire
and prepare it for a listing at the stock exchange. Saudian prince Al-Walid
who is one of the richest men of Earth and who has already business relations
to Mr Berlusconi, is also said to participate in the alliance. A partnership with
the Australian media tycoon Rupert Murdoch, however, becomes more and
more unlikely.
