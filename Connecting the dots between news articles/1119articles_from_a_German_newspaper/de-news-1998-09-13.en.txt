Elections in Bavaria
</H1>
The local elections in Bavaria started off slowly on a rainy Sunday.
According to the German Press Agency (dpa), the voter turnout was
still far lower in the late morning than in elections four years ago.
In Munich only around six percent of voters had gone to polls three hours
after polling booths had opened. However, things picked up in the
afternoon,
by when, according to the dpa, around 40 percent of voters had gone to the
polls in the six largest cities, including postal votes. Election
organisers reported that there had been an increase of around two
percent in the voter numbers in comparison to 1994. A spokesman for
election administration in Wuerzburg said that many voters had had to
queue. This was also the case in Munich. There has been a significant
increase in the number of voters using the postal vote option.

The state elections in Bavaria (with an electorate of around 8.8 million)
are to determine representation in the Maximilianeum in Munich (Bavarian
state parliament). The CSU's aim was to attain over 50%
of the vote, whereas the SPD were just hoping to increase their
representation of 30%. This is the first time that the state parliament
has been elected for a period of five years instead of four.

This election is considered to be a test run for the general elections in
just over two weeks. Pollster predicted that the CSU would retain their
absolute majority in the Bavarian state parliament, and that
support for the SPD would increase slightly. Voters also had to elect
local
government representatives in the seven Bavarian regions, including
mayors and city councillors.
