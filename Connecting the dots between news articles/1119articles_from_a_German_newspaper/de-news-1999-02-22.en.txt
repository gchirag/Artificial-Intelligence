Further rise of flood waters in Upper Rhine expected
</H1>
A threatening flood-of the century has been temporarily averted on the
Upper Rhine.  Officials began today with the flooding of the Rhine basin.
The depth gauges in the Middle Rhine are still under dangerous levels,
measuring 8.3 meters in Karlsruhe, and 7.7 meters in Mannheim.  According
to the prognosis by the Floodwater Center, this is the calm before the
storm.  The tidal wave in Basel was also announced to be underestimated.
Predictions for tomorrow morning estimate a peak flood level at 9 meters in
Karlsruhe-Maxau.  The introductory restraint measures are considered by
experts to be only modest.  An additional weak point in the control of the
flooding could be dams, which are being watched around the clock.  About
25,000 sandbags have been prepared in Karlsruhe's Rhine port as a
precautionary measure.
