CDU and FDP want to continue their coalition
</H1>
Despite the controversies over the budget and taxes, CDU and FDP plan to
continue their coalition, both sides declared after separate meetings of the
party boards. The CDU secretary Hintze, however, called on the FDP to give up
"maximum positions." Hintze emphasized that the coalition would remain stable
even beyond the 1998 election year. Reports that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had
threatened to step down and that CSU leader Theo Waigel had indirectly sought
contact with the SPD were denied. The CDU parliamentary group leadership meet
for additional talks in Berlin. CSU secretary general Protzner also expressed
his faith in the duration of the coalition. He admonished the Liberals not to
stonewall a compromise in the dispute over the solutions regarding the budget
deficit. In Dresden, Chancellor Kohl expressed optimism that the planned tax
reform could be passed this year. Speaking at a ceremony for the 125th
anniversary of Dresdner Bank, Kohl called the reform a key project for an
increase in investments and jobs. SPD leader Lafontaine rejected the possibility
of a grand coalition with the CDU as a consequence of the budget dispute. If the
current government were at wits' end, new elections would be necessary, he said
after a meeting of the party board. The SPD demanded immediate programs for more
jobs and economic growth.
