Thyssen: Danger of unfriendly takeover by Krupp not over
</H1>
In spite of the talks between Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch showing positive
signs, Thyssen's central works council still does not think that the
danger is over. Mr Bongen, the chairman of the works council, said in
Duesseldorf that the plans for the takeover of Thyssen by Krupp cannot be
considered as having been totally concluded. The employee representatives
assume that plans to take over the whole Thyssen concern were still being
considered. This is the reason why the protests against the role of the
large banks in the planned takeover will still go ahead in Frankfurt am
Main on Tuesday.

Soldiers participating in attack on foreigners have been dismissed
</H1>
The nine soldiers who participated in attacks on foreigners in
Detmold will all be dismissed from military service. This was confirmed
by Harmut Bagger, the Inspector General of the German Federal Armed
Forces (Bundeswehr). He said that army conscripts who were in general
decent and willing workers should not have to be required to work with
such offenders. Mr Bagger also rejected accusations that political
education in the Bundeswehr was deficient. He said that it was a fact
that enmity against foreigners or rightist activism was seldom found in
soldiers who had been in the Bundeswehr for a longer period of time. Such
attitudes were almost exclusively found in the younger conscripts in the
first few weeks of their army service. According to Mr Bagger, this
showed that the army's programme of political and civil education was
effective.
