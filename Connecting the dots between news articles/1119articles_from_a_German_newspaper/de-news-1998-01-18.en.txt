Fischer points out consequences for national politics
</H1>
After the decision of the North Rhine-Westphalian Greens to continue
the coalition with the Social Democratic Party (SPD), the Parliamentary
Party Leader of the Greens has pointed out the consequences on the federal
level. Mr Fischer warned the SPD on the "ARD" TV station that the national
election at the end of September will be a decision about a new energy
policy. He said that the Greens could not support using brown coal as fuel
for electricity. North Rhine-Westphalia's State Premier Rau stressed that
the SPD will continue to support the mining of brown coal. In spite of
disagreement in this matter, the North Rhine-Westphalian Green Party
decided yesterday during a special party convention to continue the
coalition with the SPD.

Schaeuble against grand coalition on federal level
</H1>
The Parliamentary Leader of the Union Parties in the Bundestag, Mr.
Schaeuble, has revised earlier statements and now opposes a grand coalition
(CDU/CSU and SPD). On the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station, Mr. Schaeuble
rejected even a short-term collaboration to solve pressing national
problems. He said that the present governing coalition has to instead fight
for victory in the coming state parliament elections to break the SPD's
majority in the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament] before the Bundestag
[lower house of parliament] elections in September. A week ago, Mr.
Schaeuble had not excluded a grand coalition in an interview with the
magazine "Spiegel". He said that in the September election, the Union's
goal is to attract more than 40 percent of the votes.  Union parties have
to fight for themselves to reach that goal and that they Union cannot give
away any votes.

PDS plans to support Lafontaine
</H1>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) has announced their support of
Oskar Lafontaine, the head of the SPD, to avoid a grand coalition after the
Bundestag election. Gregor Gysi, the Speaker of the PDS fraction, said, if
Mr. Lafontaine needs his party's support and prefers a minority government
to a grand coalition, the PDS would cooperate. But Mr. Gysi however rejects
supporting the State Premier of Lower Saxony Gerhard Schroeder in the
election for Chancellor. He said that the PDS only supports a reform
government, which, in his opinion, is impossible with Mr. Schroeder.

and State Premier Gerhard Schroeder participated in the opening ceremony.

the Bundestag, was expected in Hannover as well. The result of the election
on March 1 is viewed as a decision about who is going to be the SPD's

for Chancellor if he receives 2 percent fewer votes in Lower Saxony than in

Warning against tightening non-smoker protection laws
</H1>
Mr. Scholz, the legal expert of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU),
has warned against tightening non-smoker protection laws. He referred to
plans to punish violations of non-smoker protection laws with 5000 mark
fines. Mr. Scholz told the weekly paper "Bild am Sonntag" that the goal
should be an efficient government with less bureaucracy and laws. Militant
non-smokers' plans have exactly the opposite effect. Mr. Lutz, the
President of the Police Union, agrees with this and said that the police
have more important things to do than to deal with illegal smokers.
