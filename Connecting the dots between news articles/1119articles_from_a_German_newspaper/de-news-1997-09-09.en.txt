Start of budget debate 1998
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel presented the 1998 budget
bill to the Bundestag today. It has a total
value of 461 billion marks.

<P>
The four-day-long debate was opened by members of the parties of the
coalition government, describing the recent economic development as
positive. They also stressed the dynamic growth of the export sector
that is now starting to stipulate domestic consumption.

<P>
Representatives of the opposition parties called the financial policy
of the government incomprehensible, running up a dramatic budget
deficit. In view of that record deficit, Mr Waigel's policy has failed
in the opinion of the Social Democrats and the Greens. SPD's financial
expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier said more and more holes in the budget and
a rising deficit are putting the state into a difficult financial
position.

<P>
On the other hand, Finance Minister Mr Waigel called his budget
policy balanced and promised that the deficit would decrease again
to around DM58bio in the next few years.

<P>
A large part was dedicated to the proposed tax reform. In that
matter the Bundestag called again on the Mediation Committee of the
two houses of parliament.

New record high of unemployment rate
</H1>
The number of unemployed people in Germany rose to the new
record high of 4.37 million in August, the highest number ever in
an August since World War II. Compared to 12 months ago, the unemployment
rate has increased from 10.2% to 11.4%. Compared to July, the nationwide
rate as well as the rate in the West remained unchanged at 11.4% and
9.7%, respectively, while it rose from 18.1% to 18.3% in the East.

<P>
President of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said that in the
West the peak has been reached. In the East, however, he expects a
further increase in the unemployment rate. While the East still
suffers from the low domestic consumption and the breakdown in the
construction sector, the West almost exclusively profits from the
strong rise in exports.

<P>
The German export industry expects an excellent result for this
year. The President of the Federation of wholesale and foreign traders,
Mr Fuchs, said in a newspaper interview that German exports are projected
to rise 8.5% in 1997.

Employers with apprentices to be preferred for public contracts
</H1>
As a reaction to the low number of apprenticeship positions offered
by companies the Federal government will give preference when attributing
public contracts to companies that train apprentices. The cabinet called
on the Laender, the Federal states, to follow their initiative.

<P>
At the end of August some 152,000 were still looking for an
apprenticeship. At the same time only 58,000 free positions were
available.

West-Germans have to accept cuts in unemployment benefits
</H1>
According to a decision of the Federal Social Court, unemployed
persons in West-Germany have to accept cuts in their unemployment
benefits when this is done to provide funding for unemployment benefits
for unemployed persons in East-Germany. The cuts would not violate
constitutionally secured rights of ownership. The Court rejected the
case of a West-German who did not want to accept a cut in his unemployment
benefit.

Inflation rate at 2.1% in August
</H1>
Prices continue to rise faster and faster in Germany.
According to the Federal Department of Statistics, the annual inflation
rate was at 2.1% in August, the highest value since January 1995 when
it was at 2.2%. Compared to last month the annual rate rose by 0.1
percentage points. Above all, higher prescription fees and a rise in
petrol prices have driven up inflation.
