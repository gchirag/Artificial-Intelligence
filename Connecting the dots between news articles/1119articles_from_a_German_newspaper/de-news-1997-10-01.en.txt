Coalition debates financing the solidarity surcharge reduction
</H1>
The heads of the coalition in Bonn met today, at the Chancellor's
office surprisingly, to renew their work on how the planned reduction
in the solidarity surcharge [an extra 7.5% on income tax] can be
financed. Apparently, the FDP wants to present its proposal for
financing to counter the reduction in the surcharge.  The FDP's
proposal concentrates on further savings and privatization. The
Deutsche Presseagentur (German Press Agency) has reported that the
proposed introduction of an insurance tax on risk insurance has been
rejected, however.  If the solidarity surcharge is reduced from 7.5%
to 5.5%, the state treasury would lose an additional DM 7 billion
revenue. The FDP have already had to withdraw an announced surcharge
reduction once, as the budget deficit could not be corrected.  On
account of this, the liberals want to stand firm and not be derailed,
this time.

Metal industry employers accept agreement on "part-time pension"
</H1>
According to the IG Metall [Union for Metal, Engineering and
Electronics], the industry employers today adopted a mediated
settlement regarding the "part-time pension" in North
Wuerttemberg/North Baden.  None of the directors or the committee were
in opposition to the settlement, reported the responsible union
chapter in Stuttgart.  The compromise on wages provides for an
arrangement to be made in the coming month, regarding the "part-time
pension", for those employees of the firms who are over 55 years of
age.  After the age of 61, the "part-time pension" becomes a right.
This is a precedent setting resolution for the industry in the whole
of Germany.

Schulte against high wage demands in the next round of negotiations
</H1>
DGB President Schulte does not think that the unions should force a
greatly increased wage in the coming negotiations.  Schulte made his
comments, which go against what the IG-Metall President Zwickel has
said, to the Koelner Stadtanzeiger newspaper. Zwickel had recommended
strong wage demands, because the failure of tax reform has meant that
there will be no tax reductions for wage earners.  In contrast,
Schulte's opinion is that wage politics should primarily assure the
security of employment.  As an example of this, Schulte referred to
the adjustment of early retirement/part-time work in the Southwest
German metal industry.

Controversy over low-wage jobs
</H1>
A controversy has arisen in the Bundestag over the controversial
freedom from social security for low paid jobs.  In the topical debate
moved for by the Social Democrats, SDP representative Ulla Schmidt
stressed that the number of so-called "610 DM jobs" is increasing in
parallel with the growth of unemployment.  Jobs requiring social
security payments  are increasingly being transformed into ones that
do not.  CSU representative Ramsauer attributed this to the general
high tax-load, a reduction in which the Opposition has hindered.  FDP
politician Babel rejected an abolishment of this type of employment as
unsocial.

Yilmaz accepts EU membership without work or residence freedom
</H1>
Turkish Prime Minister Yilmaz is ready to compromise to obtain an EU
membership for his country.  After his return from a 2 day visit to
Bonn, he spoke before the parliamentary deputies from his party in
Ankara, saying he had reached an understanding with Chancellor Kohl.
Kohl explained his fear that up to 8 million Turks would come to
Germany to seek work as a result of Turkey joining the EU. Yilmaz
emphasized that he is therefore ready for Turkey to give up the right
of free choice of work and place of residence as a condition of
joining the EU.

Germany to take part in development of new transport aircraft
</H1>
Defense minister Ruehe confirmed that the NATO countries, together
with Russia are planning to develop a new transport aircraft.  The
aircraft will be based on the Antonov military transport, and will
take the place of the antiquated Transall aircraft.  In addition to
Germany and Russia, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy are
interested in the project.  It appears the key role will be played by
the European Airbus company.  In Germany, around 80 Transall aircraft
must be replaced by the armed forces in the next 10 years.  The
Russian Antonov is deployed world wide as a transport aircraft, and is
valued by pilots for its robustness.

Public health insurance in the East needs help from the West
</H1>
Health Minister Seehofer stressed that the East German public health
insurance funds will need assistance from the West to equalize their
deficits.  Savings alone will not make up the difference, Seehofer
said, after a meeting with his colleagues from the new federal States
as well as with representatives of the funds in Bonn.  A joint
workgroup is expected to present a proposed solution by the end of the
month.

Kohl calls for better dissemination of research results
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl asked for a faster better dissemination of research
results.  To accomplish this, the potential users of the results
should be more closely included in the development process than in the
past, said Kohl at a public seminar (part of the "Research Days" at
Schiller University in Jena).  The chances for commercial utility
should be realized more consistently.
