DM 4 billion deficit for public insurance plans
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Seehofer and the public health insurance
companies foresee the possibility of not increasing premiums in Western
Germany until the end of next year. Presenting the semi-annual financial
report for the public insurance companies, Seehofer said that, despite a
deficit of about DM 4 billion in the first half of 1997, rate increases
could be done without, in the middle term. He added, however, that that
was assuming the companies continued to cut back expenses. Expenditures
for services are down about 1 percent so far this year, while monies
coming in have remained constant.
Due to the difficult financial situation in Eastern Germany, premium
increases could not be ruled out. Several of the large public insurance
companies have announced that they would leave the premiums there
untouched on the condition that no "solidarity funds" were used to
compensate for the deficit in the East.

President Herzog ends official visit in Moscow
</H1>
Moscow, Russia. Federal President Herzog has ended the official part of
his state visit in Russia. Speaking before the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the Russian Duma, Herzog called on Russians and Germans to quickly
expand upon the cooperation already in evidence between the two peoples.
Herzog called on the Russian deputies to seek out partnership with the
West, and to avoid old-style power politics. He promised Germany's
continuing support for democratic reforms in Russia, for the sake of a
common future in peace. Herzog thanked Russian President Yeltsin for his
hospitality, saying he was met with an "unbelievably heartfelt
atmosphere". Following Herzog's appearance, a communist deputy presented
him with a resolution, in the name of the majority of Duma members, in
support of former East German leader Egon Krenz, who was sentenced to six
and a half years' imprisonment last week in Berlin.
To finish his visit, Herzog has flown to Samara on the Volga River to take
part in celebrations as Sara and Stuttgart are officially named sister
cities.

fight youth unemployment, at a closed meeting. An Apprenticeship-Financing
Law is intended to relieve the financial burden of companies offering
apprenticeship positions to a sufficient number of young people. Companies

programme. At the same time, the SPD members supported a move to introduce
qualification measures for beginning careers.

Rexrodt: Programme for investment and jobs successful
</H1>
More than a year and a half after presenting a 50-point programme to
encourage investment and jobs, Federal Economic Minister Rexrodt has
judged it a success. In an interim report which Rexrodt presented to the
cabinet today, he indicated that almost all of the planned measures had
been realized or at least initiated. The economic upswing is gaining
momentum, German companies are more competitive and the long-awaited
turn-around in the labour markets is getting closer, according to Rexrodt.
The Economic Ministry is projecting 4.2 million unemployed for 1998,
however; that is about 100,000 fewer than at present.

nearly all refugees from Algeria, despite on-going terrorist activity by
Islamic fundamentalists there.
