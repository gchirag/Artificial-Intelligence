Riester: no employment obligations expected
</H1>
Designated Employment Minister Walter Riester does not expect any
obligations from the concern of the much strived-after "Alliance for
Work" for a specific number of new job openings. Such a commitment
could not be kept, Mr Riester explained on ZDF TV station, because
the employers' association would have no mandate for it. Individual
enterprises direct themselves in their employment practices according
to the requirements, not just the recommendations of their association
representatives. President of the employers' association "Gesamtmetall"
Werner Stumpfe welcomed Mr Riester's announcement.

Hildebrandt calls for new education tax
</H1>
Brandenburg's Employment Minister Regine Hildebrandt strengthened
her demand for a training position tax.  The federal government has
to take up a bill already drafted by the SPD faction of the Bundestag
(lower house of parliament), Ms Hildebrandt said in an interview for
the ADN news agency. The tax however would have to consider the economic
realities of employers and of different regions.  In addition,
Ms Hildebrandt backed the proposal for a job guarantee for apprentices by
their employers for at least a year after completion of training.  The
necessary funding for this measure would have to come from the Federal
government however.
