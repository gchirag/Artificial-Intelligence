Colonia Dignidad. They are looking for the leader of the sect, Paul

property in southern Chile during the military dictatorship of General
Pinochet.

New "Alliance for Employment" to be launched
</H1>
Government, economy, and unions have agreed to launch a new initiative for
more jobs in East Germany. Government spokesman Peter Hausmann announced in
Bonn the project will be presented on Thursday at a press conference. The
new Alliance for Employment is to at least stop the reduction of jobs in
the new states and create 100,000 new jobs annually starting 1998. Unions
and employers agreed to reduce the disadvantage of the eastern economy
regarding wage costs per unit and to open regional collective agreements to
allow leeway for company adjustments. Employers promise to buy more
products and strengthen their subsidiaries in the East. The government will
contribute the continuation of an economic support scheme to be passed by
the cabinet tomorrow.

Justice spokesman demands clear rules for organ donation
</H1>
Minister of Justice Mr Schmidt-Jortzig has demanded clear rules for organ
donation in Germany. The decision for or against organ donation was a
citizen's duty, the FDP politician said. Each person ought to carry a donor
card stating whether or not he or she agrees to donate organs after death.
The justice ministry stated this could be handled by filling in a form at
the local citizen's registration offices.

Quarrel about pension level continues
</H1>
The latest statements by union leader Dieter Schulte about a reduction of
the pension level has caused an argument among Social-Democrats and unions.
While the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister for Social Affairs, Mr. Gerster,
SPD, supports Mr. Schulte, SPD faction leader Rudolf Scharping stated his
party would maintain the current pension level. Schleswig-Holstein's State
Premier Heide Simonis suggested on ZDF television to support the pension
plan in some form by taxes. The SPD politician added this represents
partial support for the suggestions of Saxony's State Premier Kurt
Biedenkopf, CDU. The DGB chief was also backed by the Union for
Transportation and Government Employees, OeTV. Schulte's statement was also
welcomed by CDU secretary-general Peter Hintze and employers association
president Dieter Hundt. Last weekend, Schulte had backed off from insisting
on maintaining the current pension level.

Discussion about modernizing the regional collective agreement system
</H1>
The demand by head of the National Federation of Unions (DGB) Dieter
Schulte to fundamentally modernize the regional collective agreement system
has been mostly met with approval. SPD faction leader Rudolf Scharping said
on Deutschlandradio Berlin radio that his party, too, is for more
flexibility. Employers, too, welcomed the DGB proposal. CEO of the National
Federation of Employer Associations Mr. Goener (sp?) said on Saarlandischer
Rundfunk radio the regional collective agreement system would die if the
companies were not given more leeway. Unions, however, were split about
Schulte's move. While his demand was supported by the Chemical Industry
Union, IG Chemie, the media union called the proposal a "wrong signal of
concession to the employers".

Number of conscientious objectors declines
</H1>
The number of conscientious objectors has declined. The Government
Commissioner for Conscientious Objectors Mr. Hackler believes that more and
more youths accept military service. Since the beginning of the 1990s the
number of applications to renounce military service have been stable at a
high level. In 1996 there was a small decline that continued this year.
Hackler called this a reversal of trends.

Police union wants to reduce age for criminal discretion
</H1>
The Police Union within the Government Employee Alliance (Beamtenbund)
recommends that children as young as twelve should be punishable. The
union's deputy president Mr. Lenders (sp?) argued today on NDR radio that
criminal offences are more and more often committed by children as young as
12 or 13 years old. The recommendation's intent, however, was not to put
youngsters into jail but to make clear to them that they could not simply
return to daily business after a criminal offence. A prison sentence for
this age group, however, should only be given under rare circumstances.

Water quality of German coastal and inland waters mediocre
</H1>
The European Commission has rated the quality at German beaches at coasts
and lakes as mediocre. The latest beach report shows that 82 percent of
coastal beaches and almost 61 percent of lake beaches meet the
unconditional requirements for water purity. This is too low according to
the Commission. Highest ratings received the East Frisian Islands and the
east coast of Ruegen and Usedom. The water quality of Sylt, however, has
declined.
