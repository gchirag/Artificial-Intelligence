Search continues for victims and plane parts after crash
</H1>
Three days after the crash of a German and a US-American military plane the
first parts of the US plane were found before the coast of Namibia. A
spokesman of the German Defence Ministry stated in Bonn all evidence
indicated that both planes had crashed at the same time. So far, only one
victim of the accident has been found. Fishers retrieved a female body from
the sea. The Defence Ministry said the woman was on the German Tupolev.
There were 24 people on board of the German plane and 9 on the US plane. A
rescue officer was sceptical that any victims would still be found alive.
German Defence Minister Volker Ruehe rejected accusations today that the
first alarms about the disappearance of the German plane have been answered
late by the air rescue team because of a celebration. The Namibian air
traffic control stated it had neither received a flight schedule for the
Tupolev nor a take-off signal. Defence Minister Ruehe said, apparently a
gap in the African air safety network had caused the delays.

Schaeuble: Euro can't be stopped
</H1>
According to leading CDU/CSU politicians the start of the Monetary Union on
1 January 1999 could no longer be stopped. A delay would affect the
[monetary] stability that has already been achieved. This is stated in a
position paper presented by CDU/CSU faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble. He
said it was more important to meet the Maastricht criteria over a long
range of time. This did not mean, however, that the deficit criterion of 3
percent was no longer effective. A discussion about 3.0 or 3.1 percent,
though, was too short-sighted, Schaeuble stressed. The position paper is
targeted against criticism by CDU/CSU state premiers Edmund Stoiber and
Kurt Biedenkopf who do not want to rule out a delay of the Monetary Union.

Civil servant union demands 3.5 percent higher salaries
</H1>
The national union of civil servants (Deutscher Beamtenbund) is aiming for
3.5 percent higher salaries for civil servants and public employees in the
collective bargaining for 1998, said union president Mr. Geyer in Bonn.
East German employees should receive 90% of the salaries in the West. The
demands also include part-time retirement and work-time accounts. The civil
servant union wants to renounce parts of the salary to reduce the heavy
strain on public budgets caused by [government-funded] pensions for civil
servants.

Beef imports not sufficiently controlled
</H1>
Some federal states take the check of the import ban on British beef too
easy, said Health Minister Horst Seehofer. Seehofer stated today in
Duesseldorf that the EU Commission had found considerable shortcomings in
the veterinary controls in five states, among them North-Rhine Westphalia,
Schleswig-Holstein, and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In two states the flaws were so
large that the veterinary authorities had to take immediate action
according to Seehofer. Seehofer did not want to mention the names of those
states. Seehofer said the controllers had criticized especially that German
authorities checked the import documents but not the beef delivery itself.

Union considers new SPD economy platform a "change of policy"
</H1>
The German Union of Employees (DAG) considers the Social-Democrats' new
economic platform a change of policy. DAG chief Mr. Issen said the SPD
platform showed a change of direction regarding the financing by taxes of
unrelated services covered by [social] insurances and regarding the
accumulation of assets. There was a visible policy change, for example, to
subsidize employment rather than unemployment. Issen also mentioned the
SPD's intent to alleviate collective agreement politics by encouraging
employee participation in the productive capital.

Arguments continue between Bavaria and Brussels about agro-politics
</H1>
Differences in opinion persist in the argument between Bavaria and the
European Union about the European agriculture policy. State Premier Edmund
Stoiber said there was progress but the differences have also become
evident. Stoiber criticized in particular planned price reductions for
beef, grain, and milk. EU Commissioner Franz Fischler defended the aims of
the planned agricultural reform contained in the so-called Agenda 2000. The
reform would secure the competitiveness of European agriculture on the
world market in the long-term. Bavarian farmers should use this chance.

Disagreement within OeTV about work time reduction
</H1>
Three weeks before negotiations for the 1998 collective agreement for the
services sector start, disagreements surface within the public services and

along with proportionally reduced pay if the employers guarantee the
existing jobs in exchange. The collective bargaining for the 3.2 million
public service workers and employees start October 7.
