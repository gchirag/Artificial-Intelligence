Different reactions to autumn economy forecast
</H1>
This autumn's economy forecast of the leading economy research
institutes have caused controversial reactions. The think-tanks predict
a growth of 1.5% for this year, and 2.5% for 1997. Next year's budget deficit
is estimated by them at 3.5% of GDP. The government takes the report as
proof for an economic recovery, while employers and unions warn of too
much optimism.

<P>
The forecast confirms previous government predictions of a 2 to 2.5 per cent
growth. However, according to the forecast the criteria for the European
monetary union will not be met - the Maastricht treaty calls for budget
deficit not higher than 3%. Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel nonetheless
still assumes that it will be possible to reduce the budget deficit 1997
to below 3%.

<P>
Employers and unions agree on the forecast is too optimistic. The national
employers' confederation said the prognosis stated, one should not be
deceived by the 2.5% growth forecast in that the recovery is still fragile.
Lower contributions to social security and therefore welfare cuts are
absolutely necessary. The unions repeat to demand actions to fight
unemployment that will not decrease despite the economic growth, according
to the forecast.

Investigations stopped in AIDS scandal
</H1>
Government officials and politicians will not be held criminally
accountable for the AIDS scandal of the eighties. Thirteen years after
the scandal was uncovered, investigations against executive officials of
the Health Ministry and the former Department of Health have been suspended.

<P>
The Public Prosecutor investigated against the former Ministry for Health,
Youth, and Families but did not find evidence of negligence. Therefore,
neither politicians nor government officials will be made accountable for
the death of haemophiliacs in Germany.

<P>
The ministry was charged with causing the death of patients in the eighties
by negligence because it did not properly supervise the Federal Health
Department's duties. After two years of investigations the proceedings were
stopped. A Bundestag inquirement committee found that in 60% of the cases the
infection of the haemophiliacs would have been avoidable if the Health
Department had acted decisively after first cases showed up in 1993. Out of
2,400 registered haemophiliacs, 1,100 were infected with the AIDS virus by
blood conserves and drugs. Until now, 470 haemophiliacs have died of AIDS
according to government statistics, or 550 according to scientific statistics.

Kohl to continue Asia tour
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will not cancel the rest of his Asia tour
because of a special session of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament)
tomorrow. The SPD had asked him to comment on the current budget situation.

<P>
The second stop on his Asia tour are the Philippines. Again as
in Indonesia, the key issue is not human rights questions but the signing
of economic contracts. The Chancellor's one-week Asia tour will end with
a visit to Japan.

<P>
His visit to Indonesia was not a perfect success. He was able to mention
human rights questions but, as expected, did not get any promises for an
improvement.
<P>
The main purpose of his 8-day Asia trip - an intensification of the
trade with and a higher presence of German industry in South-East Asia -
was served more successfully though; contracts totaling
Dm1.05bn were signed and a large German business park was initiated,
a business park that will be the first of its kind in Asia.

<P>
In Manila business representatives signed three extensive trade contracts.
They have a total value of Dm1.5bn. Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the
Philippine President Fidel Ramos asked the German industry for more
investments. The biggest of the three projects is a gas- and steam-turbine
based power station south of Manila that will be built and operated by Siemens.

No toxic waste in Beirut
</H1>
The waste that was shipped from Germany to Lebanon is not toxic
according to Greenpeace. The contents of the containers is unsorted
plastic waste and chemicals that should be classified special waste.
Duesseldorf public prosecutor's office considers an on-site investigation.
Therefore it is necessary to determine whether the waste in question is
toxic or special waste. The waste now discovered in Lebanon
had been stored on the premises of a company in Philipsburg for years.
A firm in Hagen seems to have handled the transport
to Lebanon. The executive manager of this firm has been on remand since
end of August. Meanwhile a spokesperson of the Ministry of Justice
announced more severe punishment for illegal waste deals.

Police clears makeshift village of environmentalists
</H1>
Police cleared a makeshift village that environmentalists had built
in a park. They protested against the felling of some 100 oak trees in
the way of the new B31 federal highway.
Some 200 demonstrators were sitting on the ground, some 40 others in their
tree houses. The most difficult task of the police officers was to get the
forty persons out of the 20m-30m high tree tops. To this purpose
special units with climbing gear came in from Bavaria.
With few exceptions the clearing of the squatters was peaceful although
police did not operate very gently.

OeTV union and SPD against cuts in public sector
</H1>
Unions and the Social-Democrats firmly reject sick pay cuts for workers and
employees in the public sector as demanded earlier by Bavarian politicians.

<P>
Head of union for public service and transportation (OeTV) Herbert May
threatened with strike if sick pay cuts are applied. In the Cologne
newspaper EXPRESS Mr May advised the public employers not to
terminate the current bargaining agreements.

<P>
State Premier Kurt Beck (SPD) of Rhineland-Palatinate called the Bavarian
demarche not very wise. The termination of the bargaining agreements would
be a wrong signal.

Foreign investments are only little threat to existing job
</H1>
Foreign investments of German companies destroy inland jobs on a low scale
only according to a study of Munich Ifo institute for economic research.
Only seven to sixteen per cent of all companies link foreign investments
to job cuts in Germany. The low attractivity of Germany as base of economic
activity is shown by the fact that almost no investments of foreign companies
where made in Germany in previous years.
