Greens quarrel about minister for the Environment Trittin
</H1>
The conflict within the Greens for the programmed renewal of the
party, has sharpened to an intense dispute around minister for the
Environment Juergen Trittin. The Greens' spokesperson for budgetary policy,
Mr Metzger, described Mr Trittin as a major burden for the government and
party, and once again demanded his resignation. According to Mr Metzger,
Mr Trittin's resignation would be a coup for the Greens and would
immediately win them a one or two percentage point increase in the
election polls.
Mr Trittin himself refused to comment on the statements made by the, in his
words, 'backbenchers'. Faction leader Ms Mueller rejected Mr Metzgers
criticism as an unbelievable scenario. Party leader Ms Radke turned down
the demand for resignation. The parliamentary faction of the Buendnis
90/Greens also backed the minister for Environment. No formal agreement
was reached in today's meeting, however.
Many Greens criticise Mr Trittin's role in the EU­ruling on the
postponement of the decree on used vehicles. Mr Trittin acted against his
convictions and on the Chancellor's instructions in preventing an
obligation for the car industry to take back used up cars free of
charge.

Turkey, together with Foreign minister Joschka Fischer to inform himself
on the Turkish position regarding future proceedings in the Ocalan issue.

problems. Buendnis 90/Green and the FDP also sharply criticized the

VdK president calls for pensions debate
</H1>
The president of the social association VdK, Mr Hierlinger, has called
for a "pensions summit" before the parlamentiary summer break. Mr Hierlinger
said in a newspaper interview, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder could not escape
creating an "Alliance for social security". Former Labour Minister Norbert
Bluem said long-time unemployed people and pensionners in the New States
were the big loosers of the reform plans of the red-green government. By
coupling pension increases to inflation, pensioners in the East will never
catch up to the pensions level in the West, according to Mr Bluem.
