VW and General Motors agree to compromise
</H1>
US-car maker General Motors and Volkswagen have buried
the hatchet as far as the long-ranging dispute about Mr Lopez was concerned,
agreeing to a compromise. According to sources in Detroit, VW would
have agreed to pay GM 100 million dollars in damages, and purchase GM-parts
to the tune of 1 billion dollars over the next seven years. GM also insist
on an apology, and everyone is on tenter-hooks about its wording. GM, in
turn, will drop the civil case against Mr Lopez and VW.

<P>
Mr Lopez' resignation from VW, on 29 November 1996, had helped both sides to
reach a compromise. GM and Opel had accused Mr Lopez and several top
managers of industrial espionage, embezzlement of confidential company
documents, criminal conspiracy and destroying incriminating material, and
gone for a civil case in Detroit. VW would have had to pay billions of
marks, if convicted.

Federal Ministers refute claim they discriminate against Scientology
</H1>
Several federal ministers refuted claims, by prominent US-actors,
of discrimination against Scientology-members in Germany. Foreign Minister
Kinkel emphasised in the tabloid BILD, that whoever tried to draw parallels
between the way Scientology was treated and the treatment meted out to the
Jews during the Third Reich, was faking history, and insulting the victims
and their relatives. Federal Labour Minister Bluem and Federal Family
Minister Nolte agreed.

Verdict in Graf-trial draws closer
</H1>
The sentence is expected for 24 January, according to the Mannheim
District Court. Next week the public prosecutor and defence counsel will be
pleading. A recent estimate by tax-authorities found that Mr Graf would
probably owe 16.3 million marks, that's 3 million marks less than originally
established. Graphological experts also determined that tennis-player Steffi
Graf had not signed her 1993 tax-return in person.

ALDI-extortionists sentenced
</H1>
Today the two ALDI-extortionists were sentenced to several years'
jail: 9 years for the 23-year old main offender, and 4 years for his
older brother, for having been an accessory. The sentences, handed down by
the Essen District Court, were for trying to get 3 million marks from
supermarket chain ALDI by putting explosives in juice-containers and a
quark-bowl. Last year the home-made mini-bombs had exploded in Leipzig,
Halle, Braunschweig and Bergen near Celle, though no-one had been hurt. The
court's fairly severe sentence also took into account the two savings banks
robberies the man pulling the wires had committed previously, netting about
32,000 marks in autumn 1994 and spring 1995. The 23-year old man from Halle
had been malicious, according to the court, and there was no way his offence
could be belittled, or put down to bungling, as the defence had claimed. The
main perpetrator did not say if he was ready to accept the sentence, but his
brother did.

Presumably arson at Waiblingen District Hospital
</H1>
The fire in the Waiblingen District Hospital apparently was
arson, and police are looking for the alleged perpetrator using identikit
pictures. The arson-attack caused about 2 million marks' worth of damage,
though no-one was hurt. When analysing the rubble, no traces of accelerants
were found, and there were no indications of technical defects either. Police
are looking for an approximately 35-year old man, about 180 centimetres
tall, very thin, with an oval face, short brown hair and a parting on the
right. He was wearing jeans and a brown wind-jacket, and might be a witness
or even the perpetrator.
