Krupp and Thyssen to found joint steel company
</H1>
The Krupp-Hoesch company and Thyssen Ltd. want to jointly
found a steel company and in this way get around Krupp's planned take-over
of Thyssen. The goal is evidently to work out a concept for cooperating in
the steel industry, within 8 days. During this period, Krupp will delay
its hostile takeover bid. This announcement was made today in Duesseldorf
by the government of North Rhine-Westphalia and the two companies.
Executives from both companies agreed to the plan yesterday evening at a
meeting with state Premier Rau. Chancellor Kohl had called on Krupp and
Thyssen to find a reasonable solution to their dispute, in the interests
of all Germans.
<P>
Protests by the employees at both companies continue. More than 10,000
workers at Thyssen gathered in Duisburg to discuss measures to be taken
against the takeover. According to the employees' factory committee,
workers at Krupp-Hoesch also laid down their work and stopped production.

CDU to stick to pensions financed by contributions
</H1>
The CDU wants to retain the pension system in which payments are
financed by contributions; the party also wants to make some corrections
to the system. Delegates at a mini party convention have come to this
decision, accepting the course suggested by Employment Minister Bluem with
a large majority. Bluem's concept basically takes into account increasing
life expectancies in future pension calculations, so that the payment rate
will gradually fall to 64 percent of a person's last net income.
<P>
Premier Biedenkopf of Saxony did not present his alternative model, of a
basic pension level financed by tax revenues, for official consideration.
His request that the party put off its decision for a few months did not
receive the support of a majority of delegates.

Resumption of tax talks between Coalition and SPD in danger
</H1>
The resumption of talks on tax reform between the Coalition and the
SPD is evidently in doubt. SPD leader Lafontaine sent a letter to
Chancellor Kohl, demanding that contributions to unemployment insurance
and the federal pension plan be lowered by 2 percent each as of July 1 of
this year. He said that in compensation, the value-added tax and the oil
tax should be increased, and the decrease in the Solidarity Supplement,
which is already on the books and due to go into force on January 1, 1998,
should be cancelled. In Chancellor Kohl's written response to the letter,
he declines a personal meeting with Lafontaine. Kohl did emphasize that
negotiations between the Coalition and the SPD should be resumed as
quickly as possible, but he only offered to set up a meeting between
Lafontaine and Finance Minister Waigel in the next few days. Kohl also
rejected Lafontaine's demand that the coalition make concrete suggestions
before the talks are resumed.
In an initial reaction to Kohl's letter, the SPD has said its members must
discuss whether there is any sense now in resuming the talks at all.
<P>
The SPD had broken off the talks because of the government's policies
regarding coal mining.

Recession continues in construction industry
</H1>
The German construction industry is an another year of recession,
according to the employers' association. The industry expects to have to
cut another 74,000 jobs. President of the association, Franz, complained
especially of a fall-off of construction investments in the East. He also
said that, besides the consequences of an economic downturn, German
construction companies also had to deal with increasing competition from
low-wage companies from abroad.
<P>
The Bundestag held a special sitting this afternoon to discuss the
situation of the construction industry. Spokesmen from the Government and
the Opposition condemned the illegal employment of foreigners for very low
wages on German construction sites. The SPD called for tougher penalties
for violators. The party also accused the Government of failing to deal
with the matter.

Philipp: Surplus in nursing care insurance should go to lower premiums
</H1>
Trades President Philipp and the FDP social expert Barbel (sp?) have
suggested that the surplus of billions of Marks in the nursing care
insurance system be used to finance a cut in premiums, from 1.7 percent to
1.5. Philipp said in a newspaper interview that the move would bring
companies some relief from too-high secondary wage costs. Presently, the
surplus in the nursing care insurance system is running at about 8 billion
Marks.

Trial over continued operation of nuclear power plant begins
</H1>
The Hesse Administrative Court has begun hearings on the continued
operation of the Biblis nuclear power plant. The court will rule on the
case of municipalities and private citizens against the reactor's
operation. They want it shut down because of inadequate fire protection
and a construction insufficient to withstand earthquakes and possible
airplane crashes. The company operating the plant, RWE, considers the
charges invalid. The formal opponent of the plaintiffs in this trial is
the State of Hesse, represented by the Ministry for the Environment, led
by the Green Party. In principle, both sides in the trial agree with one
another: Hesse has already tried 3 times to shut down one block of Biblis,
but the Federal Environment Ministry rejected the closure.

Terrific increase in public debts
</H1>
The debts held by federal, state, and local governments in
Germany have sky-rocketed in the last several years. According to the
Federal Bank, public debt more than doubled between 1989 and 1996. The
debt load now stands at over 2 trillion Marks. The Federal Bank says that
more than half of that amount is connected with reunification, but adds
that that reason cannot apply for an indefinite period.

Measures against illegal entry of Albanians
</H1>
The Italian government has proclaimed an emergency situation in
all of Italy, because of the continuing flow of refugees from Albania into
the country. The proclamation allows the government to have access to
additional funds and to prepare emergency shelter for the refugees more
quickly. Authorities can now also send back any of the refugees who
threaten the public order in Italy.
<P>
In Bonn, Federal Internal Affairs Minister Kanther instructed German
border guards to institute tighter security at German borders, given the
situation in Albania. Bavarian Internal Affairs Minister Beckstein has
also already ordered tighter controls at the state's borders. The state
government has indicated that there are approximately 1,500 officials in
place to prevent illegal entry.
Beckstein said on North German Radio that efforts should be made to
distribute the burden evenly. He reminded listeners that there are up to
15,000 Albanian refugees in Italy now, while Germany alone took in more
than 300,000 Bosnian refugees earlier.

Serious breaches of privacy of information in Schleswig-Holstein
</H1>
The authorities in Schleswig-Holstein allow some serious breaches of
privacy of information, according to a report commissioned by the state.
The author of the report, Baeumler, was hired to see how secure the
information collected for various reasons by the state about its citizens
was against outside prying eyes. Baeumler criticized especially the state
security department of the police, as well as the careless dealing with
sensitive patient files in the health care system. The report did
indicate, however, that much had improved over the last few years.
Baeumler said that he was satisfied, but that it was essential to continue
to monitor the situation.
