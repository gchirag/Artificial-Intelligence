Kinkel criticizes Turkey's human rights policies
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel has expressed criticism of the Turkish
government's latest moves against human rights activists. The arrest of a
Turkish lawyer Yagmurdereli, and the conviction of the president of the
Turkish Human Rights Association, Birdal (sp?) were utterly
incomprehensible, Kinkel said in Bonn. He warned the Turkish government
not to silence its opponents with the letter of the law, adding that such
a move would not only undermine the basis of democracy, but would also
damage Turkey's international standing.
Turkish security forces arrested the blind lawyer last weekend in Istanbul
- scant hours after the awarding of the German Book Dealers' Peace Prize
to the Turkish writer Kemal.

Western German health insurers to help finance Eastern debt
</H1>
The health insurance companies in Western Germany are supposed to
contribute to the financing of the multi-billion Mark debt of their
counterparts in Eastern Germany, after 1999. Federal Health Minister
Seehofer, his Eastern counterparts, and representatives o the insurance
companies today presented a model for a nation-wide risk-equalization
plan. Seehofer said that the Western companies could handle the initial
transfer of DM 1.5 billion without raising premiums. He also indicated
that the companies had promised rigorous savings measures.
Representatives for the CDU/CSU and the SPD welcomed the idea in
principle. Even the SPD's social policy expert, Dressler, said that the
problem could be solved in a non-partisan manner.
On the other hand, Baden-Wuerttemberg Social Minister Vetter announced his
opposition to the plan, on the grounds that it would lead to higher
premiums in the West.
Both the Bundestag and the Bundesrat, where the states are represented,
must approve the changes before they can become law.

Gunther Grass: fears for Turkish writer Kemal
</H1>
German author Gunther Grass fears for the safety of this year's winner of
the German Book Dealers' Peace Prize, the Turkish writer Kemal, following
the latest arrests in that country.
Grass also told the Luebeck Nachrichten newspaper that he hoped his speech
at the award presentation would provide impetus to change "Germany's
miserable and inhumane deportation practices". Both the Eastern and
Western PEN centres declined to disparage Grass for his speech. On the
contrary - in a joint resolution, they welcomed his comments on racism and
xenophobia, as well as Germany's shared guilt for the war against the
Kurds.

Scharping: SPD-led minority government in Saxony-Anhalt working
</H1>
The leader of the federal SPD parliamentary group, Scharping, has
characterized the SPD-led minority government in Saxony-Anhalt as workable
and stable. Speaking in Magdeburg, Scharping said that the model was
functioning, the SPD-Green coalition cooperating with various groups. For
example, they guided 6 bills on internal security through the Landestag
with the help of the CDU, and 7 with the PDS.
At the same time, however, Scharping distanced himself from the PDS,
calling it the most conservative, out-dated, and biologically oldest party
in Germany. The representatives of the PDS in the Saxony-Anhalt Landestag
responded by reproaching Scharping for his "questionable verbal leap". It
is expected that the Saxony-Anhalt Social Democrats will distance
themselves from Scharping's comments.

Fewer enterprises being founded in Eastern Germany
</H1>
Fewer and fewer Eastern Germans are willing to take the risk of starting
their own business. The number of new businesses being found fell by
almost half between 1990 and 1996, according to the Institute for the
German Economy in Berlin. Nevertheless, the first 7 years after the fall
of the Berlin Wall have seen 1.5 million new businesses being registered,
versus only 740,000 de-registered. The Institute indicates that the
service industry appears to be the most attractive on to Eastern German
entrepreneurs.

Mercedes-Benz stops production of the new C-class motor
</H1>
The construction of the new 4-cylinder motor, which was to have powered
the C-class and Roadster SLK vehicles beginning in 1999, has been stopped.
The Daimler-Benz company confirmed the news today in Stuttgart. The reason
for the stoppage is an unexpectedly low fuel-efficiency, which has caused
the management to instigate a re-examination of the motor. When the
re-worked motor will be available is not know. A newspaper report to the
effect that the delay is costing Daimler-Benz hundreds of millions of
Marks in damages is "greatly exaggerate" according to a spokesman for the
company. In any case, a DM 600 million production plant in Stuttgart's
Untertuerkheim area will apparently be left empty for the time being.
