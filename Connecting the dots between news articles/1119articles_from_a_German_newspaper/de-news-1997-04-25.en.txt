Parliament discusses planned tax-reform
</H1>
Today the planned tax-reform went through their first reading in parliament
(Bundestag), two days after talks with the opposition SPD had failed.
The minimum rate of income-tax is to drop from 25.9% to 15%, whereas the
maximum rate is to drop from 53% to 39%. This is meant to ease private and
corporate tax-payers' burden by approx. 84 billion marks. Scrapping
tax-exemptions should pay for 38 billion marks out of the total.

<P>
Government will try and wrap up everything before the summer-recess, if
possible, though the SPD's majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat) will tip
the scales. Mr Lafontaine, head of the SPD, had already stated he would make
sure this draft would be shot down in the Upper House.

Mr Eppelmann: amend planned tax-reform
</H1>
The president of the CDU Workers' Organisation, Mr Rainer Eppelmann,
asked for amendments to government's draft tax-reform. In a
newspaper-interview, Mr Eppelmann referred to taxing penalty-rates, wanting
that to be done bit by bit, so workers would be able to compensate
for the drops in income. And he also wanted government to have a re-think
on taxing life insurances, especially when they were definitely meant for
retirement purposes. Another item up for discussion was the planned
conversion of the existing lump-sum tax-exemption based on actual kilometres
driven to/from work into another lump-sum scheme based on distances.

Upper House: lower benefits for refugees/persons seeking asylum
</H1>
Refugees and persons seeking asylum will be paid only 80% of the social
welfare assistance benefit (Sozialhilfe) for the first 3 years, according to
the Upper House (Bundesrat). But they canned the planned scrapping of tax on
trade-capital, and government's plans to reform the health sector.
The latter was meant to raise the amounts patients would be required to pay
themselves if and when health insurers raised their premiums. And there
was more: patients' excess was to go up once again, and they were to be
levied 20 marks to pay for the maintenance of hospitals. These two laws do
not require the Upper House's consent.

<P>
Trade-capital tax was not ideal, according to Lower Saxony's premier
Schroeder, as it hurt companies with small profits, but it would have to
stay as (federal) government had not offered any compensation for the
resulting reduction in (state) tax-take. Now the Upper House is to propose a
completely new draft: tax on trade-capital will be introduced in former
East Germany, for the time being.

Mixed reactions to Railways' decision to back Transrapid train
</H1>
The SPD parliamentary group said that the financial risks for German
Railways (Bahn AG) would be irresponsibly high, whereas Railways and the
unions were all for it. This morning Transport Minister Wissmann stated
that the magnetic levitation track from Hamburg to Berlin would be built,
in spite of rising costs and lower expected revenue, referring to
Chancellor Kohl and Finance Minister Waigel who allegedly had okayed the
project.

<P>
The project will stay on track, is spite of less favourable predictions.
The number of passengers between Hamburg and Berlin is markedly lower than
forecast earlier on, and revenue as well. The reason being the planned
additional stop at Schwerin: many passengers will then only use part of the
whole route.

<P>
The all-up cost will be about 10 billion marks, and federal government will
foot 6.1 billions of the bill. The project is supported by Thyssen, Siemens
and a joint venture between Daimler and ABB. Another prospective partner,
from the ranks of the construction industry, however, jumped ship. This
would lower costs even more, according to the minister, as now contracts
were open to tender. He also was sure his government would get a return for
their investment through revenue from ticket-sales. And he thought the new
financial concept was reliable: "At the same time we're demonstrating to the
world that Germany is competitive, while finding the optimum solution
for the German tax-payer". Work on the magnetic levitation train project is
to begin this year.

Unions and Allies agree to redundancy clauses for civilian staff
</H1>
The union for Public Service and Transport Workers (OeTV) and the Allies'
armed forces agreed to protect their 35,000 non-sworn civilian staff against
redundancies due to rationalisation, and according to the union, the
draft only wants to be signed. In case the Allies were to shed staff, they
would have to offer them re-deployment in equivalent or similar jobs.
Redundancy-payments were to be the last resort. In the last few days several
thousand staff had gone on strike, demonstrating against redundancies.
The term 'Allies' includes the armed forces of the USA, Great Britain,
France and Belgium.

Germany wants to have a break while UN is sitting under urgency
</H1>
New York. For the first time in 15 years the UN sat under urgency, debating
if Israel's re-settling policies were to be condemned. A group of Arab
member-states had passed a remit asking for an immediate halt to new
settlements in East Jerusalem, plus pleading with UN-members not to support
in any way Israel's illegal activities in the occupied Palestinian regions
including Jerusalem. They want to make sure Israel will deploy neither police
nor armed forces nor invest in the areas until a final treaty has been
negotiated. Meanwhile Germany asked for a break: according to the news agency
AFP, Germany was unable to agree to the clause that would have put a stop to
all aid Israel might use for settlement policies. Other sources claim,
however, that the Arab countries had dropped this requirement in order not
to jeopardise Israel's indictment by the UN.

Mr Meier new president of Central Committee of German Catholics
</H1>
A big majority of votes made sure Saxony's minister of economic
affairs, Mr Meier, was elected as new president of the central Committee of
German Catholics, succeeding Ms Rita Waschbuesch who did not run again.
Mr Meier is the first East German heading the organisation. He asked
them to take up social Catholicism's 'unblinkered' view of reality and
develop it further.

Courts will be kept busy by Boettcher case
</H1>
The state prosecution said they would fight the verdict and appeal
to the Federal Court of Justice (Bundesgerichtshof), and the co-plaintiff
will follow suit. Yesterday defence counsel stated that they would appeal
against the decision not to compensate Ms Boettcher for the years spent in
jail. In 1988 Ms Monika Boettcher, nee Weimar, had been sentenced to life
imprisonment for having killed her two daughters. Yesterday the Frankfurt
Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht) acquitted Ms Boettcher in a
re-trial.

14. Congress of Association of German Writers
</H1>
The outgoing president of the Association of German Writers, Mr
Loest, criticised his fellow writers, claiming contemporary writers were too
self-tormenting, and their works too parochial. At the same time he
claimed that there was a lack of support by government. Mr Loest will not
run again, so the only candidate, Mr Breimersdorfer of the Baden-Wuerttemberg
Writers' Association, will probably be elected.

Less and less ethnic Germans immigrate to Germany
</H1>
When interviewed by the newspaper HEILBRONNER STIMME, the Federal
Commissioner for Ethnic German Immigrants, Mr Waffenschmidt, said that
the number of immigrants/month was down by 6,000, compared to two years ago,
the reason being gloomy work- and housing prospects.

Tic Tac Toe stays Tic Tac Toe
</H1>
The band Tic Tac Toe may keep their name, according to an out-of-court
settlement between their agents and their 'namesake', a Hamburg advertising
agency. The stroppy band from Germany's heavy industry area around the river
Ruhr will be able to continue rehearsing using their old trademark, though
no-one was telling how much money was involved. The background: after reports
about the suicide of one of the female singers and other reports on alleged
sleaze involving the band, the Hamburg agency obtained an injunction banning
the band from using the name Tic Tac Toe, claiming that scandals and
resulting headlines were hurting the agency's reputation. In 1994 the agency
had trademarked the name, but had agreed to let the all-girls band use it
provided they paid them some tens of thousands of marks. The present
out-of-court settlement most certainly meant that the Hamburg agency
'double-dipped'.
