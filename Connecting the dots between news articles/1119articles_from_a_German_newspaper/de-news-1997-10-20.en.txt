Turkish press reacts positively to prize bestowed on Kemal
</H1>
The bestowal of the Peace Prize of German Book Dealers' Association
on Turkish writer Yazar Kemal made headlines in Turkey today. In his tribute
speech at Frankfurt's Paulskirche, Guenter Grass had annoyed the federal
government by criticising prevalent German policies on asylum and on Turkey.
Comments in the Turkish press included, "A prize that fills us with pride",
"This prize moves us", "Turkey is proud of you. We have to do away with the
shameful association between opinion and prison", "Kemal and Grass criticised
their respective countries and opened the debate on those massacres. We should
take that to heart and not just scold Grass for criticising Turkish policy
toward Kurds."
None of the papers ignored the criticism of the Turkish policy on Kurds and
German immigration policy voiced during the Paulskirche celebration. But there
was only spare and isolated comment on Grass's charges referring to German arms
shipments to Turkey.
