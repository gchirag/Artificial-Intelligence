Gerhardt defends Henkel
</H1>
Comprehensive collective wage agreements remain in the news. The
President of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) Mr. Gerhardt defended Mr.
Henkel, the President of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) on
"Deutschlandfunk" radio. Mr. Henkel had praised managers in the East
German states who do not honor collective wage agreements. According to
Mr. Gerhardt, this is proof in itself that the comprehensive collective
wage agreements need to be reformed. In an interview with the weekly
"Focus", Mr. Henkel rejected criticism by social politicians within the
Christian Democratic Union and said, Germany needs either a Margaret
Thatcher or, as in Holland, a decision to relieve businesses in order to
create jobs. Mr. Henkel said some government officials seem to think that
they have a monopoly on the economy and can now score points with the
media by participating in scapegoating businesses. He continued that
instead of criticizing entrepreneurs, Minister of Labor Norbert Bluem
should do his own job and work on reforms to create more jobs. There had
always been people like Mr. Bluem in high places, he said, however, Mr.
Bluem was now playing the role of court jester in Bonn.

Before the strike in East German steel industry...
</H1>
One week before the announced start of the strike in the East German
steel industry, the Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics has
again called on employers to make concessions. The President of the Union
Districts Berlin, Brandenburg and Saxony stressed in an interview with
the news agency "ap" that his Union will not allow wages in the East to
be independent of those in the West. He said that he cannot comprehend
the position of employers, as the East German steel industry is
expanding. He accused employers of trying to turn East Germany into a low
wage area. The Union wants to expand the West German steel industry's
collective wage agreement to include the approximately 8000 employees of
the district for a wage increase of 2.6 percent and a one-off payment.

are anchored along the Turkish coast ready to leave for Italy. From there

</H1>
The Taxpayers' Association has demanded that the flat-rate
exemption for Members of Parliaments' expenses be abolished. Mr. Lau, the
Vice President of the organization told the "Bild am Sonntag" that it is
was annoying that Members of Parliament are permitted a flate-rate
deduction for expenses of 75,000 marks per year, whereas other tax payers
have to prove the validity of each business or professional expenditure
with a receipt. The reason for Mr. Lau's criticism is that the flat rate
will increase by about 100 marks to 6235 marks per month at the beginning
of the year.

patterns for their decision in the election. However, he continued, this
does not mean that the churches are neutral. They have to takes sides on
issues and generally be on the side of the weak, Mr. Kock said.
