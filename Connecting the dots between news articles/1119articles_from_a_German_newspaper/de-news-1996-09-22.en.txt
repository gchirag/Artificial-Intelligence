SPD wants to push through raise of child benefits
</H1>
According to Hamburg's Mayor Voscherau, the Social Democratic
Party wants to push through a raise of child benefits. In an interview with
the radio station "Sueddeutscher Rundfunk" Voscherau said that the SPD is
not willing to put off the raise of child benefits on the backs of millions
of families. In contrast, the Social Democrats are willing to discuss the
other issues of the tax package. For example, it is predictable that the
SPD will not be able to keep up resistance against an abolition of the
wealth tax. Voscherau represents his party in the talks with German Finance
Minister Waigel about the annual tax regulations.

Council of German Chambers of Commerce for smaller government
</H1>
In the view of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, DIHT, parliament
and government should use their move to Berlin as an opportunity to tighten
the administration. In a paper published today DIHT demands that the state
get rid of unnecessary ballast and concentrate on its real tasks. DIHT also
recommends that the state withdraw from the role of an enterprise on all
levels, combining Ministries and privatizing many public services like
garbage collection and energy supply. On the other hand, privatized public
enterprises like Telekom have to be kept from abusing their former monopoly
to gain market advantages.

Engelen-Kefer for general reduction of working hours
</H1>
In the opinion of the vice president of the Association of German Unions,
Engelen-Kefer, a general reduction of working hours could not only create
new jobs but involve men stronger in domestic duties. During an event in
Kassel Mrs. Engelen-Kefer said today that achievements of equal rights
politics are now being rolled back little by little. Compatibility of
career and family continues to be the central problem for women.
Engelen-Kefer suggested that the three year child-care leave be transformed
into a flexible parent leave which could be used like a time account by
both parents.
