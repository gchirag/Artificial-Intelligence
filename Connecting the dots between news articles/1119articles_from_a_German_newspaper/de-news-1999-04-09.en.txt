President Yeltsin threatens to intervene
</H1>
He had never been that blunt before, but today Russian president Yeltsin
took the cake when speaking out against NATO's airstrikes. In case
Yugoslavia got invaded by ground-troops and the invaders set up a
'protectorate' there, Russia would intervene, according to agency reports.
Mr Yeltsin said on television that he had warned NATO, the Americans and
the Germans that there could be a European or even World War if his country
got dragged into the conflict.

<P>
The US, however, stated that high-ranking Moscow officials had reassured
them once again on Friday afternoon, that they would not intervene.
Meanwhile NATO spokesperson Shea told Russia that NATO did not plan an
invasion of the Kosovo.

More air-raids on Friday
</H1>
Airstrikes kept going, also during orthodox Good Friday, and in the evening
sirens sounded again in Belgrade. Several hundred people gathered on the main
bridge over the river Save, to protect it against airstrikes ('human
shields'). According to Belgrade, fuel depots, factories and TV-stations
were hit last Friday night, and there had been casualties in industrial
areas.

NATO admits to bombing-error
</H1>
Last Thursday a bomb hit a residential area in the provincial capital of
Pristina, according to NATO. Airforce Commander Wilby stated that the
precision device had been deflected and therefore had hit houses some 200
to 300 metres from the intended target (the central telephone exchange).
He said he was sorry, though there was no way NATO could be responsible for
all the damage caused in Pristina's residential areas, as Serb leaders
claimed.

Chancellor Schroeder adamant there will be no ground-troops
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder once again declined to send ground-troops to the
Balkan. In a recent interview on television he stated that government saw
no reason why they should change their current strategy, and that was it.
Defence Minister Scharping and Foreign Minister Fischer agreed. General
Naumann, head of the German NATO military committee, said that sending
ground-troops still was a theoretical option. Politicians would have to
decide on that, after evaluating the situation.

applying for asylum in Germany, according to Federal Minister for Internal
Affairs Schily. Numbers were 2736, that's 8.6% up on last month - 84%
of them calling themselves Kosovo-Albanians - but the numbers had been

8.1% compared to February. There will be 2000 more refugees from the Kosovo
till Saturday.

14-million mark study halted by Minister Trittin
</H1>
Federal Environment Minister Trittin has halted work on a 14-million mark
study about nuclear power-plants using pressurised water for cooling. He said
that there was no need for this project any more, as nuclear power generation
was on its way out in Germany. The paper was meant to develop safety
requirements for future nuclear power-plants. Since 1989 both France and
Germany had been involved in the project.
