Mr Eichel wants to soldier on as far as budget-cuts are concerned
</H1>
Federal government will soldier on, as far as budget-cuts are concerned,
regardless of any lobbying, as Finance Minister Eichel said. The
SPD-politician said in Bonn that there was an obligation to put the
financial house in order. It would be irresponsible and antisocial to leave
the next generation with a state that was burdened with too much debt.
Mr Eichel also announced that cabinet would decide on the matter on
25 August.

</H1>

in case the existing Red-Green coalition broke up. When interviewed on ZDF

No way to solve stock-feed scandal
</H1>
There probably is no way to determine if stock-feed containing sludge, or
animals that had been fed the mixture, had been imported from France. The

Ms Steffi Graf calls it quits
</H1>
Today Ms Steffi Graf called it quits, after a tennis career spanning 17
years. In the middle of December there is to be a farewell tour, starting
with South Africa. Ms Graf won 22 Grand-Slam tournaments, she was number 1
in the world-rankings for 377 weeks, a unique tennis-career indeed. After
the San Diego tournament she had lost interest in playing tennis, something
she had already realised when flying out to San Diego. "After Wimbledon
there's nothing left for me to achieve." Ms Graf said that her decision had
been a relief for her, though she would not be drawn on what she planned to
do in the future.

Mostly respect for Ms Graf's decision
</H1>
The Women's World Tennis Association regretted that one of the sport's
darlings called it quits. Many top sportspeople and other prominent persons
respected her decision. It was a sad day, however, for former coach of the
ladies Mr Klaus Hofses, but he was glad about her graceful exit. Ms Graf
was the best female tennis-player of all times, according to him.

<P>
Mr Franz Beckenbauer called Ms Graf one of the best players in German
history. Her decision was a pity, but had to be respected.

<P>
Baden-Wuerttemberg State Premier Teufel said Ms Graf was one of the state's
most popular persons. Her success had helped raise Germany's perception in
the rest of the world.

<P>
Mr Walter Troeger, president of the German Olympic Committee, praised
Ms Graf for having kept going, even after she had reached  the summit of her
career. Every sportsperson should be free to decide how long they wanted to
enjoy to keep going.
