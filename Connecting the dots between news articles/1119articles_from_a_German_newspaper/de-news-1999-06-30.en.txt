German Army finds signs of atrocities in its sector of Kosovo
</H1>
78 corpses have been found by German soldiers in the sector of Kosovo
under their control. As the spokesman for the German KFOR contingent in
Prizren announced, the dead were obviously victims of a massacre. The
bodies were found in a village 15 kilometres away. The UN War Crimes
Tribunal in The Hague said that the atrocities committed by Serbian units
had probably been carefully planned in advance. The systematic destruction
of villages in Kosovo lent support to that idea.

Roestel, Radcke: End debate over direction of Green Party
</H1>
The leadership of the German Greens have called for an end to the debate
over the direction of the party. Executive spokesmen for the party, Gunda
Roestel and Antje Radcke, also rejected demands by Green Bundestag
representatives Oswald Metzger and Christine Scheel that Environment
Minister Juergen Trittin resign. Trittin, taking a shot at his critics,
said that those occupied solely with navel-gazing were not fit to govern.
Today in Bonn, members of the left wing of the party presented a
counter-proposal to the 'modernization paper' recently published by 40
members of the Green Party. Today's paper, titled "Away from the New
Center", warns against moving closer to the positions of the FDP, and says
that the party's primary goal must be greater social justice.

Bundestag: health reform, career training report
</H1>
In the first reading of the planned health reform, the Opposition accused
the Government of endangering the provision of medical care in Germany.
CDU/CSU and FDP representatives spoke of a two-tiered health-care system,
and suggested that patient treatment would in future depend upon the
budgets of the various health-care insurance plans. Health Minister Andrea
Fischer again rejected such suggestions. She emphasized that the goal of
the reform was to secure quality in the health-care system and to
stabilize the contribution rates.
The Bundestag also debated the 1999 career training report. Education and
Research Minister Edelgard Bulmahn indicated that she was unhappy with the
number of apprenticeship positions in Eastern Germany. She told parliament
that structural reforms and support measures must go further; also,
training programs must be more modern, practical, and flexible. The
federal government expects about 690,000 young people to be looking for
apprenticeships this autumn. The Confederation of German Employers'
Associations announced today in Cologne that business would offer an
apprenticeship to every young person seeking one this year.

Boris Becker retires from tennis
</H1>
Boris Becker has ended his professional tennis career. Following his
defeat in the eight-finals at Wimbledon by Australian Patrick Rafter, the
six-time Grand Slam winner announced that it had been his last match. He
will now not play in the up-coming Stuttgart tournament as planned. Becker
lost to Rafter with 3:6, 2:6, and 3:6. That leaves Steffi Graf as the last
German in the Wimbledon tournament. She will next face the American Venus
Williams in the quarter-finals.

Continued disagreement over withdrawal from nuclear energy
</H1>
The timing of a withdrawal from nuclear energy apparently continues to
cause disunity within the SPD-Green coalition. Sources within the Green
Party indicate that a meeting between Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
Economic Minister Werner Mueller, and Environment Minister Juergen Trittin
in the Chancellery last night failed to result in an agreement on a new
offer to the nuclear industry of when final shut-downs should occur.
Mueller had previously suggested a period of 35 years before taking the
last nuclear power plants off-line.

No exclusion zone around parliament in future
</H1>
After the move of the German parliament to Berlin, the previous 'exclusion
zone', which banned demonstrations within a certain distance of the
parliament and government buildings, will be abolished. The SPD-Green
majority pushed the decision through the Bundestag tonight. Instead of the
exclusion zone, 'protest areas' will be created, which will allow
demonstrations immediately in front of parliament, as long as no serious
disruptions are to be expected.
