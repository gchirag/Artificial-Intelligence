Christmas address by President Herzog
</H1>
In his Christmas address, German President Roman Herzog called for
more humaneness between fellow citizens in daily life. This attitude
can not be replaced by even the best welfare state, Mr Herzog said.
A really humane society distinguishes itself in particular by tolerance.
This means not to consider people who are different as being a burden
but a chance for enrichement. The President also warned against the
exclusion of the unemployed and discrimination against the ill and
the handicapped. Instead, a "real neighbourhood" is needed where
each individual is willing to take more social responsibility than
laws and rules require.

<P>
The translation of the full text of the address will be appended at one
of the next issues of DE-News.

UNHCR acknowledges Germany's help for Bosnian war refugees
</H1>

acknowledges Germany's humanitarian efforts in the temporal
accomodation of 320,000 Bosnian war refugees. UNHCR representative at
Bonn, Ms Cumin (sp?), expressed the hope that the return of these people
will be dominated by humanity, too. Nonetheless, humitarian aid should
not be misunderstood as replacement for political solutions.

<P>

in Germany and for people who are seeking asylum in Germany because of
non-governmental persecution in their home country.

Schorlemmer demands inner-German solidarity
</H1>
An all-German solidarity for under-priviledged citizens in the East and
the West of Germany has been demanded by former East-German civil rights
activist and pastor Friedrich Schorlemmer. Today, the fact that some become
richer and richer and others poorer and poorer is a problem of all Germans,
said Mr Schorlemmer. To prevent a split up of society it is absolutely
necessary to reconsider this question.

<P>
The Vice-President of the Committee for the Poor in Germany, Ms Bien,
reproached politicians of all parties with failing in the fight against
poverty. For a long period of time, people who already have money have
been supported, but not those who need help urgently, said Ms Bien. She
also rejected the opinion of the Federal government that social welfare
assistance is a means to fight poverty. The recipients are already poor,
Ms Bien stressed.

Commissioner for the handicapped calls for more commitment
</H1>
The Federal government's commissioner for the handicapped,
Mr Regenspurger, has called for more commitment to the handicapped.
The CSU-politician said at Christmas one should make up one's mind on
how to help handicapped people. Also, one has to thank those who aid
or support handicapped people, be it voluntarily, professionally or within
the compulsory social service. The commitment of social servants
deserves a particular acknowledgement, said Mr Regenspurger. Calls to
destroy the system of mandatory military or social service are problematic
and unserious enough for this reason.

"Flight scandal": SPD supports Suessmuth
</H1>
In the scandal about alleged private flights with planes of the
Armed Forces, President of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament)
Rita Suessmuth (CDU) gets support from the Social Democrats (SPD). Member
of Parliament, Mr Duwe, called the allegations a campaign and "fatale
attacts" against Ms Suessmuth. Due to the busy schedule of many politicians,
official and private lifes are often linked closely even at weekends,
said Mr Duwe. The Representatives of Parliament should be protected
against such revilements. Mr Duwe criticised that other users of the
flight service of the Armed Forces did not support Ms Suessmuth.

<P>
Ms Suessmuth reiterated her opinion that she does not have to blame herself
for anything. She can answer for all her trips she stressed in a newspaper
interview.

Engelen-Kefer against new summit with the Chancellor
</H1>
Vice head of national trade union federation Ursula
Engelen-Kefer is against a new round of "Chancellor talks" to fight
unemployment. Unions do not support new "Chancellor talks" at the moment.
At Deutschlandfunk radio station, Ms Engelen-Kefer said the prerequisites
for further talks with employers and politicians do not exist for the
time being. The President of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce,
Mr Stihl proposed yesterday a new round of "Chancellor talks".

<P>
Ms Engelen-Kefer added there are many problems that employers and employees
could and should resolve outside of "Chancellor talks", as for example
the decrease of overtime work and the shortage of job training places.

Retail trade: social insurance duty for all jobs would be disastrous
</H1>
The introduction of social insurance duty for so-called Dm590 jobs
(that is, jobs earning less then Dm590 per month) would have disastrous
consequences for the entire retail sector. The General Executive Manager of
the Federation of retail firms, Mr Wenzel said this morning at
Deutschlandfunk radio station, the discussion of this matter is highly
unpleasant. He underlined, that this extra duty would not be of any
help for employees. Mr Wenzel also said the retail sector did not create
a high number of new jobs after the change to longer business hours.

Christmas sermon of EKD president
</H1>
The hectic atmosphere during the preparations for Christmas
and the crowd in the department stores contradict the meaning of Christmas,
said the President of the Synod of protestant churches in Germany (EKD),
Mr Engelhardt. In his sermon at Christmas Eve at the city church at
Karlsruhe-Durlach, the Bishop said something that is exposed that easily
as Christmas kitsch is just the expression of a longing for a harmonic
world. Nobody should believe that Christmas can be celebrated only by
those who are in a settled mood.
