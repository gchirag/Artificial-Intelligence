Refugee claims no longer to onerate Czech-German relations
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder and Czech premier Zeman do not want further
impairment of relations between the two countries through WWII refugee
claims. This was sterssed by both following a Bonn meeting. In
Schroeder's opinion, claims from the ranks of Sudeten Germans belong
to another era on which the books are closed. Things like that must
not weigh on German foreign policy.  Zeman spoke of a new beginning in
Czech-German relations.

Refugees criticize Schroeder's pronunciations on claims
</H1>
The Refugee Association's reaction was one of shocked dismay. Its
chairwoman Steinbach said what Schroeder said today was the opposite
of all information supplied by the new federal government to date.

become legally responsible for indemnities. CSU also voiced criticism
of Schroeder's promouncement.

Lafontaine considering improvements in tax reform laws
</H1>
Finance minister Lafontaine does not exclude the possibility ofcertain
tax reliefs for the power sector. Should the government's projections
prove themselves wrong by a considerable degree, corrective measures
might be taken at a later date. Power companies foresee an additional
tax load to the tune of DM 25 bln.

<P>
Minister for economy Mueller holds that the companies need to get
positive signals. In an interview to the daily "Sueddeutsche Zeitung"

Tax union foresees that tax reforms will highly increase expenditure
</H1>
The tax reform as planned might call for an increase in the German
internal revenue service headcount by some 2,000. So says the German
tax union. As new employees will probably not be admitted, the
overload would needs lead to lesser quality in service. As an example,
they said that the planned cutting savings exemptions by half would
not only increase work in the service, but also force citizens to fill
out yet another attachment to their wage tax reports.

Party chairmen accuse one another over collaboration with PDS
</H1>
Quarrelling about the political collaboration ebtween SPD and PDS goes
on and on. CDU chairman Schaeuble accused SPD chairman Lafontaine of
preparing collaboration with SPD on the federal level, e.g., in the
Bundesrat (upper house). Over ARD-TV he said last night that political
reponsibility should not be shared with PDS.  Lafontaine countered
that Schaeuble was speculating on PDS support for the union parties'
candidate Ms. Schipanski in the upcoming presidential election. He
said Schaeuble was well aware that a majority for Ms.  Schipanski in
the Bundesversammlung (the presidential electoral college) could only
come about with the support of both SPD and right-wing radicals.
Chancellor Schroeder, in a clarifying statement over radio
Deutschlandfunk during the weekend, had said that his opposition to
cooperation with PDS on a federal level did not apply to the
Bundesrat. There, he said, not the parties, but rather the states were
represented.

Schily said to be working out citizenship compromise with FDP
</H1>
The federal government goes ahead trying to find a formula on
citizenship laws that might get approved by the Bundesrat. The daily
"Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" claims to have found out that
minister of internal affairs Schily had worked out a the foundation
for a compromise solution with FDP vice chairman Bruederle. It would
basically entitle all alien children born on German soil to obtain a
German passport. At age 21, at the latest, they would then have to opt
for their definitive nationality.  The government hope that by
negotiating with FDP they might obtain the needed support of
Rhenania/Palatinate in the Bundesrat.  Meanwhile, CDU chairman
Schaeuble reiterated his party's willingness to help in finding a
compromise solution. But, he said to "Berliner Zeitung", the
collection of signatures would go on until the Bonn government
abandoned the general acceptance of dual citizenship.

Old age insurance not always deductible from unemployment compensation
</H1>
Reserves laid back for old age security by long term unemployed
persons cannot generally be considered towards reducing the amount of
unemployment compensation. This is the gist of a decision handed down
by the federal labor court in Kassel today. The judges argued that it
should be possible to maintain teh habitual standard of living after
retirement. This means that a nest egg providing interest sufficient
to bridge the gap between retirement pay and average wages can not be
used as a reducing factor in calculating compensation payments.

ADAC criticizes EU plan for Europe-wide driving ban
</H1>
The European Union's plan to enforce driving bans Europewide is under
heavy attack from German automobile club ADAC. Decisions by foreign
judges were no longer subject to reviewal by German authorities. A
general driving ban in the home country might in the future be applied
due to minor infractions. E.g.: In Italy, one can lose one's driver's
license for wrong use of the emergency lane.  The scenario is provided
by an agreement among EU transportation ministers, up for being voted
into law by the Bundestag.
