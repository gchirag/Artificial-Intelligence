Green Party Convention
</H1>
Alliance 90/The Greens have renewed their appeal for a change
in policy in Bonn. During a small party convention in Germering near
Munich, Party Speaker Gunda Roestel declared that the red-green coalition
is the only chance for a fresh start in German politics. Ms. Roestel
attacked the federal government sharply. She said that the government's
claim that the economy is in an upswing "socio-politically obscene". She
accused Finance Minister Theo Waigel of whitewashing the budget, and
Minister of Employment Norbert Bluem of falsifying unemployment
statistics. Ms. Roestel promised to work towards a "Coalition for Work"
and to look for unconventional solutions in employment politics should
the Green party be part of the government in Bonn . Among other things,
she demanded that employment be distributed more justly. Party Speaker
Juergen Trittin campaigned for the party-list vote, and Parliamentary
Party Leader Joschka Fischer stressed the party's main goal which is to
combat unemployment. Mr. Fischer would like to finance this via an
ecological tax reform which would mean higher prices for energy. Fischer
promised to push this proposal through should there be a red-green
coalition. He said that Gerhard  Schroeder would have to come to terms
with this. Fischer refused to accept conditions for coalition talks
saying that humiliation would not contribute towards successful
collaboration.
