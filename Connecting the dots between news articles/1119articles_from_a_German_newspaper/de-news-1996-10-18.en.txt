Solidarity-surtax not to be lowered yet
</H1>
The solidarity-surtax will not be lowered from currently 7.5% to 6.5%, as of
next year, as planned. Federal Finance Minister Waigel told the press that
the government coalition-partners had agreed to postpone that for a year,
so another 3 billion marks had to be raised by cuts to expenses. Investment
expenses should be exempt, as far as possible, and he also ruled out any
major additional cuts in the social and welfare sector.

<P>
Government claimed that the SPD - who have a majority in the Upper House
(Bundesrat) - was to blame for the deficits. By insisting on not postponing
the raise of child-benefits, government had no choice but cut the surtax a
year later.

Upper House (Bundesrat) against amendment to marital rape law
</H1>
The Upper House (Bundesrat) blocked a planned amendment to the law on
marital rape, objecting to the so-called veto-clause. The latter would allow
the wife to put a stop to proceedings against her husband at any time, even
at the 11th hour. The SPD-governed states thought the clause was just
another means to bully the wife. The Lower House (Bundestag) now needs 337
votes to overturn the  Upper House's decision. If they do not succeed, the
law will remain as is, otherwise it will get amended accordingly.

<P>
The Upper House also voted on a draft to simplify trials, meant to take the
heat off overworked civil matters courts. And they also agreed to
government's draft to fight corruption.

</H1>
Today parliament passed the law on adapting rents in East Germany, a law
that is meant to alleviate any rises in the case of low-income families.
The new law will come into force on 1 January 1997. At the same time current
special rent-subsidies for East Germany will come to an end.

<P>
Previously the governing coalition parties had passed another draft making
sure holiday- and Christmas-pay would continue to be subject to compulsory
social-security deductions.

Decision on more locks on Danube postponed
</H1>
Federal and Bavarian governments postponed the decision on the
controversial upgrading of the Danube (more locks) until the year 2000.
Federal Transport Minister Wissmann, who had met with Bavaria's State
Premier Stoiber, said that common sense had prevailed. Building locks on
the Danube within the last free-flow stretch in Germany, should be done
respecting ecological sensitivity. There would be minor projects in 1998
and 1999, to improve the waterway for commercial barges.

First partial confession in Fiszmann kidnapping
</H1>
One of the alleged kidnappers of Mr Fiszmann made a partial
confession. The 26-year old man admitted that he, together with his father,
had kidnapped the businessman, and driven him to a forest in the Taunus
near Frankfurt, three days after the actual kidnapping. When they were in
the forest, his father allegedly had said that he wanted to get rid of
Mr Fiszmann, somehow. The father denied that. Police were still searching
the area, though - in spite of using heat-sensors on Air Force planes -
were unsuccessful so far.

For the first time Berlin Vietnamese cigarette-mafia members go to jail
</H1>
This was the first time members of the Vietnamese cigarette-mafia were
sentenced to life imprisonment. They had killed a cigarette-pusher in cold
blood. The trial made the headlines as this was the first time a witness
for the prosecution did stick to his testimony. Previously many witnesses
had been intimidated, so they had recanted.
The court was convinced that the two perpetrators had executed one of
their colleagues on 20 March in front of a Berlin-Marzahn supermarket.
The man they had killed supposedly had started contacting a rival
mafia-gang, and the murder was meant to be a deterrent, according to
investigations. This was the first time the Berlin judiciary was successful,
in as many as 39 killings in the past, and they also had a Vietnamese chief
witness. The man had been a friend of the killed person, and as an
eye-witness to the execution, had been able to identify the killers. He now
is under witness-protection to avoid revenge-killings such as the ones that
had taken place in the past under similar circumstances.

Investigations on arms-cache near Lindau/Bavaria
</H1>
Lindau/Lake Constance. At the beginning of the week the authorities
had found an arms-cache near a farm close to Lindau, and are now
investigating any possible connections with right-wing radicals. A
spokes-person for the Head Revenue Office (Oberfinanzdirektion) in Munich
said they had found plenty of national-socialist material. They would take
it that the 34-year old man, remanded in custody, had repeatedly met members
of an unknown right-wing radical group. Neighbouring Baden-Wuerttemberg was
also investigating right-wing groups in their state.
