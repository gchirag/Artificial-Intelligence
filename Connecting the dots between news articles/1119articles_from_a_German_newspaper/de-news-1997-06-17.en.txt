Remembrance of national uprising on June 17, 1953
</H1>
Politicians of all parties remembered today the national uprising
in the G.D.R. on June 17, 1953. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said history had
proven all those right who had been fighting for freedom and unity. At the
central remembrance ceremony for the victims of the uprising, in Berlin,
Federal Construction Minister Klaus Toepfer said that freedom had to be
continually defended against intolerance and radicalism. The uprising
had not failed but had been brought to a succesful end in the peaceful
revolution in autumn 1989. Mr Toepfer said June 17 should not become a
day of memories that are slowly fading away - he called for building a
memorial for the victims. Head of Berlin government Eberhard Diepgen said
the Berlin Senat will soon invite entries for an architectural competition
for such a memorial. Former East-German anti-government activist,
Ms Lengsfeld, said the events of June 17 had proven that the East-German
state had never been legitimated by its people.
At the uprising in the G.D.R. 44 years ago, up to 300,000 people took part.

Negotiations on new EU treaty
</H1>
Heads of EU states and governments negotiated a new treaty
for the union. This new treaty is supposed to enable the union to reform
and expand. Among other things a German request to keep unanimous voting
on issues concerning immigration was agreed to, as opposed to a similar
request concerning job creation policies.

<P>
Additions made yesterday to the EU stability treaty, however, have cited
various reactions in Germany. Head of the German Federation of Unions
Dieter Schulte called the additions useful. Now, job creation policies
had the same weight as monetary stability issues. The Federation of German
Industry (BDI) and the employers' confederation have also welcomed the
new treaty. However, BDI's head Hans-Olaf Henkel remarked that the
additions concerning job creation policies might result in Germany
transferring more money to Brussels. Representatives of the CDU,
CSU, SPD and FDP parties have also made positive comments on the
treaty, as opposed to the head of the OeTV union, Mr Mey. In view of
18 million unemployed persons EU wide he expected more commitment to
this question, Mr Mey criticised.

Mr Klement intends to succeed Johannes Rau
</H1>
North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister of Economics, Mr Klement,
intends to succeed Johannes Rau as State Premier. When Mr Rau resigns
he will apply for election at the appropriate party committee, the SPD
politician said today. He wanted to continue to serve North Rhine-
Westphalia. His statement is seen as a reaction to reports of an
alleged conspiracy of leading SPD politicians against him becoming
State Premier. The succession of Mr Rau would not be decided by only
a few but by the entire party, Mr Klement said. At a meeting of the
SPD faction in the State parliament, Mr Rau supported Mr Klement as
his successor. Mr Rau has been elected until 2000.

Acquittals in third child abuse trial at Worms
</H1>
In the third trial of alleged child abuse cases in Worms, the last
eleven defendants have also been acquitted. The court was convinced of the
innocence of the defendants who claimed that there had been no instances
of group child abuse. Only six of the sixteen children might have been
individually subjected to abuse.  However the court did not have to deal
with these cases in the trial. While pronouncing the verdict, Judge Richter
criticised big mistakes made by the public prosecutor: the children had been
pushed to statements by suggestive questioning - no child had made any
spontaneous statement. The children had rather been victims of the
proceedings than victims of abuse.

Arson attack at church in Husum: suspect arrested
</H1>
After an arson attack on the Church of Christ (Christuskirche),
police arrested a suspect today. According to the Public Prosecutor's
office, the 44-year old man has admitted that he had been near the

prosecutor said. In the evening, a judge decided at a committal hearing
to send the suspect to a psychiatric clinic.

was destroyed. This was the third attack on a northern German church
