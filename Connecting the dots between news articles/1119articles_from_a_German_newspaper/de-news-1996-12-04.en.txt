Government's health insurance plans meet with rejection
</H1>
The Federal Government coalition's reform plans for health insurance
have been rejected by the majority of representatives at a hearing
before the Health Comitttee of the Bundestag lower house. Health
insurers, trade unions, doctors and welfare organisations were critical
of the proposals and said they were designed to undermine the principle
of solidarity. Furthermore, the mooted transformation of statutory
services into so-called "Gestaltungsleistungen" (offering more
flexibility) was not the right way to lower health care costs. The
company-owned health insurers were the only group of those present at
the hearing to be of the opinion that the proposal was right in
principle. The pharmaceutical industry and employer organisations
alse welcomed the measures.

Compromise near in Lower Saxony metals industry wage talks
</H1>
In the wage bargaining conflict for the metals and engineering sector in
Lower Saxony, both parties announced they had found some common ground
after a hastily scheduled first meeting. No details were made available.
Negotiator for the employers Niemsch said he was hopeful that the "IG
Metall" union and the employers would be able to come up with a
precedence agreement during the night. A major sticking point is
paid sick leave, along with a wage rise for next year. Wage bargaining
talks on these issues have not been successful so far in
Baden-Wuerttemberg and North Rhine-Westphalia.

Bahlsen employees to retain full paid sick leave
</H1>
The employees of Hanover biscuit maker Bahlsen will keep on receiving
full paid sick leave benefits. After 15 hours of negotiations, that is
the result of talks between the company and the "Nahrung, Genuss,
Gaststaetten" (food, luxury food, gastronomy) union. The agreement is
the first company-internal wage accord in Bahlsen's history. One
restriction on the paid sick leave is the requirement of having been a
Bahlsen employee for at least 7 months. The union announced it was to
end its strike action, which had dragged on for 10 days. Meanwhile, the
Luebeck Labour Court yesterday ruled that a strike at the plant of
marzipan manufacturer Niederegger ist unlawful. The judges said the
cancellation of paid sick leave did not mean the termination of the
general wage bargaining agreement. This meant that the "obligation to
keep the peace" on the wage bargaining partners remained in force.

Neubauer defends position of Sudetenland Germans Association
</H1>
President of the Association of Sudeten-Germans Neubauer has reiterated
his organisation's position on the planned German-Czech reconciliation
declaration. Speaking on "Deutschlandfunk" public radio this morning,
Neubauer said he did not know the wording of the new agreement between
the two governments. Talks with the Federal Government however were of
little use if everything had already been decided, he added. If this
were the case, then once again a binding decision had been reached
without consultation of those affected by it, Neubauer said. He again
emphasised that the Sudeten-Germans wanted their expulsion to be called
an "injustice".

Schmidbauer defends cooperation with Mauss
</H1>
Secret Service Coordinator Schmidbauer has defended himself against the
opposition's accusation of having engaged in "parallel foreign policy"
in the Mauss affair. During parliament question time today, the
Minister of State at the Chancellor's Officer called the charge "moronic
conjecture". Foreign Minister Kinkel supported his actions fully and
shared the political responsibility for them, Schmidbauer continued. He
justified the cooperation with controversial private investigator Mauss
during the freeing of hostages in Colombia as humanitarian aid, and said
he would always use unconventional measures such as these if people's
lives were at stake. He also confirmed that Mauss had tried to arrange
negotiations between the Colombian government and the GLN guerillas.

Racist attacks by Hamburg police
</H1>
Racicist and violent attacks against foreigners have been committed by
police in Hamburg. That is the finding of an official inquiry into the
matter in its final report. However, the inquiry did not find evidence
of a widespread general xenophobic attitude among officers in the city.
The report has been ratified by the parliament with a great majority of
votes. The inquiry had been instated two years ago after there had been
some reports of attacks on foreigners.

</H1>
The General Director of Berlin theatre company "Berliner Ensemble",
Martin Wuttke, has resigned. As a reason he cited the lack of financial
security beyond 1998 for the company, which is closely associated with
the life and work of playwright Bertolt Brecht. Yesterday, the "Berliner
Ensemble" had sacked its successful director Einar Schleef in a surprise
move.
