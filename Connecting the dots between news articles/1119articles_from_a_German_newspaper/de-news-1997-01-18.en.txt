Speculation concerning Tax Reform
</H1>
According to newspaper reports, Federal Minister of Finance Waigel
confirmed that, beginning in 1999, the value added tax is to be
raised by two percent to 17 percent. To be sure, Mr. Waigel does not
want to raise the lowered 7 percent rate which, among other items.
applies to books, transportation and food items.  The Minister wants
to apply the additional revenues to the cost of the major tax reform.
The SPD has again refused the latter since it is incongruent with the
economic situation.

Gregor Gysi Will Not be a Candidate Again
</H1>
The head politician of the PDS does not wish to be in the new party
leadership.  Mr. Gysi has not allowed his name to be placed in
nomination for the evening election of the PDS convention in
Schwerin.  He stated that his being a member of the party leadership
would not be decisive for the policies of the PDS.  The only
important matter was replacing the Kohl government.  The focus of
Saturday's discussion at the convention was mass unemployment.  Among
other measures, the delegates called  for the shortening of work days
with full compensation.
On Friday, the PDS had decided that, in the future, it would give up
its role as a pure opposition party.  In the future, it would plan to
influence the government of states and federation in coalitions as

CDU Opposes Legalization of Hard Drugs
</H1>
The CDU wants to remain tough in drug policies.  The thrust of the
SPD for future legalization of not only hash for private use  but
also of so called hard drugs like heroine or cocaine has encountered
harsh criticism among the Christian Democrats.  Party Secretary
General Hinze told the KOELNER EXPRESS that the CDU would not yield a
millimeter in the matter of drugs.  If the gate were to be opened
even a crack, there would be such flooding with drugs that the gate
could never again be closed, Hinze told the paper.  Experience in
other countries bore out that the legalization of narcotics would
lead to increased consumption, he stated.  In the view of the CDU
politician, therapy must set a life free of drugs as its goal rather
than a life with drugs.  The parliamentary CDU spokesperson for
internal policies within the states, Mr. Zeitelmann, expressed the
view that the SPD was "bereft of its senses" when it made this
proposal.
The deputy head of the police union, Mr. Steffenhagen, expressed his
approval for what he called the "principle of opportunity" in
prosecuting drug dependent persons.  According to Mr. Steffenhagen,
the police would have to be enabled to decide whether to initiate
prosecution on a case by case basis.
