Food producer Thomy under extortion
</H1>
Police have found a tube of mustard containing a lethal dose of cyanide in
a supermarket. According to the Saarland Criminal Police the shop was
closed and all food items removed. An extortionist is trying to get several
million marks from food producer Thomy that is part of the Nestle group.
The perpetrators had threatened earlier to poison products of the company.
According to police the extortion has already been going on for several
months. Police assume that several persons are involved based on the
country-wide action.
Police headquarters in Frankfurt have taken over the coordination of
investigations. They stated that Thomy is prepared to make contact with the
extortionists in the way stipulated by the extortionist. Yesterday, the
company received a letter stating that the next attack would not only
target Thomy products. The letter specified three supermarkets in
Regensburg, Bremen, and Saarbruecken. All three supermarkets were closed
immediately.
Police warned strongly against consuming foods such as mayonnaise, mustard
or ketchup that was bought on or after April 1 in the Regensburg
Konti-Markt, a Saarbruecken Plus-Markt, and a Bremen Lidl-Markt. Concerned
peopled should not open the products but immediately call the police. A
toll-free telephone hot-line has also been established. Its number is

Slight decrease of unemployment in March
</H1>
The number of unemployed has decreased to 4.48 million in March according
to a report by Federal Department of Labour in Nuremberg. That is 190,000
people less than in February. The rate of unemployment for both west and
east Germany is now 11.7%. The decrease of unemployment is seasonal because
many workers especially in the construction industry are laid off during
the winter. These people are now re-hired. The over-all trend, however, is
not positive. There are still 4.5 million people without a job in Germany,
that is 335,000 more than one year ago. The number of employed people also
declined. There are only about 34 million employed in Germany. About
590,000 less than in 1996. This reduction was most intense in manufacturing
and construction.

Employment summit in Berlin
</H1>
Unions, employers, and politicians met in Berlin to discuss the current
situation on the job market. Dieter Schulte, chief of the National
Federation of Unions said that in view of the economic conditions the high
rate of unemployment in Germany was embarrassing. Stimulation of research
and investment was necessary to create new jobs.
President of the employer associations Dieter Hundt said, the German
economy, too, had to take a positive attitude towards the global structural
change. New jobs could only be created through innovations, new markets,
and new products. The politicians had to make sure that the conditions are
right, for example, competitive wages.
Federal Labour Minister Norbert Bluem demanded a change of attitude in the
organization of work hours. Part-time work must be encouraged, this would
also correspond to the demand of many unemployed people.

Baden-Wuerttemberg presents Young Generation Future Offensive programme
</H1>
The state government of Baden-Wuerttemberg has presented the cornerstones
for the Young Generation Future Offensive programme. The government wants
to use the programme to focus investments on areas that are important for
the economic performance, especially science, research, and new
technologies. In real terms, 19 state universities will be expanded and 850
new places at universities will be created. The programme will be financed
by selling state-owned Agency for State Development to state-owned State
Credit Bank. The cabinet approved only yesterday to first sell shares worth
DM566m. There is a controversy whether any profit could be made at all by
selling the remaining shares. Although the state targets returns of
approximately DM1bn, the State Credit Bank has signalled that it is not
prepared to pay that much. It is said that some concerns came even from
within the CDU faction. Thus, there is still need for action. The cabinet
will make final decisions in two weeks' time.
