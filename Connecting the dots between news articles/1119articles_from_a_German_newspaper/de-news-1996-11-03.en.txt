Kohl back in Germany
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl is back after traveling through Asia for one and a half
weeks. His airplane landed last night at the airport Ramstein. The
Chancellor had been scheduled to land at the airport Koeln-Bonn, but 1000
miners were rallying there against the mining policy of the German
government. They wanted to remind Kohl of his promises in regards to
mining, particularly subventions for hard coal mining. CDU Vice Chairman
and State Premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg Teufel had proposed to dramatically
cut mining subsidies. Expenses of almost 10 billion marks per year can not
be justified given the budget problems.

Sager about pressing problems of the Green party
</H1>
Changes in the party structure and a new basic concept are the
most pressing problems for the Green party, according to speaker of the
ecological party Sager. In an interview with the radio station
"Sueddeutscher Rundfunk", the politician said that there are personnel
problems because the party is trying to balance too many principles. The
different wings of the party, realists and fundamentalist, should not
develop into an end in themselves. After the party convention in November,
the politician will concentrate on state issues again.

Synod of the Lutheran church on Borkum
</H1>
The Board of the Evangelical Church in Germany, EKD, has taken
stock seven years after the fall of the Berlin wall. Opening the five day
synod on the North Sea island Borkum, chairman Engelhardt stressed that it
is part of the unity of the church to accept different contexts of life and
church. In the West, people have used their civic liberties with the result
that solidarity and willingness for consensus have diminished. In the GDR,
forced secularization led most people to leave the church.
