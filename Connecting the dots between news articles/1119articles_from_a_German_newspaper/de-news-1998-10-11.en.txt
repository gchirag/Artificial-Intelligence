Guestrow: SPD plans to collaborate with PDS
</H1>
The Social Democrats (SPD) in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
plan to negotiate a collaboration in state government with the Democratic
Socialists (PDS). Mr. Ringsdorff, state chairman of the SPD, said in
Guestrow that this decision of the party board was practically unanimous,
the aim being to attain a stable state government for the next four years.
It is still undecided whether the negotiations will result in a coalition
between the parties or just remain the PDS "tolerating" a SPD government.
Mr. Ringsdorff said that he is of the opinion that it should be possible to
work together with the PDS on important issues in the middleterm, better
than it would be with the CDU. Mrs Merkel, state party chairman of the CDU,
said that this was a bad mistake for the future of the state in the medium
term and that she could not understand how this would to lead to stable
government in Schwerin. Wolfgang Schaeuble, parliamentary leader of the
CDU/CSU, accused the SPD of "finally having lost all their inhibitions."

Germany. State health insurance companies report that absenteeism dropped
last year to an average of 18 days; in the East German states it was only 17
days. Absenteeism was even lower in the first six months of 1998. Health
insurance companies presume that the main reason or this is the precarious

Bonn: fourth round of coalition negotiations
</H1>
The SPD and the Greens have met for the fourth round of coalition
negotiations today in Bonn. Items for discussion concern details
regarding tax cuts and the withdrawal from atomic energy. The state premiers
from states governed by the SPD had previously met with the party executive.
According to the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper, the Social Democrats are
of the opinion that the Greens' plans for withdrawing from atomic energy
cannot be implemented. The source of this information is an assessment
carried out on behalf of the SPD parliamentary group. According to this
assessment, closing nuclear stations prematurely would
be equivalent to dispossessing energy companies. The Greens have called for
all atomic power plants to be shut down, preferably within the next five
years, however without damage to industry.

Schaeuble: The SPD will not be able to keep all election promises
</H1>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, chairman of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group in the
Bundestag, has said that the Schroeder government will not able to keep
their fundamental election promises. Speaking on "Deutschlandfunk" radio, he
said that the Social Democrats and the Greens are trying to convince the
public that there are budget deficits which in reality do not exist. This
was only a method of being able to wriggle out of election promises. Mr.
Schaeuble, who will probably be elected new leader of the CDU, said that the
CDU/CSU intend to be a strong opposition to the government in the
next session of government. They would do their best to ensure that the
process of change and reform in Germany would not come to a standstill.

DGB expects SPD government commitment to vocational training
</H1>
The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) is expecting the government-elect to
commit themselves to technical and vocational training. The DGB has called
on the the SPD and the Greens to create more apprenticeship posts. They said
that it was not enough to fob off the young with substitute programs and
school courses. The position was particularly bad in the former East German
states. The DGB has called for the government-elect to institute the
so-called "Redistribution Law" which would enable funds to be acquired from
businesses who did not engage in vocational training. These funds could then
be used to provide apprenticeship posts with good prospects.
