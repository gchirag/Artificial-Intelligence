Federal government stands by solidarity surcharge
</H1>
The federal government's plan to continue the solidarity surcharge longer
than originally planned has been met with harsh criticism. The Taxpayers
Union has called on the federal government to develop an plan to phase out
the surcharge by increments. According to Mr. Rauch, vice president of the
Taxpayers Union, the unnecessarily high tax burden is putting a choke hold
on citizens and the economy.  This was in reaction to an interview given
by Mr Schwanitz, the Minister for Development of Eastern Germany.  In it,
he said that the solidarity surcharge could not be dispensed with at least
until the year 2004. At that point, he said, the so-called "solidarity
pact" expires which regulates the surcharge. At present, the tax accounts
for 5.5% of wage and income taxes. SPD and Green politicians have pointed
to the present financial situation and affirmed that further support from
these funds will be necessary for a longer period of time for the economic
development of the eastern part of Germany.  Mr. Gerhardt, the head of the
FDP, criticized this statement.  He said the red-green coalition wants to
squeeze taxpayers like a lemon. He added that what those who want to
extend the solidarity surcharge really want is to make it a regular tax.

Riot in Kiel
</H1>
Approximately 1,000 right-wing radicals gathered in Kiel to protest
against an exhibition focusing on war crimes of the German Wehrmacht.
The youth wing of the NPD (National Democratic Party of Germany) organized
the march. The Administrative Court of Schleswig lifted the ban on the
mass meeting.  Around 1,500 police officers were on duty to prevent
violent clashes. Approximately 1,000 citizens held a peaceful
demonstration to protest against the right-wing action. However, some 300
anarchists [Autonomen] attempted to break through police cordons. Several
stones were also hurled.

New child-care leave regulations proposed
</H1>
Instead of having to take child care leave all at once, Ms. Bergmann,
Federal Minister of the Family, would like to make it possible for parents
to take off every third year until the child reaches eight years of age.
In addition, she adds, both parents should be entitled to take child care
leave because both have a right to part time work and child care benefits.

Economic institute supports 3% wage increases
</H1>
According to the German Institute of Economic Research (DIW), wages and
salaries should increase by 3% this year. In the public sector, the DIW
sees a 2.5% rise as appropriate. The calculations were made public by DIW
President Hoffmann in the newspaper "Neuer Osnabrueck". According to Mr.
Hoffmann, with a increase in productivity of 1.5%, and estimated inflation
rate of about the same, if wage negotiations in the commercial sector
ended in a 3% increase, there should be no negative effects on the
economic situation or the labor market; such increases would be "cost and
profit neutral." The DIW president thought a half percent less, i.e. a
wage increase of 2.5%, would be appropriate for the public sector. He
cited the better job security of civil servants and the empty state
coffers as reasons for the difference.

<P>
Both sides in the upcoming collective bargaining rounds are still miles
from these numbers. Major clashes seem preprogrammed in the impending
negotiations with the metal workers union and the public service workers
unions. IG Metall has demanded a wage and salary increase of 6.5% for its
workers while the employers are so far offering 2%.  The DAG (National
Union of Employees) and the OeTV (Union for the Public Service and
Transportation Sector) have demanded an increase of 5.5%.  In this case as
well, employers have similarly brushed off their demands.

Can PDS be excluded from Secret Service oversight committee?
</H1>
Claus, secretary-general of the PDS Bundestag faction, announced today
that the Federal Constitutional Court will determine whether the exclusion
of the PDS from the secret service oversight committee is legal.  The CDU
and SPD would like the PDS to be denied a seat on the supervisory
committee, because the PDS wants Mr. Rupp -- a former spy for the GDR,
alias Topaz -- to be a member of their party faction.
