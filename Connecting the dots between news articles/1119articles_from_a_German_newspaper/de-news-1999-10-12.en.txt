Expert opinion starts new discussion about shop closing hours
</H1>
The economics think-tank IFO-Institut fuer Wirtschaftsforschung has started
a new strong debate of the shopping hour law by recommending to abolish any
opening limits for Monday through Saturday. The long awaited expert report
states that there was no significant economic reason for limiting the tie a
shop may be open.
The trade unions say the consequences from the expert opinion are crystal
clear. Everything must remain as it is because already the changed
regulations introduced three years ago had produced neither more jobs nor a
higher return. This was shown by the studies. Therefore, the economics and
the labour ministry do not want to abolish the shopping hour limits
completely. A law would continue to regulate shopping hours but the scope
has not been determined yet. The decision would be made after a thorough
evaluation of the two expert opinions. However, shops will remain closed on
Sundays and holidays. Even before the publication of the expert reports,
politicians of SPD and CDU had advocated further liberalization of the
shopping hours. Lower-Saxony's Minister of Economics Fischer (SPD) said in
an interview with the daily Die Welt that the shopping hour law was an
anachronism and must be abolished. Schleswig-Holstein's Labour Minister
Moser voiced a similar opinion. The CDU/CSU's economics spokesman Uldal
said there was no way around a liberalization of the shopping hour law.

Eichel rejects asset tax
</H1>
Finance Minister Hans Eichel has rejected his party's plans to introduce an
additional asset tax for the rich. This group had already been targeted by
closing tax loopholes, said a spokesperson of the finance ministry.
Chancellor and SPD secretary-general Gerhard Schroeder avoided a clear
statement regarding the asset tax. He told journalists that plans had not
changed and that the Future Programme would be adopted by the parliament
without a tax hike. When a journalist asked whether this would include an
asset tax, Schroeder did not reply. CDU/CSU called plans for an asset tax
election fraud. The Federation of German Industries called the tax crazy.

High error rates of tax collection by federal states
</H1>

responsible for increasingly higher tax losses. At the presentation of the
1999 annual report Court of Auditors president von Wedel said that local
tax offices had high rates of error in collecting taxes. Furthermore, the
federal budget could be saved millions of marks. For example, estimated 200
million DM were spent on unnecessary road signs along federal highways.
