Federal government will get involved in physicians' billing scandal
</H1>
The federal government will take action regarding the billing scandals
concerning lab physicians and heart specialists. Minister of Health
Seehofer told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper that he would develop
procedures in collaboration with physicians and health insurance companies
in order to make manipulations more difficult. This also includes budget
checks. Seehofer stated that it was not possible simply to return to daily
routine, given the current increase in the number of investigations and
trials concerning billing violations. He said that he continued to believe
that the majority of physicians is acting correctly.

IG Metall union enters election campaign with a campaign for work
</H1>
IG Metall union leader Zwickel continues to assume an increase in the
unemployment rate during the winter to 5 million. Zwickel said in an
interview with Leipziger Volkszeitung that he had appealed to the coalition
several months ago to change its course. In light of this, he also
criticized the employers and added that they had not contributed anything
toward a solution of this crisis except for empty promises. At the same
time he announced that the unions would enter the Bundestag election
campaign with a campaign for work and social justice. Zwickel stressed that
it was time for Germany to have a government which would advance
innovations, promote investments, and create new jobs.

Insufficient number of referendum votes in Schleswig-Holstein
</H1>
The Day of Prayer and Repentance will remain a work day in Holstein. In
yesterday's referendum, only 20% of more than 2 million registered voters
were in favor of re-introducing the Day of Prayer and Repentance as a legal
holiday. At least 25% would have been necessary in order for the referendum
to be successful. The initiative for a referendum originated with the
Protestant Church. The CDU faction of the State Parliament in Kiel now
wants to become actively involved in this issue.

<P>
Like all other states except Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein had abolished the
holiday in order to finance the employers' contributions to nursing-care
insurance.

Gradual removal of border checkpoints at the borders to Austria
</H1>
Beginning today, those traveling from Germany to Austria may be able to
pass the border without having to show their passport. Austria is a member
of the so-called Agreement of Schengen which facilitates border traffic
between EU member countries. However, traffic at Austrian and German border
checkpoints is not completely without stops yet. Checks are gradually
decreased, which will take the longest for the busier border stations. The
Schengen era did start today at smaller crossing points to Bavaria and
Baden-Wuerttemberg. This does not mean that there are no controls at all.
Passports are still required documents for travelling citizens of the
European Union, although they are not asked to show them at the border.
With the help of so-called "undercover investigations" and "right to
pursuit across jurisdiction boundaries", there will be spot-checks beyond
the border, mainly to fight organised crime. The police is also allowed to
operate across the border into the neighboring country.

Education & Science Union demands alliance for education 
</H1>
At the beginning of a week of student demonstrations, the Education &
Science union (GEW) demanded an alliance for education and science. The
union also demanded spaces for at least 100,000 new students over the next
three years and the hiring of an additional 10,000 teaching assistants and
tutors. The union called on federal and state governments to improve
university facilities; otherwise it would soon no longer be possible to
offer high-quality university education in Germany. The GEW considers the
draft for a new federal law on university education nothing but a legal
tug-of-war between federal and state governments. The chairpersons of CDU
and CSU in federal and state governments defended the university reform. A
white paper, written together with Minister of Education Ruettgers, states
that only the new law could effectively fight the tension-laden situation
at German universities.

<P>
The number of universities on strike has increased to 60. Strikes are
carried on at all West German universities except for Bremen.

Prison sentences for HP employees after stealing circuit boards
</H1>
The State court issued several prison sentences in the trial involving the
theft of memory cards at the computer manufacturer Hewlett Packard. The 5
defendants stole more DM 50 milliom from the company. The mastermind behind
this theft, who was responsible for the organisation and distribution of
the stolen goods, received a 5 1/2-year sentence, and the recipient of the
stolen goods, who had written the invoices, received a 2 1/2-year prison
sentence. The presiding judge referred to the punishment as relatively
mild, saying that the defendants' confessions had had a positive effect.
Without them, it would have taken much longer to solve one of the biggest
employee thefts in Germany. Yet another positive effect had been the
attempt to compensate for the damage. The presiding judge acknowledged that
Hewlett Packard was partially to be blamed since the thieves could never
have carried off the stolen goods in backpacks if better surveillance had
been in place.

Kirch insists on contract on marketing of the Soccer World Cup
</H1>
According to the Munich media giant Leo Kirch, the international soccer
federation, FIFA, will not be able to cancel the contract on marketing the
soccer world cups in 2002 and 2006 on television. In the Frankfurter
Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Kirch's chief executive officer Hahn rejected
the threat made by FIFA's General Secretary, Blatter, that the federation 
would carry through the free live broadcast for everyone, if necessary by
canceling the contract. Hahn stated that a fully valid license agreement
did exist. Neither the rights stemming from this license nor the agreed
upon purchase price of DM 3.4 billion could be generalized. Blatter, on the
other hand, only mentioned a basic contract with Kirch.
