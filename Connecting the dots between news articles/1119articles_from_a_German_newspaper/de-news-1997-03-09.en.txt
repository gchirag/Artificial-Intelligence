CDU/CSU aggrieved at SPD cancelling further tax reform talks
</H1>
The CDU/CSU are aggrieved that the Social Democrats have cancelled
further tax reform talks. Wolfgang Schaeuble, the parliamentary leader of
the CDU/CSU accused Oskar Lafontaine, the national leader of the SPD, in
the Sunday newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" of playing a dangerous game by
combining the issues of tax reform and coal-mining subsidies. Mr Schaeuble
said that Mr Lafontaine was only thinking of party politics and that he
was apparently indifferent to Germany's destiny.

Demonstration against cutting coal subsidies
</H1>
Thousands of miners have held a protest at the Goetelborn
Mine in the Saarland against Bonn's plans to cut coal subsidies. The miners

from 10 billion marks to around 3.8 billion marks by the year 2005.
The occupation of all German mines and road blockades are continuing.
The motorways between Saarlouis and Saarbruecken at Voelklingen and the
national road between Saarbruecken and Trier have been blocked. The Union
for Mining and Energy have announced a mass demonstration for tomorrow

SPD have set conditions for continued tax-reform talks
</H1>
The Social Democrats (SPD) have set certain conditions to the
German government for continuing the tax-reform talks. The national
leader of the SPD, Oskar Lafontaine, said in a newspaper interview that
further talks would only make sense if the government were to
significantly lower social-security contributions and provide relief for
employees and families by January 1998. Mr Lafontaine demanded that the
coalition withdraw their irresponsible cuts (as he put it) to the
coal-mining subsidies.

DGB wants compulsory visa requirement for foreign children to be revoked
</H1>
The German Federation of Trade Unions (DGB) has appealed to
the German parliament to revoke the controversial ruling requiring
foreign children in Germany to posses a visa. The Bundesrat (the upper
house of parliament) will be discussing the matter at their sitting this
coming Friday. The DGB reports that around 2000 children travelled to
Germany without being accompanied by an adult within the last year. Only
352 of these cases could not be cleared up. Most of the time these were
children who were visiting relatives during the school holidays. The
Federal Minister for the Interior, Manfred Kanther, had referred to
misuse of the situation by asylum seekers when he issued the ruling.

Bernstedt: Spelling reform must be implemented
</H1>
Mr Bernstedt, the chairman of the Conference of Culture/Cultural
Issues and the Minister of Cultural Issues for Lower Saxony has warned
against not implementing the spelling reform. He said in a newspaper
interview that Germany would make themselves into a laughing stock.
A rift between the German states could result if the opponents of the
spelling reform were successful in their petition for a referendum. The
Social Democrat said that differing spelling rules within the
German-speaking areas was not acceptable while renewing his defence
for the simplification of spelling for future generations.

Demand for stricter alcohol limits for drivers
</H1>
The German insurance industry has called for stricter alcohol
limits for motorists. Mr Gas, a member of the board of directors said to
the Sunday newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that around 10 percent of
insurance claims were due to alcohol-related accidents and that the
alcohol limit for drivers should thus be lowered to an alcohol blood
level of 50 millilitres. Furthermore, beginner drivers should adhere to
a blood alcohol limit of between 20 to 30 millilitres within the first
two or three years of driving. This would enable the starting automobile
insurance rate of 240 percent (of the standard rate) for this group to be
lowered, providing that younger drivers drove more reasonably when sober.
