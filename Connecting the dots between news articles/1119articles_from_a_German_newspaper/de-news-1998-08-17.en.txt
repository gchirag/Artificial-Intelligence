Russian financial crisis jeopardizes German export business
</H1>
Economic experts in the west fear the Russian financial crisis to also
affect neighbouring countries. The weak rubel would put pressure on
currencies of countries of the former Sovjet States. Some experts said that
such a spiral of crises could jeopardize even the Chinese currency which is
already suffering due to the Asia-crisis.
Chief economist of the West German "Landesbank", Mr. Hombrecher, points to
the fact that, after the Asia-crisis, another rising market declines. He
said in the newspaper "Westdeutsche Allgemeinen Zeitung" that there are
also dangers to the German export trade business.

Bubis: situation in Germany not comparable to Switzerland
</H1>
In the course of the discussion about compensation payments for victims of
the Holocaust, chairman of the German Jewish Committee, Ignaz Bubis,
declared himself against economic pressure on German companies. Moreover,
Bubis said in the Deutschlandfunk Radio, the situation in Germany would not
be comparable to the situation in Switzerland. Immediatley after the war,
Germany had implemented laws for compensation payments for the victims.
Banks and industry, however, would still have reasons to agree on
compensations. After the agreement between Swiss banks and Jewish
organisations, he reckons with faster talks with German companies.

Schwanitz for simplification of regulations for support of East Germany
</H1>
The SPD-representative for the economic building-up of the East, Schwanitz,
declared himself in favour of changing the regulations for financial
support. In the case of a victory of his party in the federal elections his
party will  substantially simplify the distribution of money in the new
States,  he said in the "Deutschlandradio Berlin".  He called the situation
a "real financial support jungle in East Germany". Because of confusing
regulations, mainly small and middle-sized businesses would stand no
chances. Schwanitz supports the combination of different programs and the
creation of more transparent conditions.

Incidents on Hess' day of death involving right extremists
</H1>
Apparently, the 11th day of death of Hitler's representative rudolf Hess
was cause of numerous fights of right extremists. Two policemen were
seriously injured by xenophobe youths in Fuerstenwalde/Brandenburg. The
policemen were called because the youths previously had verbally attacked a
Cuban couple. A car of a dark-skinned Frenchman and his femal friend was
stopped by several men in Berlin. The right extremists kicked the couple
and attacked them with teargas. Further incidents occurred in Berlitz near
Potsdam where right extremists showed posters of Hess with the illegal
Nazi-symbol.
