Family-planning to become independent from catholic church
</H1>
The leading organisation of catholics in Germany (ZDK) proposed to
reorganise the 260 family planning units, virtually re-opening them as
independent associations; this would take them out of the bishops'
responsibilities. The reason for this strategy was an anticipated
recommendation by the Holy See to stop issuing certificates confirming to
a pregnant woman that she actually been 'counselled' (required by law before
an abortion can go ahead).

Number of persons with AIDS drops markedly
</H1>
Last year the number of people suffering from AIDS dropped
markedly. According to the Robert-Koch Institute there were approximately
1,000 new cases, compared to 1,500 the year before. The Institute thought
that this was due to new drugs delaying the outbreak of AIDS. The number of
new infections with HIV, however, remained at the same level, viz. 2,000
to 2,500 per year.

The never-ending battle about spelling-reforms
</H1>
The battle of the spelling-reforms continued, as experts meeting in Mannheim
were against a compromise allowing many current rules to stay when the new
rules applied. Representatives of publishers and associations declared that
this would endanger the uniformness of spelling, proposing to stick with the
1996 reform-draft instead. According to the publishers of the Duden, the
1996 draft had some weaknesses but should be acceptable to all. The
teachers' union, the association for the German language and the association
of German authors disagreed: they were for keeping old and new versions.
The main bone of contention was when to use upper- and when lower-case,
and how to hyphenate words.

Big business criticises state finance ministers
</H1>
Big business criticised the state finance ministers' decision to
accept tax-returns in Euro (the future common European currency) only as of
2002, claiming that Germany would lead the tail-end in this respect.
Especially small- and medium-sized businesses would get hurt by having to
do their accounting in two currencies (doubling up on double-entry
bookkeeping).

Public prosecutor against keeping Mr Schneider in minimum-security jail
</H1>
Mr Schneider, high-flyer/crasher to the tune of billions of marks, will have
to do time in jail - without the perks. The state prosecutor said that living
outside the prison (and coming back at night) would only be acceptable to the
law if a defendant had not previously been remanded, which did not apply
in Mr Schneider's case. And there still was unfinished business as far
as his bankruptcy was concerned.
