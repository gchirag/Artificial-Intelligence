Mr Kanther against working less hours in public sector
</H1>
Minister for Internal Affairs Kanther is against generally cutting the
number of hours worked in the public sector. He said in Bonn that this
would be totally wrong, leading way back to the past, reacting to a union
request for the upcoming award-talks. Local body employers also were reluctant
about the matter, and as a spokes-person stated, they were all for more
employment, but would have to stress that there would be less in the kitty
to pay for their staff. Award-talks for some 3 millions staff working in the
public sector (federal, state and local) will start on 7 October.
