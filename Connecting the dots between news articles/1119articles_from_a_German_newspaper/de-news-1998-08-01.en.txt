Smuggling of illegal aliens is on the rise
</H1>
The number of foreigners smuggled into Germany has dramatically increased.
This is according to the Federal Minister of the Interior, Mr. Kanther, in
an interview with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag." In the first half of
1998, almost twice as many foreigners crossed the borders into Germany
illegally as in the previous year. The number of cases where they were
discovered by authorities climbed from 64 to 97. The main border illegal
aliens are being smuggled across is the one between Germany and the Czech
Republic. Mr. Hadrat, the Minister of the Interior of Saxony, is demanding
more effective cooperation with the Polish and Czech authorities. The 46
Afghanis who were taken into custody yesterday in Wuerzburg were sent back
to the Czech Republic.

tellers are not working, and cable television and radio stations are
broadcasting only test patterns. The police and fire departments have set
