Extensive stop to deportation of Kosovo Albanians
</H1>
Most of the federal states do not want to deport Albanians from the
troubled Serbian province of Kosovo. Especially the SPD-ruled states want
to wait and see how the situation develops in Kosovo. They went along with
the decision of North-Rhine Westphalia and Lower Saxony to defer
deportations until the end of this week. Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg
stressed, however, that they intended to continue with deportation on a
case-by-case basis, without directly returning people to Kosovo. The
Federal Interior Minister, Kanther, also spoke against a general stop to
deportation, saying that the situation in Kosovo was difficult, but that he
had no information to suggest that people who had been refused asylum had
been subjected to human rights abuse in Yugoslavia.

The controversial swearing in ceremony of Federal Army recruits in front of
the Berlin City Hall, which was originally planned for 13 August, has been
brought forward to 10 June. The change was agreed by Federal Defence
Minister Ruehe and the city mayor, Diepgen. There was strong criticism from
the SPD, the Greens and the PDS of the planned public taking of vows of
recruits being held on 13 August, the anniversary of the building of the
Berlin Wall in 1961.

"Genetic fingerprinting" of sex offenders?
</H1>
In future, sex offenders may have the genetic data of their saliva, sperm
or hair logged in a central database, according to the Federal Interior
Ministry. Re-offenders could then be identified more swiftly with the help
of these genetic fingerprints. Federal Interior Minister, Manfred Kanther,
and Federal Justice Minister Schmidt-Jortzig have agreed on a corresponding
draft law. The data would be held for up to 20 years.

Turkish Foreign Minister cancels visit to Germany
</H1>
The strained relationship between Germany and Turkey has worsened further.
The Turkish Foreign Minster Cagar (Sp?) called off his planned visit to
Germany today. The reason given was that the long-planned meeting with
Federal Labour Minister Bluem had been reduced at the last minute to a
lunch. It would not therefore be worth it for Cagar to travel to Germany.
The Labour Ministry in Bonn rejected the complaint: it had been mutually
agreed that an intensive discussion would follow the lunch. German-Turkish
relations had already been strained following Nazi accusations made by the
Turkish Minister President Yilmaz last week.

Girls at disadvantage when looking for training jobs
</H1>
The German Federation of Union (DGB) has criticized that young women are
disfavoured when looking for trainee jobs. Mr. Goerner, member of the DGB
executive said girls were more strongly affected by the reduction of
trainee jobs than boys. More than half of those who were still looking for
a trainee job in January were female although only 49% of all applicants
were women. Goerner assumes that the situation will become more serious
because this year was the first time that more girls than boys were looking
for a trainee job.

Partial victory for Germany in "banana dispute"
</H1>
Germany has achieved an important victory in the European Supreme Court
regarding the European "banana dispute". The court nullified the EU's
approval of a basic treaty with four Central American countries that export
bananas. The treaty had put the traditional exporters and thus most of the
German importers at a disadvantage. The import of Latin American bananas
had been limited and a duty was imposed to promote the sale of bananas from
Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean.

Tax frauds arrested in Stuttgart
</H1>
Police and customs have apprehended five persons in the Stuttgart/
Ludwigsburg area who allegedly tricked 1.35 million DM from the tax office.
The state criminal police arrested two men and one woman. All five
confessed most allegations. Apparently, the group of five had registered
several companies with the trade office since July last year. These
companies issued each other fake bills. The head of the group then applied
for and received a tax return. Money was transferred several times among
various accounts as a cover-up. Several banks suspected money laundering
and contacted the police.
