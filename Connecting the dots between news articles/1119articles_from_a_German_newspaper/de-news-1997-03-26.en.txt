Kinkel meets Turkish Foreign Minister Ciller in Ankara
</H1>
German Foreign Minister Kinkel and his Turkish counterpart,
Ciller, have affirmed their differing attitudes to the question of a
possible Turkish membership in the European Union. After meeting with
Kinkel in Ankara, Ciller said that her country had to be judged by the
same criteria as other applicants, otherwise it would be a case of
discrimination. At the same time, she made it clear that Turkey was not
trying to gain acceptance already within the next year or two. Following
the meeting, Kinkel made reference to problem areas in the relationship
between Turkey and the EU. He emphasized the issue of human rights. He
indicated that until solutions were found in that area, Turkish membership
in the EU would not be possible.

Founding of "Thyssen-Krupp Steel" decided
</H1>
The creation of a joint steel company between
Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch is practically signed and sealed. The executive
chairmen of the two companies, Vogel and Cromme, signed a declaration of
intention to that effect last night. Under the agreement, Thyssen will
have a 60 percent, Krupp a 40 percent share of the new company, which is
to be called "Thyssen-Krupp-Stahl". Both companies want a brief period to
discuss the solution with their factory committees and the union.
The fusion of the two companies is also supposed to result in 8,000 fewer
jobs by the year 2002, with no operations-related lay-offs, however.
According to Thyssen boss, Schulz, the reduction will affect all
facilities except the production plant in Duisburg. The executives of both
companies said that the cuts will be made in a socially responsible
manner; they are planning on not refilling position which become vacant.

No agreement over schedules for older workers at VW
</H1>
The second round of contract negotiations to settle the question
of part-time work for older employees at Volkswagen has ended without
success. One issue of contention between representatives of the auto
manufacturer and the union IG Metall is the union's demand for a balance
(of working and non-working times) that will minimize the loss of pension
benefits for employees. Also, the chief negotiator for VW, Schumm (sp?),
wants to include that matter in a large package deal which would also
cover wages and supplements, as well as questions of job security and
flexibility in work times. The two sides will meet again in the middle of
next month.

</H1>

disposal of radioactive waste. The boss of RWE, Farnung (sp?), wrote to
Federal Environment Minister Merkel that a paper negotiated between
Government and Opposition experts about the energy sector did provide a

in the news magazine "Wirtschaftswoche", however, which stated that energy
companies were prepared to finance new storage facilities for radioactive
waste.

Daimler-Benz earns profits in the billions
</H1>
The Daimler-Benz company earned billions of Marks in 1996.
According to an obligatory report, the company's net profit stands at 2.8
billion Marks. In 1995, a loss of 5.7 billion Marks was revealed. A direct
comparison of the two results is supposed to be difficult, however, owing
to special circumstances in effect in 1995. It is expected that a dividend
of DM 1.10 per share will be suggested at the company's general meeting at
the end of May.

Tax estimates: 15 billion Marks less than anticipated?
</H1>
The World Economic Institute figures that the tax estimates in May
will find 15 billion Marks less that has been assumed. An employee at the
Kiel-based institute told the Berliner Zeitung newspaper that the
shortfall means it is increasingly unlikely that Germany will fulfill the
deficit criteria of the Maastricht Treaty. He said the federal deficit
would be closer to 3.3 percent of gross national product than to the 3
percent prescribed by the Treaty.
The newspaper report adds that the Munich-based ifo Institute expects a
shortfall of at least 10 billion Marks, and the Economic Research
Institute in Berlin foresees a gap of 5 billion Marks.
Experts blame increasing unemployment as the primary factor.
