"Political Ash Wednesday" in Bavaria marked by trading insults
</H1>
In the face of approaching state and federal elections, the parties today
observed the traditional Political Ash Wednesday in Lower Bavaria. The CSU
held its rally in the Niebelungenhalle centre in Passau, where leader Theo
Waigel fired off a personal attack on Joschka Fischer of the Greens. The
Greens held their assembly next door, on Passau's Exerzierplatz. Fischer:
"How can we allow this situation to continue?  After sixteen years of
Helmut Kohl, the greatest risk of poverty Germans face lies in having
children." The SPD, in Vilshofen, heard Oskar Lafontaine say: "It was
really very amusing to learn that East Asian countries are experiencing a
great financial crisis, and who do they send in as a consultant, to douse
the fire? Theo Waigel. I have to ask myself what he actually did there.
Maybe he consoled them, saying not to take it so hard, that it's the same
over here, or maybe he told the president to follow Helmut's example 
he's not bothered by unemployment or national debt, he just stands there
and says he's doing okay, he still has his job".

SPD to announce chancellery candidate following Lower Saxony elections
</H1>
The SPD now plans to announce its candidate for chancellor the day after
the state election in Lower Saxony. A special meeting of the party
executive will be held on Monday for that purpose. Gerhardt Schroeder said
in a newspaper interview that the silence over the SPD candidate for the
leadership of the country would be broken 1 1/2 hours after the closing of
Lower Saxony voting stations. As recently as a few days ago, the plan was
to await the outcome of that election, to thoroughly analyze the results,
and only to decide on a candidate in mid-March. However, there has been
pressure within the party against delaying. Originally, party leader
Lafontaine wanted to await the outcome of the Saarland election as well,
but this in no longer certain either.

council this evening in Frankfurt, several delegates called for the
establishment of a search committee, saying that the nomination of Landtag

Hustedt suggests alliance for environmental policy
</H1>
The environmental spokesman for the Greens, Hustedt, has suggested a
strategic alliance between her party and the private sector, with the goal
of jointly developing a set of modern environmental policies. Hustedt told
the Sueddetusche Zeitung newspaper that some of the founding notions of
the environmental movement had been superseded. She added that the Greens
should try to mobilize businesses in the farming and chemical industries,
as well as in the trades, which would be willing to cooperate in a change
of direction vis-a-vis the environment. Hustedt emphasized that the free
market should be the primary means of realizing environmental goals. She
also announced that she would present her idea for discussion at a Green
Party Convention in Bonn tomorrow.

Bishop Spital rejects Meissner's reproach of moral bankruptcy
</H1>
The Bishop of Trier, Spital, has rejected the view of Bishop Meissner of
Cologne that Germans have sunk to a moral all-time low. Spital told the
Koelner Stadtanzeiger newspaper that values had indeed changed, but that
one should not judge them without any differentiation. He also disputed
Meissner's assertion that the media was to blame for the moral decline;
according to Spital, media reporting strengthens existing tendencies, but
does not create them.
<p>
Meissner had repeatedly castigated Germans as being morally bankrupt,
addressing sexual mores in particular.

Eco-Institute: toxic waste dumped down abandoned mines
</H1>
According to information from the Freiburg Eco-Institute, large amounts of
toxic waste are being dumped into abandoned mines in Germany. The
organization claims that in 1994 approximately 12,000 truckloads
disappeared down mineshafts. While municipalities charge DM 450-900 per
tonne for disposal at special hazardous waste sites or in special
incinerators, unloading it underground costs only DM 100-300. Apparently,
shredded plastic waste carrying the "gruener Punkt" ('recyclable') symbol,
filter dust from waste incinerators, as well as processing by-products
containing lead and zinc have been found in the tunnels of the 30
closed-down mines throughout the country. The Eco-Institute has called on
state and federal governments to put a stop to what it calls garbage
anarchy, saying that allowing it today creates a burden for tomorrow.
