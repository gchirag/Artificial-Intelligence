Close of Social-Democrat's Federal Party Conference
</H1>
At the close of the Social-Democrat's (SPD) federal party
conference a large majority of the delegates passed State Premier
Gerhard Schroeder's program on economic policy. 
<P>

Schroeder demands less
governmental regulation, more support for young entrepreneurs, promotion
of medium-sized firms and of the white-collar sector. Schroeder said,
the Social Democrats do have the right ideas, yet keep discussing them
for too long. The party's youth organisation Jusos (Young Socialists)
regard the program as too vague. Juso chairwoman Andrea Nahles called on
Schroeder to clearly indicate how many jobs can be created with this new
program.

Reactions on SPD party conference
</H1>
Governing coalition and employers heavily criticized the Social
Democrat's new economic policy. The Christian Democrat's parliamentary
party leader said the Social Democrats would revive antiquated clichis.
Federal party secretary-general Guido Westerwelle called the SPD an old aunt
who relies solely on the state. President of the employers' association
Hundt felt sorry that Schroeder's paper, which was correct to a
considerable degree, had been watered down at the party conference in
Hannover. The Council of German Chambers of Commerce considered
Schroeder's paper as an agreeable turning away from class struggle
slogans.

100,000 students protesting
</H1>
100,000 students are protesting all over Germany against the
present education policy and tuition fees. In Mainz about 7,000 students
marched to the Ministry of Education. Minister of Education and Science
Zoellner said the state's efforts could not be increased any more -
students in turn reproached him for being hypocritical. Demonstrations
also in other state capitals: in Wiesbaden, Berlin, Hannover,
Saarbruecken and Kiel, but also in Bonn, Karlsruhe, Freiburg and
Tuebingen. The largest rally took place in Duesseldorf. 40,000 students
came from all over North Rhine-Westphalia. Banners said "Seminarleiter
statt Eurofighter" (lecturers instead of Eurofighter). In the meantime
it became known that the states want to agree on the issue of federal
education/training assistance (BAfoeG): the heads of the State Premier's
Offices and Ministers of Finance want to search for a cost-neutral
reform. The model proposed by the Ministers of Education and Science --
the uniform education assistance, is off the table.

London conference ended. About 40 countries discussed about how to
improve compensation for victims.
<P>
US deputy secretary of state Steward
Eisenstead called on the involved countries to contribute to the
international aid fund. On Tuesday the United States and the UK
established this fund, by now only six countries declared to contribute.
The remaining 5 and a half tons gold from the former Nazi stock shall be
quickly distributed through the trilateral Gold Commission.
Representatives of the Jewish World Congress were disappointed by the
outcome of the three-days conference. The Vatican would have kept silent
about the gold worth DM three million, which used to belong to 28,000
Gypsies. Those Gypsies had been killed in Croatia by the fascist
Ustascha regime.
