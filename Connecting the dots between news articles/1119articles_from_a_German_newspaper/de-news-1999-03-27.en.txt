NATO expanded their air strikes on Yugoslavian targets tonight.
NATO Secretary General Solana ordered the beginning of the second phase of

attacking armored tanks and ground forces in Kosovo. Numerous fighter
planes took off again from the Northern Italian NATO base in Aviano
tonight. In addition, an AVACS plane took off to monitor the radar. The
Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs Dini stated that the military action
could last all night.

There were many protests against the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia
in numerous cities throughout Germany today. In Berlin, several thousand
people followed the PDS's call to demonstrate against the attacks. [The

Approximately 3,000 Yugoslavians who are loyal to the government took to
the streets in Stuttgart; approximately 1,000 protested in Nuremberg.
Protests were reported in many other European countries; the largest

against the NATO attacks. Students in Milan chanted anti-war slogans like
