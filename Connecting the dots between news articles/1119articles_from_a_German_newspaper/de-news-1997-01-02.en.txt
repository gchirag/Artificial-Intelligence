Gerhardt: No alternative to governing coalition of Bonn
</H1>
 FDP chairman Gerhardt said there is no alternative to the governing
coalition.  However, this year as well there will be disputes with CDU and
CSU on policy issues.  A grand tax reform with the brakes applied won't
happen with the FDP, Gerhardt commented on the list of New Year's resolutions
for 1997.  Otherwise, positive effects on the economy would fail to
materialize, the party leader emphasized.  He is confident to expect a cap of
income tax in the vicinity of 35%.  Gerhardt said the abolition of the
solidarity tax by the turn of the century continues to be a goal of the FDP,
but he didn't want to make a definite statement as to the exact year.
Choosing five campaign topics in 1997, the party wants to take a head start
in the 1998 federal parliamentary elections.  Selected points are tax and
pension reforms, education reform, the timely enactment of EU economic and
monetary union, as well as an emphasis on interior and judicial policy.
Along these lines, the FDP opposes video surveillance as part of the Grand
Wiretapping Bill.  [A bill proposed to legalize wiretapping without the
knowledge of any of the parties being listened to.]

Stihl demands reduction of employment costs
</H1>
 The president of the German Trade Convention, Mr. Stihl, has repeated
his call for a reduction of employment costs.  This continues to be a
paramount task in 1997, in order to stimulate new investments and thus create
new jobs, Stihl said.  This is why the controversial topic of sick pay
remains on the agenda.  Moreover, Stihl demanded to completely remove the tax
on corporate capital.  In his view, the projected tax reform should yield an
alleviation of DM 30 billions worth of taxes.

Government to step up measures against illegal immigration
</H1>
 The Federal Government wants to step up measures against criminal
organizations transporting illegal immigrants to Germany.  Minister Kanther
of the Interior announced in an interview that henceforth 1,500 additional
border guards will be commissioned to the border with the Czech Republic and
Poland.  He justified this move with the fact that more and more foreigners
are being brought across the border illegally with the aid of a network of
criminal border-crossing organizations.  According to estimates of the
Interior Ministry, about 7,000 people have entered Germany illegally, most of
them via the eastern borders.  The union of the police has already reproved
these plans as hurried, for they do not take into account the future
membership of Poland and the Czech Republic in the European Union.
Nevertheless, definite reassignments for the border guards are expected this
year.

Economics experts agree
</H1>
Almost all of the big economics research institutes expect growth of 2.5% for
1997.  Only the union-friendly Economics and Social Science Institute
anticipates an increase in GNP of 2%.  The majority of the institutes
prognosticate stronger growth in West Germany than in East Germany.  The
researchers agree that particularly export orders will stimulate the German
economy.  However, there will be almost no benefit for the job market, the
Institute of German Economy reported in a summary.  The number of jobless
people is presumed to increase above the 4 million mark.

Prices for vegetables are increasing
</H1>
Many merchants noted price increases of up to 40% for fruits and vegetables,
because winter vegetables froze on the fields in numerous parts of the
country.  According to estimates, up to two-thirds of the harvest was lost
due to the severe cold.  The producers were able to offset most of their
losses through higher prices.  The low temperatures even at the beginning of
1996 still show an effect:  Averaged over the entire year, the consumption of
heating oil and natural gas has risen drastically, by about 10%, according to
ESSO AG.

risen to 226 grams per day.  For the period of a year this amounts to 1,500

23 died due to severe cold
</H1>
Throughout Europe, icy weather has claimed more than 140 lives.  In Germany
alone, the number of victims has climbed to 23.  In particular people in
eastern Europe suffer from temperatures of up to minus 30 degrees Celsius,
for many places lack heating and the availability of medical services is
poor.  In Germany the cold weather has significantly driven up energy
consumption.  On the island of Juist in the North Sea, about 3,500 tourists
are cut off, enclosed by ice, because the ferry service had to be
discontinued.  The people can leave the island only by air.  For the weekend,
the meteorologists predict temporarily milder temperatures, but then it is
expected to become even colder than in the past days.  The continuing cold
weather creates problems for ship traffic on inland waterways.  On the Neckar
river, icebreakers are in operation, on the Mosel and Saar rivers ship
traffic had to be suspended.  Thereby, most German waterways are
inaccessible, only the Rhine is clear again.  On the Danube, piling-up ice
floes triggered flooding in the district of Kehlheim in Lower Bavaria.

Stock market
</H1>
The launch into the new year was marked by bad luck.  The German stock
markets left the first day of trading in 1997 with a decrease of 1.4% in the
DAX.  Officially, the index went down by 40 points to 2849, after trading it
eroded another 28 counts.  IBIS-DAX at closing: 2821.  The main losers were
chemistry stocks which had come under pressure due to the low Dollar.
Hoechst had sagged DM 2.62 by midday, and became another 36 Pfennings cheaper
after trading.  Decreases for BASF and Bayer as well.  Karstadt was among the
few winners.  The bonds increased eleven points to 5.25%.  The Bund-Future,
after a downward race, stopped at a weak 99.48%.  The stock brokers, who
didn't appear in great number for the beginning of the year, are under the
influence of Wallstreet where unexpectedly positive economic figures had a
significant effect on the Dow-Jones.  At 18:30, Dow- Jones had lost 48 points
or 0.7%, down to 6400.  30-year US treasury bonds increased to 6.47%.
Tonight, the US Dollar was at 1.5408 DM.
