Solana's visit in Bonn
</H1>
NATO Secretary General Solana is meeting with Chancellor Schroeder
in Bonn for an exchange of views. One of the topics deals with the
crisis in Kosovo. Solana threatened the parties to the conflict again
with military actions. If Serbs and Kosovo-Albanians would not meet
for negotiations, Nato would intervene. Chancellor Schroeder assured
Solana total support. Later on, Solana talked with Minister of Defense
Scharping and Foreign Minister Fischer. Germany had agreed to participate in a military action on the Balkan, if necessary, in order to
force peace negotiations. NATO confirmed again its willingness for an
intervention in front of the Balkan contact group, to which the Federal

Number of AIDS infected persons in Germany reaches highest
</H1>
At the end of December, 37,000 persons in Germany were HIV positive.
According to figures from the Robert Koch Institute, this number has
never been this high since the discovery of the virus. Every year,
approximately 2000 persons are infected with the virus in Germany.
In the same time period, the number of persons contracting AIDS went
down. The researchers reported that 800 persons contracted AIDS last
year, while 800 persons died from AIDS. These numbers are the lowest
over the last ten years. The higher number of infections, yet lower
number of contractions appears to be the result of new treatment
methods. Since therapies exist which use a combination of treatment
substances, doctors are able to further delay the outbreak of the
disease.
