state premiers Gerhard Schroeder and Oskar Lafontaine, who is also the

Lafontaine presents SPD election campaign program
</H1>
The SPD wants the coalition to prohibit college tuition, party leader
Lafontaine said during the presentation of the SPD election campaign
program. The SPD will block the university collective law if the coalition
fails to come to terms to prohibit tuition explicitly.
<p>
Gerhard Schroeder sticks to the provision to go to Bonn only as federal
chancellor, not in any other position. Party leader Lafontained announced
that immediately after taking over the government in Bonn, the party would
examine the coalition's books and that he expected to make unpleasant
discoveries. Only then could the financial abilities of an SPD government
be assessed. At the same time he warned the possible coalition partner
Alliance/Greens (Buendnis-Gruene) against overly radical plans. Right now,
Lafontaine sees no way for an ecology tax because of economic reasons.

SPD calls on coalition to begin unemployment talks
</H1>
Oskar Lafontaine, Gerhard Schroeder and parliamentary party leader Rudolf
Scharping called on the federal government to begin new talks to fight mass
unemployment. According to Lafontaine, with his party at the top it would
become possible to decrease tax rates and cost of fringe benefits at once.

as sanctimonious.

Diestel acquitted of disloyalty charge
</H1>
The regional court Berlin acquitted the last GDR-Minister of Interior,
Diestel, of the charge of disloyalty. Diestel was standing trial for having
bought a mansion from his own ministry at a price far below the property's
actual value. In the verdict reasoning the presiding judge explained that
Diestel had made a very good deal at that time, but that he also had
violated his duty of loyalty to his ministry. Nevertheless, this was no
disloyalty in the sense of criminal law, because he did not act with malice
aforethought. In 1990 Diestel, then the GDR's last minister of the
interior, had paid only 193,000 DEM for the former visitors' lodgings of
his ministry. Just before reunification, the value of the house had
increased considerably.
<p>
In the meantime, the federal high court has cancelled the purchase
contract. The regional court also acquitted two former co-workers and one
expert. The public prosecutor's office had applied for a period of
probation and a fine for all defendants.

Bank merger in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
The long-planned bank merger in Baden-Wuerttemberg has become reality. This
was announced by state premier Teufel. On January 1, 1999 the state-owned
L-Bank, the Suedwest LB, the top institute of the south-western savings
banks, and the Landesgirokasse (Stuttgart) will form the new Landesbank
Baden-Wuerttemberg.
<p>
Taking only the balance sheet as a measure the new bank will take position
6 among all big German banks with a balance sheet sum of 430 billion DEM.
Looking at the profitability figures it will even be at position 4. The
Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg will be an institution according to public
law, a universal bank, a central bank for the savings banks, a savings bank
in Stuttgart, a promotion and home bank for the state and a national and
international business bank. The merger is a very interesting matter
because the Landesgirokasse, Germany's second largest savings bank, will
become part of the new bank, which will receive full freedom of business
and settlement.

Local councils will not increase fees despite higher deficit
</H1>
Despite their empty coffers, towns and communities will not increase their
service fees. The President of the council of German cities, Roth said in
Bonn that more considerations have to be taken to outsource some services,
e.g. the sanitation service. Although communities reduced their
expenditures by 2.5% the deficit rose to 9 billion DEM, because of a
decreased intake of 6.6 billion DEM. Ms. Roth emphasised that further
savings would be impossible, because the social network would collapse.
According to her the federal government and the federal states are also
responsible for the communities' financial troubles.
