4.22 million unemployed in June
</H1>
A change of winds on the employment market has failed to materialize even
in June. President of the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda, however,
pointed out that for the first time for several months indications have
increased that the downward trend is coming to an end at least in West
Germany. The number of unemployed declined by about 33,000 to 4.22 million.
The rate of unemployment was 11 percent after 11.1 % in May and 9.9 % one
year ago. There were 438,000 more people unemployed in June this year than
last year. In Baden-Wuerttemberg there were roughly 369,000 people without
employment, the rate declined from 7.7 to 7.5 percent. In Bavaria circa
404,000 unemployed were counted, a decline by 14,000.
In view of the numbers, the Social-Democrats accused the government of
serious failure. Deputy president of the Bundestag faction Ottmar Schreiner
said that  last year the government had presented the so-called saving
package as a measure towards more employment. In reality, however, the
number of unemployed today was way higher than before the adoption of the
package.
CDU secretary-general Peter Hintze admitted that the break-through on the
job market has not been achieved yet. He called on the economy to
consequently use the room created by the government to provide more
employment.

Still more than 280,000 looking for trainee positions
</H1>
Two months before the start of the trade school year the employment offices
had still 280,000 youngsters without a trainee job on the record. Only
112,000 open positions were available. Thus, there were two positions for
every five applicants and, in the East, one position for every seven.
Education Minister Juergen Ruettgers called for more training appeals. The
National Federation of Unions, DGB, demanded to make job training
obligatory for companies.

Constitutional Court: Firing of civil servants to be decided case by case
</H1>
Former unofficial collaborators with the East-German state security, Stasi,
and officers of the Communist party must not be fired as civil servants
without checking each case individually according to a ruling by the
Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, the Court ruled in favour of five
former Stasi employees and officers and returned the cases to the labour
courts. Although the senate confirmed that the special termination
regulations are basically constitutional, the employer, however, had to
consider the circumstances in each case.
After 1990, thousands of civil servants have been fired in the eastern
states because they had been Stasi collaborators or high-ranking Communist
party officers.

Probing talks about tax reform without result
</H1>
Probing talks between government and opposition about potential compromises
in the tax reform have been ended without result. Now, talks would have to
continue in the Mediation Committee of Bundestag and Bundesrat the day
after tomorrow, said FDP politician Carl-Ludwig Thiele. The talks had
failed over disagreement about how to finance the planned abolition of the
local trade tax on capital. Thiele accused again the SPD of barricading.
They wanted to abolish the tax only according to their conditions.

Collective bargaining in Baden-Wuerttemberg retail sector adjourned
</H1>
Collective bargaining for about 220,000 employees of the Baden-Wuerttemberg
retail sector has been adjourned. A new meeting has been scheduled for the
end of September but a date has not been fixed. A spokesperson for the
Trade, Banking and Insurance Union (HBV) said there were insurmountable
gaps between employers and employees. As before, the employers demand
something in return for keeping full sick pay. The German Union of
employees (DAG) and the HBV union demand higher wages.

Internet to remain unregulated
</H1>
Companies, consumers, and private people will be able to use the internet
in Europe with minimal government regulation. This was the result agreed on
by 29 European states after a two-day minister conference in Bonn. A
so-called Bonn Declaration stipulates that the right on free speech and on
coding of data will be maintained. Governments also renounce to levy new
taxes or fees. It will be the task of the government to enable all citizens
to use the new technology. The arising of global information networks was
an extremely positive development and offered great opportunities for more
economic growth.
