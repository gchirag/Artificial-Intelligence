OeTV makes high demands in wage negotiations
</H1>
The German Public Services and Transport Union (OeTV) seems
to insist on considerable raises during the wage negotiations in the field of
passenger and freight traffic. A spokesman of the union mentioned a raise of
an average three to five percent. The negotiations for the 550,000 employees
will take place in about 30 separate districts. The OeTV also aims for a
continued 100% payment to sick workers, a rapid adjustment of East-German
salaries to West-German standards, and an improvement of industrial safety.
<P>
By virtue of the fact that there exists an essential wage differential
between public and private employers, the OeTV would like to get an area wage
agreement accepted. The negotiations are supposed to begin next week.

Considerable police detachment for castor transport
</H1>
Lower Saxony's Secretary of the Interior Glogowski obviously doubted
the security of the castor transport in the up-coming week. DER SPIEGEL
reports that Glogowski asked his fellow secretaries in other German states to
send at least 2,100 more police officers to Lower Saxony. Otherwise he would
not be able to guarantee that the transport would be carried out in an orderly
manner.  Police officials made known, however, that the support of additional
police was already confirmed.
<P>
It is not known how many police officers and members of the Federal Border
Guard will be brought into action. But there are estimates that a total of
almost 19,000 officers throughout the Federal Republic are supposed to protect
the transport of the castor container.
<P>
Lower Saxony approved the storage of six radioactive waste containers in the
intermediate storage facility in Gorleben last Friday.

Tax talks I: Schaeuble - Put party's political interests on back burner
</H1>
The CDU/CSU floor leader in the German parliament Schaeuble regards
talks with the SPD starting on Monday as just the beginning of further
negotiations. Schaeuble mentioned in a SPIEGEL interview that the pressure to
resolve politico-economic problems is great enough to put party-politics on
the back burner.

Tax talks II: Scharping puts damper on hope
</H1>
SPD and CDU/CSU want to begin a discussion of the tax reform on Monday.
Schaeuble added that these talks will be continued if they are successful.
Then, it might be possible to discuss many issues. SPD floor leader
Scharping, however, put a damper on any hopes of quickly reaching an agreement
with the CDU/CSU. He told the FRANKFURTER ALLGEMEINEN SONNTAGSZEITUNG that he
is very skeptical of the coalition's ability to achieve a solution.
Furthermore, Scharping told the FRANFURTER RUNDSCHAU that the SPD will never
agree on a taxation of extra payments to shift workers. The SPD will also
refuse to discuss any infringement on the old-age pension and life insurance
system.

Tax talks III: Kohl wants to send a reform signal
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl sees a chance that the tax talks between the coalition and
the SPD will send an important signal of Germany's wish and ability to reform.
In an interview with the newspaper WELT AM SONNTAG, Mr. Kohl made an appeal to
the Social Democrats to use their majority in the Upper House in the interest
of the unemployed persons in Germany.
<P>
Mr. Kohl also suggested that it might be possible to enforce parts of the tax
reform as early as January 1, 1998 as long as it is possible to guarantee its
concept and its financing.

Tax talks IV: Gerhardt wants decision before Easter

FDP party leader Gerhardt argues in favor of a decision on tax reform
before Easter. He said at a party convention of the Thuringian FDP that it

reform failed.

Engelhardt demands more solidarity but also more individual responsibility
</H1>
The chairman of the Protestant Church in Germany (EKD), Mr, Engelhardt
suggested that a common appeal of the Catholic and Protestant Church should
strengthen social consensus in Germany. During an interview with the radio
station DEUTSCHLANDFUNK, he mentioned that this social consensus might
disappear if individual groups were only aware of their singular interests. He
also argued in favor of more individual responsibility but warned of an
elbowing mentality. Society would be destroyed if it were not supported by all
social groups. At this point, he renewed the claim of the Protestant Church
that stronger shoulders have to carry the heavier burden.
<P>
In Hannover today, the Council of the Protestant Church approved the common
appeal of the churches. Engelhardt and Chairman of the Catholic Bishops'
Conference Lehmann will meet for a talk on Sunday afternoon.

Rally against right-wing extremism in Magdeburg
</H1>
Several thousand persons demonstrated against right-wing violence
two weeks after the killing of a young punk in Magdeburg. The police reported
about 2,000 participants while the organizers estimated that almost 4,000
persons participated--most of them members of the left and autonomous
political spectrum.
<P>
More than 1,000 police officers and members of the Federal Border Guard
controlled the area around Magdeburg prior to the demonstration to prevent
the arrival of demonstrators who might have been willing to use force.
<P>
An anti-fascist alliance initiated the rally which was supported by the
government of Saxony-Anhalt, the parliamentary factions of SPD and PDS as
well as the city of Magdeburg.
<P>
The reason for the demonstration was the killing of a 17 year old punk two
weeks ago. Last Thursday the police arrested a 17 year old right-wing
teenager. In the meantime, he has confessed that he committed the crime alone.

Senter criticizes French demand for stability council
</H1>
The stability council for the European Monetary Union called for by
France should have only informal functions according to EU-Commission
President Santer. In no case should the formation of such a political body
lessen the independence of the European Central Bank, Santer stated today at a
small state party meeting of the CDU of Baden-Wuerttemberg in Buehl.
Representatives of the federal government as well as those of other EU-
countries also expressed their reservations about creating a stability
council.
<P>
At this meeting, the CDU of Baden-Wuerttemberg emphatically favored starting
the European Monetary Union in 1999. The Southwest-CDU issued a lead motion
which warns against trade wars and job losses if the historical opportunity
for a currency union is lost.

Bible from the days of Luther was not reformer's own
</H1>
A bible from the days of Luther that was discovered two years ago
in Stuttgart apparently did not belong to the reformer. Experts declared
after a three-day conference in Stuttgart's state library that this bible was
not written by Martin Luther himself. The handwriting coincided with Luther's
but represented merely  the typical penmanship of those days. The writer of
that bible might have lived in Saxony where he could have had access to
Luther's original manuscripts. They concluded that the hypothesis that Luther
used this bible when he translated the New Testament at the Wartburg was
definitely untenable.
