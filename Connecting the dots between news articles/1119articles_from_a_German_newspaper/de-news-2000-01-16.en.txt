SPD wants to overthrow Mr. Koch
</H1>
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) of Hesse might try to overthrow State
Premier Mr. Koch of the Christian Democratic Party (CDU). The SPD informed
that the state executive and parliamentary party will decide tomorrow
[Monday] in a special session if they will make a motion of no confidence
against Mr. Koch in the Hessian State Parliament. The SPD is of the opinion
that the CDU financed the election campaign last year with illegal funds and
won the election because of that advantage. Therefore, there must be new
elections. In the State Parliament, the government of CDU and FDP has a
majority of only two votes. Former federal Minister of the Interior and CDU
state Party President Mr. Kanther had taken responsibility for illegal party
accounts abroad.

Mr. Koch can not explain origin of millions
</H1>
State Premier Mr. Koch of Hesse has not been able to explain where millions
of marks in donations to the Hessian CDU come from. Mr. Koch told the
newspaper "Bild" that he can not exclude the possibility that the national
CDU got money from the foreign accounts of the Hessian party. About
speculations that the money could have to do with the Flick affair, Mr. Koch
said: "when you have been cheated for so long, you can not rule anything
out." The "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper claims to have proof that eight
million marks of the Hessian CDU come from the "Staatsbuergerliche
Vereinigung" ("Citizens' Association") and therefore have a connection with
the Flick affair. The accounts of "Staatsbuergerliche Vereinigung" were
emptied at the end of 1983. Since then, investigators have been looking for
eight million marks from these accounts, without success.

Mr. Koch and Mr. Schaeuble under pressure
</H1>
After the new revelations in the CDU finance scandal, Party President Mr.
Schaeuble and State Premier Mr. Koch of Hesse are under more and more
pressure. But both refuse to resign. Politicians of all parties warn of
damage to democracy. Mr. Schaeuble asked in an article in the weekly paper
"Welt am Sonntag" for solidarity and help in resolving the affair. The CDU,
as the big popular party of the political center, is too important for the
stability and future of the republic to allow it to be permanently damaged
by this affair. At the same time, the CDU President rejected reproaches that
he had manipulated files. CDU President of North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr.
Ruettgers, warned against power struggles within the party as a result of
the finance scandals.

Meanwhile, former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl canceled the acceptance of
the Adolph Bentinck Prize for merits toward Europe tomorrow. His office
manager explained that keeping this date seemed rather inappropriate at this
time.

ICE3 to go no faster than 200 km/h
</H1>
The new high speed train of the German railroad will not go faster than 200
km/h for the time being. The rail company confirmed that the train will be
slower than the older ICE types when it is first used during the world
exposition Expo 2000. The older ICE trains go up to 280 km/h. The reason are
backup brakes whose electro-magnetic radiation has interfered with signals
during test runs. The manufacturers, led by Siemens, committed to finding a
solution in the next months. The ICE3 is scheduled to commute with a speed
of 300 km/h on the new track between Frankfurt and Cologne.

BMW refutes rumors about cooperation
</H1>
BMW has refuted rumors about a planned cooperation with Volkswagen. Speaker
for the concern Mr. Maler said that the article in the magazine "Der
Spiegel" is nonsense. The news magazine wrote in its latest edition, citing
BMW insiders, that BMW President Mr. Milberg has discussed a possible
cooperation with VW Board Chairman Mr. Piech. The reported reason is losses
at the British BMW subsidiary Rover. It is possible that Rover could use the
platform of the new VW Polo for future models and that in exchange BMW would
leave its rights to the Rolls Royce name to Volkswagen.
