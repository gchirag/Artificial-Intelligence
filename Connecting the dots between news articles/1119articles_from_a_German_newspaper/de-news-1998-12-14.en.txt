</H1>
Talks between federal government and the energy sector on phasing
out nuclear power plants are to begin next January. The announcement
was made by chancellor Schroeder after initial tentative talks with
industry leaders in Bonn today. Schroeder said the gist of the talks
would be finding an orderly way to terminate nuclear energy
production. This would include setting specific dates for shutting
down every one of Germany's 19 reactor plants.

Lafontaine refuses to be nailed down on stark numbers
</H1>
Finance minister Lafontaine declared the government was not in a
position to establish precise quantification in the matter of
reducing unemployment rates. After a meeting of the governing
bodies in Bonn, the SPD chairman said there were too many
imponderables in the economic situation to allow giving out precise
quantification. He conceded having erred in not refuting outright
the figure of 3 million unemployed by end 2002 suggested by his
interviewer on ZDF-TV.

Muentefering tones down announcement on drivers' upper age limit
</H1>
Transportation minister Muentefering toned down his remarks on a
proposed upper age limit for drivers' licenses today. He had said
in a press interview that the same way there was an initial age
limit for youngsters he could imagine an upper limit for senior
citizens. "I meant to make clear that just as happened with young
persons, senior citizens should also reflect on their own fitness for
participating in traffic. This varies from individual to individual,
but all person have to bear in mind their personal responsibility.
When you grow older, you have to be careful about your eyesight
and ask yourself whether you are still fit for driving a car.
This is in the general interest of all participants in traffic, so
it is valid for senior citizens, too."
The federal seniors' league showed itself outraged and called the
proposal pure nonsense. They treat senior citizens like under-age
children in disregard of the fact that young persons are to be
blamed for most accidents.

Chairman of medical association apologizes for ironic remarks
</H1>
The chairman of the federal medical association, Vilmar, apologized
for his controversial comments on the government coalition's
health law plans. He said he meant to make people aware without
any intention of frightening would-be patients. His statement that
people might die at an earlier age because of the reduction of
doctors' fees was meant to be ironic. But it caused a tempestuous
uproar of indignation.

Wage talks by metal workers' union adjourned
</H1>
The first round of wage talks between employers and the metal
workers' union for Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, Rhineland-
Palatinate and Saarland was adjourned until January without any
approximation of points of view. Just as they had done in North
Rhine-Westphalia last week, the employers did not tender an offer.
Their aim is an agreement providing a certain percentile raise
and a one-time payment depending on the economic situation
of the companies concerned. The metal workers want a 6.5% boost.
In the banking sector, there was also no agreement in sight for
the 470,000 employees.

Bubis-Walser quarrel comes to an end
</H1>
Ignaz Bubis, chairman of Germany's Central Jewish Council, who
had accused writer Martin Walser of being a "spiritual incendiary",
took back this accusation today, not without the critical remark
that Walser, in his acceptance speech for the librarians' peace
prize, had expressed himself in a way that could easily be
misunderstood. Bubis said this after a personal talk with Walser
in Frankfurt/Main. Two months ago, on receiving the prize, Walser
had declared - among other matters - that holocaust remembrance
must not be instrumentalized and Auschwitz must not be used as
a moral blunt instrument.
