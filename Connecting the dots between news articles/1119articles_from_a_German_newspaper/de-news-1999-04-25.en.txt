NATO summit in Washington
</H1>
NATO wants to increase the military pressure on Yugoslavia,
to force Belgrade into compliance. The air attacks are to be
expanded. There will also be a naval blockade to prevent
deliveries of oil. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana is
examining the conditions for sending in ground troops. One
question that remained controversial at the meeting was
whether the alliance needs a mandate from the UN Security
Council for engagements outside the territory of NATO member
states, as UN Secretary-General Annan has again demanded. In
an interview, Annan said that whatever the force looked
like, it must be approved by the Security Council. He also
insisted that Russia must play a role in the search for a
political solution to the Kosovo conflict. Annan is
scheduled to arrive in Berlin tonight, and to remain in
Germany for three days. NATO's new strategic concept does
not necessarily require a UN mandate as a condition for
military engagement by the alliance; rather, it merely
acknowledges that the Security Council carries the primary
responsibility for the preservation of peace and security.
At the end of the summit, NATO discussed prospects for the
period following the Kosovo war. The heads of government and
state for the 19 members of the alliance agreed upon a
stability pact for the Balkans, in accordance with a German
suggestion, to be worked out at the end on May in Bonn. The
stability pact is to consist of three elements: in the short
term, to ensure security in the region and to build trust;
in the medium term, to support rebuilding and hence economic
stability; and in the long term, to promote a democratic and
civil society.

Ground troops in Kosovo?
</H1>
The German federal government has denied that Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder had promised German support for the
engagement of ground troops in Yugoslavia. According to a
report by the Reuters news agency, Schroeder had told the
American television news station CNN that Germany would go
along with the engagement of ground troops if NATO decided
in favour of such action. According to the government, he
said only that that was a matter for NATO to decide, and
NATO had not yet favoured such action.

Dispute over Sunday sales in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
The state government in Baden-Wuerttemberg is involved in a
debate over allowing shops to open on Sunday. State Economic
Minister Doering (FDP) wants more Sunday sales, and objects
to an idea from Social Minister Repnik (CDU) of allowing
only one shopping Sunday a year. Repnik suggests that Sunday
must be a day of reflection. Doering cites economics and
tourism as reasons for more possibilities of shopping on
Sunday. Current state law allows four Sundays a year for
shops to be open.

against wage reductions and overtime. They said that the
various organizations were trying to surpass one another in

and "Caritas" wanted not to honour the wage increases
recently accorded in the public sector, the workers
complained. Caregivers for seniors said that they worked 70
hours a week and were constantly being put under pressure.

Bruederle opposes compulsory military duty
</H1>
According to the deputy leader of the FDP, Bruederle,
compulsory military service in Germany has no future.
Experience in the war in Kosovo showed that the duties of a
modern troop could not be fulfilled by conscripts, Bruederle
said in a radio interview. He suggested that an army of
career soldiers with specific areas of expertise was the
army of the future. He also came out against sending ground
troops into Kosovo, while admitting, however, that a day may
come, when there would be no choice.
