Coalition contract signed
</H1>
The main objective of Germany's new federal government will be
the fighting of unemployment. After signing the coalition contract [with The
Greens] today, chancellor designate Gerhard Schroeder said to achieve
this goal an Alliance for Jobs needed to be set up that agreed on
concrete measures [to fight unemployment]. This Alliance should not just
be an invitation to a single meeting but would rather become a permanent
institution. Occasional refusals voiced by industry spokespersons will
not let the government deviate from this course, Mr Schroeder stressed.
His future deputy and Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer underlined that
a positive change in trend on the job market will be the yardstick the
new coalition government wants its success to be measured with. Both
men called the coalition contract a reliable base for its [future]
government.

<P>
The parties of the former coalition government strongly criticised
the contract. CDU head designate Wolfgang Schaeuble said the red-green
coalition contract was a document of the Old Left and a disappointmemt
for all those who had believed in Mr Schroeder's promisses. The scrapping
of already introduced reforms will lead to burdens of several billion DM,
in particular in the pension systems. Head of the CSU members of parliament
Michael Glos especially attacked the proposed changes of citizenships
laws. The toleration of a dual nationality did not help integration
[of foreigners] but jeopardized it.

Stollmann criticises Lafontaine
</H1>
After renouncing his ambitions to become Federal Economics
Minister, Entrepreneur Jost Stollmann has strongly criticised SPD head
Oskar Lafontaine. In the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" newspaper, Mr Stollmann
wrote the SPD head had dominated the negotiations of the coalition
contract [with The Greens]. Moreover, the key positions [in the new
government and in the SPD] have been filled according to the will of
Mr Lafontaine. Mr Stollmann considers his retreat in particular as
a weakening of the reformers within the Social Democrats; he said:
"Failed have those for the time being who wanted to implement the
concepts of the New Center".

Employers associations strongly criticise tax plans
</H1>
The leading confederations of the German industry have strongly
criticised the red-green coalition contract, in particular the planned
tax reform that was branded an employment killer. Federation of German
Industry (BDI) head Olaf Henkel called the concept a "gigantic
deception package". The planned taxation of energy was poison for the
job market. President of the employers' association Dieter Hundt
coined the phrase of a "deterrence programme" for investors and called
the tax plans expensive, rigid and hostile to the creation of new jobs.
The President of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, Mr Stihl,
expects a further increase in the number of unemployed persons. The
Chambers of Commerce of the "Mittelstand" [medium sized companies,
usually family owned] consider the tax reform bill bad for their
members.

Economists call for courageous tax reform
</H1>
Leading economists have criticised the tax reform proposals
of the future government as being inadequate. One could not expect
to trigger any impulses for growth or on the job market with such
a reform, said Germany's six leading economic institutions at the
presentation of their joint autumn report. To send a strong signal for
new jobs,  a reform was needed that visibly lowered tax rates
and that abandoned tax loop holes to a great extent. Public finances
were in better shape than feared by the incoming government, thus
allowing such a big reform. But obviously Social Democrats and The
Greens did not have the courage to do so.

<P>
In its economic forecast, the institutes said the crisis in Asia,
Russia and Latin America would slow down growth [in Germany]. The
gross national product (GNP) is expected to grow by 2.3, down from
an earlier forecast of 2.7%. The number of unemployed people is
forecasted to fall by 210.000 to an annual average of 4.07 million.

Lafontaine: SPD profile still distinctively different from Greens
</H1>
After the coalition contract between the Social Democrats and
the Greens was signed, SPD head Oskar Lafontaine stressed the difference
of the two parties. In a public meeting of the parliamentary party
of the SPD, Mr Lafontaine said they [the SPD] would not make the
mistake to get their image damaged through cooperation with a small
party, as the CDU had done in its coalition with the Liberals.
The coalition contract fixes the key points of the future work of
the government, such as the fight against unemployment, an ecological
tax reform and the phasing out of nuclear energy.

<P>
Meanwhile further details of the proposed tax reform got known,
according to which taxation o staff rebates will be increased.
This concerns in particular employees in the car construction
and the retail sectors.

"Mehmet" can be expelled
</H1>
After a ruling by the Bavarian Administrative Court the 14-year-old serial
offender "Mehmet" must expect his expulsion. The court rejected the
complaint against that Mehmet's residence permit had not been extended. The
judges found it could be reasonably expected that one parent accompanies
Mehmet to Turkey or that the youngster stays with relatives. Bavarian
Minister of Interior Mr Beckstein announced that the youngster would be
expelled immediately. Munich's district administrative officer Mr
Blume-Beyerle said only the technical details for the expulsion had to be
settled. The Bavarian B90/Greens called the court's ruling cynical and a
violation of human rights.
