EU agrees to compact on stability as proposed by Mr Waigel
</H1>
The EU-heads of state agreed to a compact on stability for the planned
setting-up of the European Currency Union. According to the agreement,
countries whose budget deficits are too high, will have to pay a penalty.
The compromise they agreed to in Dublin, however, also provides for
exceptions, in case a country suffers a major recession during more than one
year causing gross domestic product (GDP) to shrink by more than .75%.
This compact had been proposed by German Federal Minister of Finance, Mr
Waigel, a year ago. After agreement had been reached in Dublin, Mr Waigel
said that this would indicate quite clearly that the Euro would become a
strong currency. Today the future Euro-banknotes were presented for the
first time. They are to feature the different architectural styles used in
Europe.

Vast majority of members of parliament for sending troops to Bosnia
</H1>
An overwhelming majority of members of parliament voted for another
deployment of German armed forces in Bosnia (some 3,3000 soldiers),
serving under SFOR. Government and opposition party SPD agreed that Germany
had to do more to guarantee peace in Bosnia. Last night the UN Security
Council had given the green light for a 30,000 strong SFOR contingent. The
deployment is to last 18 months.

Discussion about new brief for German armed forces in Bosnia
</H1>
Mr Joschka Fischer, of the Greens/Alliance90 party, accused the government
of trying to assign the German armed forces duties beyond NATO-boundaries.
He pleaded for leaving the soldiers in Bosnia, but they should get a proper
UN-mandate for the job.

<P>
Defence Minister Ruehe vigorously opposed this claim: such a mandate would
entail battle-orders, and the latter would be far more dangerous to German
soldiers. At the same time, Mr Ruehe declared that the German armed forces
brief had in fact changed, as they would at long last be on equal footing
with the other NATO-soldiers.

North German metal-workers' award not settled yet

in Northern Germany had not been settled. The bone of contention continues
to be paid sick-leave. Meanwhile there was a wild-cat strike in a factory
in Schleswig-Holstein: numerous staff working on night-shift at a Flensburg
company temporarily stopped work.

Mr Lopez, ex-head of purchasing at VW, taken to court
</H1>
The public prosecutor in Darmstadt will take Mr Lopez, former head of
purchasing at Volkswagen, to court. He is alleged to have broken
industrial confidentiality and to have embezzled confidential documents.
Investigations, however, could not tell if Volkswagen did know about these
matters.
Volkswagen now think that this confirms that there had been no collusion by
their CEO's, and no damage was done to GM/Opel, and that's why they assume
their chances for an out-of-court settlement are getting better (instead of
fighting it out in a US-court where GM was claiming damages). Volkswagen
representatives expect a meeting between themselves and GM as early as
around Christmas. Today's news from the public prosecutor would have paved
the way for such a move, and head of VW, Mr Piech, allegedly already is in
the US. Opel, however, said that Volkswagen tried to brush aside the
criminal-law accusations against Mr Lopez: VW would not yet be in the clear.

Re-organisation of public radio in South-West Germany makes good progress
</H1>
After a third round of talks, the state premiers of Rhine-land/Palatinate
and Baden-Wuerttemberg declared that the talks about reorganising public
radio in the south-western part of Germany should be finished by autumn
1997. The next meeting will be on 23 January, and it should also include
the directors of Suedwestfunk, Mr Voss, and his counterpart at
Sueddeutscher Rundfunk, Mr Fuenfgeld.
There also was some progress as far as the membership of future committees
was concerned. Out of 10 members of the administrative committee, 7 should
be from Baden-Wuerttemberg whereas 3 would be Rhine-land/Palatinate members.
The future 'Rundfunkrat' is to have 60 members.

Police arrest ATM-burglars
</H1>
Karlsruhe police arrested a gang specialising in robbing automatic
teller-machines (ATM's) and cash-dispensers. The perpetrators are alleged
to have netted more than 500,000 marks during recent raids. The 4 criminals,
aged between 26 and 46 years, allegedly broke into at least 12 ATM's
situated in banks' foyers. On 14 June 1996, late at night, the well-organised
gang broke into the Gruenwettersbach branch office, near Karlsruhe. As
always, the gang-members (who are no strangers to police and courts) picked
a branch office in a rural area, relatively far from the next police
station. They gained access to the foyer using a credit-card. So far,
however, not a single banknote of the loot has been found.
