</H1>

with representatives of human rights organizations, he described the current
state to be as depressing as in the past.  Kinkel's visit was overshadowed by

New steel group to be formed on April 1st
</H1>
Thyssen and Krupp-Hoesch announced today the details of their fusion signed
yesterday.  The new enterprise, which will be the largest steel group in
Europe, will come into existence as early as April 1, according to Thyssen
chairman Mr. Vogel.  Thyssen will hold sixty per cent of the shares and will
assume control of industrial production.  The new company will bear the name
"Thyssen-Krupp Stahl."  Vogel reaffirmed that there would be no job cuts due
to changes in the operational structure of the company.  However, he noted
that a total of 6600 jobs would have to be cut in the steel industries overall
by the year 2001.  He added that employees at the location Duisburg could
expect favorable treatment, and the workers agreed to resume production.  The
employees demanded, however, that all promises made by Vogel and Kromme be put
down in a legally binding document, otherwise they threatened with new
strikes.  The chairman of the union for metal, engineering, and electronics
[IG Metall] in North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Schartau, expects a continuation of
the protests, even after a basic agreement will have been signed.  The Thyssen
executive board agreed to the merger today.

Engelen-Kefer calls for revision of the Maastricht Treaty
</H1>
The deputy chair of the German Federation of Trade Unions [DGB], Ms.
Engelen-Kefer, has called for a revision of the Maastricht Treaty.  In an
interview with the Dusseldorf-based financial newspaper "Handelsblatt", she
proposed that the treaty be expanded to include guidelines for employment
policy.  She added that she considered an exact adherence to the deficit
criterion unnecessary.  The limits for unemployment, on the other hand,
require definition, she said.  Engelen-Kefer further noted that it was
imperative to stick to the deadline for the currency union.
