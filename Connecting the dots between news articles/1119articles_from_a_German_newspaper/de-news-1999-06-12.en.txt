KFOR troops deployed in Kosovo
</H1>
It is the largest military action since the end of World War II. KFOR
troops are marching into Kosovo, including 200 Bundeswehr soldiers who are
on the way to their base in Prisren. Tomorrow morning, an additional 1,200
Bundeswehr soldiers are expected. Not only KFOR troupes but also 200
Russian soldiers have marched to Prisren and set up camp in a night
lightning operation. NATO has criticized this action. Now, NATO General
Jackson has landed in Pristina to negotiate with the Russian commander. It
is unclear in what way the Russians are working with the KFOR
force. Negotiations on Russia's role continue.

<P>
When the entire peace-keeping force reaches its positions, the next step is
to rebuild Kosovo. Germany will certainly be involved in this process but
taxes will not be increased to do so. This was promised by Federal Finance
Minister Eichel after the G-7 meeting of finance ministers in Frankfurt. In
addition, Mr. Eichel warned against allocating a lot of money at this early
stage for rebuilding Kosovo. "Do not misunderstand me--it is not that the
finance ministers are being tight-fisted. Rather, we want to ensure that
the money reaches the right people and can be used to achieve the desired
purposes," stated Mr. Eichel. According to the finance minister, the fist
reliable estimates on the costs to rebuild will be available in the fall at
the earliest.

Meeting of G7 finance ministers
</H1>
The finance ministers of the seven leading industrial nations have begun
their meeting in Frankfurt am Main. Some key areas to be addressed are
financial issues and international debt management. The Russian minister
Michael Kasyanov is also expected. The finance ministers are also preparing
for the  summit between G7 state and government leaders and Russia to take
place next weekend. "This is not to be an academic discussion," noted
Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin in the context of the meeting.
Reforms are on the agenda and the ministers want to adapt the world
financial system to a new architecture for the 21st century.

<P>
One issue on the agenda is a plan for the debt remission of the forty
poorest countries in the world. It is believed that this issue is the most
likely to garner support from all sides. On the other hand, a more more
sensitive issue is Kosovo an the role Russia is to play. According to US
President Clinton, the Europeans should pay the majority of costs necessary
to rebuild Kosovo. This request was rejected by the Europeans as hasty.

<P>
More credit for Russia's suffering economy are not expected. However, it is
clear that Russia's role as an intermediary in the Kosovo crisis should be
rewarded in one way or another.

<P>
Twenty months ago, the collapse of the Thai currency caused a world-wide
financial crisis from which many countries have not fully recovered. The G7
ministers are trying to develop some comprehensive financial defense
mechanisms to avoid such scenarios in the future. The IMF and the World
Bank should play a role in this process.

Dioxin scandal expanding to include other poisons
</H1>
The scandal of dioxin-contaminated foodstuffs from Belgium has now expanded
to include other poisons.  In North Rhine-Westfalia, inspectors have
discovered polychlorinated biphenyls, commonly known as PCBs, in Belgian
eggs.  These chemicals are used in hydraulic machinery, among other things.
They are very poisonous and can damage the human nervous and metabolic
systems.  Although only a few eggs were badly affected, the Ministry in
Bonn intends to conduct wider tests to ascertain the level of PCBs in
Belgian foodstuffs in general.  Federal Health Minister Karl-Heinz Funke is
deliberating whether Germany should demand damages for both the spoiled
goods and the cost of inspections.

Warning strikes in Bavarian retail sector
</H1>
The unions have called for beefed-up warning strikes in the wake of the
failed third round of wage negotiations in the Bavarian retail sector. The
biggest strikes were in Franconia, and especially in Nuremberg.  Over 600
employees involved in retail are supposed to have taken part in the protest
actions.  The Kaufhof and Karstatt stores in both downtown Nuremberg and in
Langwasser were affected.  A spokesman for the Union of Retail, Bank and
Insurance Workers said that the walkouts would continue at least through
noon.

Entertainment expenses will no longer be tax deductible
</H1>
According to a story in "Der Spiegel," neither corporations nor individual
entrepreneurs will be able to deduct entertainment expenses in the future.
This step would bring around a billion marks into the Treasury, and is part
of a budget package that Hans Eichel, the Finance Minister, is planning to
use to offset lower corporate taxes, according to the magazine.  In
addition, "Der Spiegel" forecast that several agricultural tax breaks would
be rescinded, included reduced prices for diesel fuel.

Thriller in Berlin: SV Werder Bremen is the German cup winner
</H1>
The German cup winner was determined today in Berlin during a thrilling
game between Bayern Muenchen and SV Werder Bremen. The score remained 1:1
after 90 minutes - and stayed that way after 120 minutes as well. Mario
Basler, who had already established himself in the first half as enfant
terrible, was forced to leave the field with a yellow-red card in the 114th
minute. During the first five 11-meter penalty kicks, Todt from Werder
Bremen and Effenberg from Bayern Muenchen missed their shots. After the SV
Werder goalkeeper Rost, who had played excellently the entire game, scored
during his penalty kick, Lothar Matthaeus became the goat of the game.
Rost's penalty shot allowed Werder Bremen to win the game 6:5.
