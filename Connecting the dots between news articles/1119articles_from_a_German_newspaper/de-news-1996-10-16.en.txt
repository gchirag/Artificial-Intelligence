Arrests but no sign of victim in Fiszmann kidnapping case
</H1>
Two weeks after the abduction of Frankfurt businessman
Fiszmann, police have arrested five suspects. The three men and two
women are considered the likely main perpetrators by the Hesse state LKA
Criminal Investigations Bureau, which said the five had made partial
confessions. However, there were no links to the Russian mafia, despite
speculations to the contrary. One of the female suspects was a
long-standing employee of the Fiszmann company, a spokesperson for the
LKA said. The four-million-mark ransom, missing just two 1,000
deutschmark bills, was confiscated on a property in Wiesbaden. However,
there is no sign of life or any trace of the kidnapping victim himself,
according to police, who said no statement at all was possible on
Fiszmann's fate. This morning, police had conducted several major raids
in the Rhine-Main area, discovering the ransom money in the garden of a
Wiesbaden flat. Police suspect that there is one more perpetrator. A
telephone announcement playing back the man's voice has been
established. Fiszmann had been abducted on October 1 and had not been
released despite the payment of four million marks of ransom. The last
conclusive sign of life by the 40-year-old millionaire was a phone call
on October 2.

is accompanied by leading members of the civil rights movement in the
former East Germany. Europe will be the main focus of the visit. Herzog
started his visit by emphasising the importance of the Franco-German

New animal protection bill and social insurance contribution limits
</H1>
Federal Cabinet has approved the draft of a new animal protection
law. It raises the age at which adolescents are permitted to purchase
pets from now 14 to 16 years. Import regulations for animals will also
be toughened up. Breeders and transporters of animals will have to hold
certain qualifications in future. The ban on animal testing will be
extended to all cosmetics products. Animal protection lobbyists and the
opposition parties said the bill did not go far enough. The German RSPCA
said the new law did nothing to improve the intolerable situation in the
mass farming of animals. Things were even going to get worse in animal
testing, as a relaxation of controls was planned, the organisation said.
Cabinet today also set new contribution limits for social insurance. In
western Germany, the entry point for paying pensions insurance
contributions will rise to 8,200 marks, for health insurance
contributions it will be 6,150 marks. The new figures will have to be
approved by the Bundesrat upper house.

Debate over petrol tax rise
</H1>
The government coalition is discussing a petrol tax rise for the
coming year. After a summit meeting of the CDU/CSU "Union" and the
Liberal Democrats FDP at the Chancellor's Office however, a statement
was released saying that no firm decision had been reached yet on the
matter. The petrol tax rise was merely discussed in case the SPD Social
Democrats were not prepared to consent to further spending cuts in order
to finance the child care rebate increase and the abolition of the
capital tax. Economics Minister Rexrodt said this was a topic to be
discussed. SPD chief negotiator Voscherau blamed the government for
additional deficits. Reports in the media had spoken of plans by the CSU
to raise the petrol tax by 10 to 15 pfennigs per liter. The reason is
the row over the 1997 annual tax law. The simultaneous child rebate rise
and abolition of capital tax are projected to cost some 13 billion
marks, with more than half of this sum not yet funded.

Lafontaine: joint front of Social Democrats and trade unions
</H1>
SPD chairman Lafontaine has called for a joint front of
Social Democrats and trade unions in defending the welfare state.
Speaking at the national conference of the DAG German employees' union
in Magdeburg, Lafontaine stressed that Germany's standing as a place to
invest and do business in was not going to be maintained by outdated
means such as lowering company taxes or cutting social benefits.
SPD social policy spokesman Dressler told the convention that the SPD
was going to reverse the cuts to paid sick leave if it won government in
Bonn. Until such time, strong unions had to rule out that employers
applied on a grand scale the possibilities offered by the new law.
Dressler accused the Federal Government of wanting to make health
insurance resemble the private insurance industry. This was gradually
pushing out the solidarity financing element of health insurance.
The 190 delegates at the 16th DAG national conference today approved
unanimously a new set of basic statutes. For instance, the union names a
fairer distribution of national income as a main goal of its politics.
The union also rejects any attacks on the freedom of collective
bargaining, especially the introduction of opening-up clauses in wage
bargaining agreements.

Supplementary budget passed in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
The state parliament today passed the second supplementary
budget for 1996 with the votes of the CDU and FDP coalition. The budget
includes drastic cuts in all sectors in order to close a funding gap of
more than one billion marks. The SPD opposition had moved to put off the
second supplementary budget this year, arguing that its numbers were
superseded as the government had decreed a general clamp-down on
spending. The Greens also labelled the budget "fictitious". Finance
Minister Mayer-Vorfelder on the other hand said the clamp-down was
merely a precautionary measure. The second supplementary budget covers
61.5 billion marks.

corporations. He singled out Bremen and the Saar as targets.
