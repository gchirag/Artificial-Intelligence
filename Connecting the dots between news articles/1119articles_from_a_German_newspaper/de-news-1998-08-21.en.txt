Kohl endorses US military action
</H1>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agrees with US military attacks against
targets in Sudan and Afghanistan. Kohl said in Bonn the German government
condemns vehemently any kind of terrorism. It is therefore supporting any
action that serves the fighting of this scourge of the international
community. Yesterday, the USA had attacked presumed terrorist bases in
Afghanistan and Sudan as a response to bomb attacks on US embassies in East
Africa.

<P>
SPD deputy faction leader Guenther Verheugen called the military action a
tough and decisive response to a murderous, terrorist threat. A final
judgement of the attacks, however, could only be made when it has become
clear which targets the USA had really attacked in Afghanistan and Sudan.
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel stressed that the government agreed with
American President Bill Clinton that the attacks were not targeted against
Islam or Afghanistan or Sudan but only against international terrorism.
Both Kohl and Verheugen refuted speculations that Clinton had tried to use
the attacks to divert from the Lewinsky affaire.

New diary of Anne Frank
</H1>
The world-renown diary of the Jewish girl Anne Frank will be published in
an extended version early next year. The five additional pages that had
been discovered recently purportedly contain critical remarks about Anne
Frank's parents' marriage. The Frank family had been able to hide from the
Nazis in Amsterdam from 1942 to 1944 before the family was betrayed.

Kohl appoints council
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has appointed a voluntary council. The council for
Future and Innovation headed by Jenoptik CEO Lothar Spaeth is to make
suggestions for the further reform of Germany as a business location. The
experts are to keep an eye especially on the restructuring of the new
federal states. Kohl and Spaeth did not want to make the council's
foundation an election action. In support of this notion, Spaeth wants to
name the 15 members of the council only after the federal elections. His
aim is to re-organize political communication because the speed of changes
is increasing continuously. The Chancellor had asked the former state
premier of Baden-Wuerttemberg and now president of Jenoptik AG to lead the
council; a surprising step. Nine years ago, Spaeth was one of Kohl's
fiercest opponents within his own party. Today, CDU leader Kohl points out
joint experiences. In particular, Kohl praised Spaeth's great experience in
politics and economics. The rouble crisis and the financial difficulties in
Asia show, in Kohl's view, the importance of external expertise.
