CDU fails to shoot down law on so-called McJobs
</H1>
The CDU-governed states' initiative to shoot down the laws on the
so-called McJobs and nominally independent contract work in the Upper House
(Bundesrat) was a flop. A remit by the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg failed to
attract a majority of votes. State Premier Teufel called the new regulations
devastating as far as economic policies were concerned, whereas State
Premier Clement of North-Rhine/Westphalia admitted that there could be
problems. If things did not work out, the laws would have to get amended.
Before this debate the Upper House (Bundesrat) had agreed in principle to
a reform of the law on citizenship.

Ministry presents first draft for reform of health sector
</H1>
The planned reform of the health sector is to guarantee good care for the
patient and stable contributions, according to a first draft document.
Mr Jordan said the main points would be strengthening the position of
general practitioners, a reform of how hospitals would be paid for and a
strict cap on expenses by health insurers. And apart from that there would
be more emphasis on prevention and protection of patients. This draft is
to be made into law at the end of June, to be tabled in parliament
(Bundestag) by then. The Federal Association of Health Insurers (KBV)
criticised that the proposals would reinforce old, superseded structures.
The German Society for Hospitals said that patients would be worse off.

the policeman twice, though he said he had not hit his head. Three of the
four defendants said they were sorry. They have been accused of having
almost killed the policeman following a soccer match. The public prosecutor
wants them for attempted murder, having caused grievous bodily harm and
sedition.

Federal Court of Justice (BGH) on genocide committed abroad
</H1>
The Federal Court of Justice at Karlsruhe has ruled in principle that German
courts of law may also rule on genocide committed outside Germany. The
court ruled against the appeal of Bosnian Serb Jorgic. The 52-year old man
had been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Dusseldorf Higher Regional
Court. As leader of a paramilitary group he had killed a total of 30 Muslims
in the Doboj district in 1992, according to the court. Defence claimed that
this had been no genocide, and also that this was not Germany's business.

German-Polish summit meeting
</H1>
Mainly European items had been on the German-Polish summit meeting's
agenda last Friday in Danzig. The items included the Kosovo crisis,
co-operation with NATO and the extension of economical contacts, according
to Poland's head of state Buzek. Chancellor Schroeder pleaded for making
sure Polish forced labourers, who had to work in Germany during the Third
Reich, should not be worse off than non-Polish Nazi victims, as far as
payouts from the planned fund to be set up by German business were concerned.
In the future these summit meetings are to take place every year, instead of
every other year as in the past.

Upper House (Bundesrat) for reform of law on citizenship
</H1>
A majority of votes in the Upper House (Bundesrat) backed the coalition's
proposal for the reform of the law on citizenship. In the future, children
born (to foreign nationals) in Germany are to be granted German citizenship
as well. They will have to decide which citizenship they want to keep once
they turn 21. The new regulations are also to apply to children who are 10
years or less when the new regulations become law. This morning the Upper
House (Bundesrat) had elected Hesse's State Premier Koch (CDU) as
their president.
