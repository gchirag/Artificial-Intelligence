Flood waters
</H1>
Continuous rainfall in the past two days has led to the worst floods in years
in the Alps foothills in Bavaria, and in Austria and Switzerland.  Two men
drowned in a flooded basement in Bavaria.  Whole communities are isolated,
entire streets are impassable, and local drinking water has become
contaminated.  The fire and police departments, the Red Cross, and the
technical assistance were working at full force.  There are also high flood
waters in Austria and Switzerland. After several mudslides and heavy flooding
occurred in Tirol and Vorarlberg, emergency alarms were sounded.  The
situation is equally bad in parts of central and eastern Switzerland.

Kosovo conflict
</H1>
NATO is hoping for a rapid conclusion to the Kosovo conflict.  NATO
spokesperson Mr. Shea stated in Brussels that the Alliance would like to
force the Yugoslav leadership to relent in a few weeks.  This scenario would
allow the refugees to return to Kosovo before winter breaks.  Federal
Chancellor Schroeder called for the airstrikes to continue in order to put
increased pressure on Belgrade.  In a newspaper interview, Mr. Schroeder
stated that political figures must remain consistent in their policy, even if
public support begins to wane.

Heaviest strikes on Yugoslavia since Kosovo crisis began
</H1>
NATO has reportedly been much less successful in its air strikes against
Yugoslavia than military leaders might have expected.  The newspaper Welt am
Sonntag makes this report based on a secret file in its possession.  These
sobering facts are forcing NATO to take stock of the situation, including the
extent of the damage done to Yugoslav command posts.  The secret report also
attributes the crash of an Apache combat helicopter to a hit from the
Yugoslav air defenses at the beginning of May.  Previously, NATO has blamed
the crash on technical failure.

<P>
In the afternoon, the Alliance presented its conclusions on the latest wave
of air strikes.  Tanks, artillery, and grenade launchers in Kosovo were the
preferred targets of NATO combat aircraft.  Attacks against the Serbian air
force have increased throughout Yugoslavia.  According to Mr. Oberst, a NATO
spokesperson, one third of the 245 airstrikes on Friday alone were used to
take out ground-to-air missile installations and radar warning systems.

<P>
In addition, during the most intensive airstrikes since the beginning of the
war, power plants and transformer stations have been hit.  For the second
time in just a few days, the penitentiary in Istock also became one of the
targets.  Yugoslavia has alleged that NATO killed several prisoners during
the bombings.  NATO is prepared to acknowledge only two fatalities and claims
that the building is no longer being used as a prison.  Formerly, the site
was used as an interrogation point for Albanian detainees.  Since then,
divisions of the Serbian army and the special police now work in the
building.  NATO asserts that there was an airport in close proximity to the
building which served as the launch site for operations in Kosovo.

</H1>
The preparations for tomorrow's election for federal president in Berlin are
in full swing.  A clear favorite is the former Minister President of North
Rhine-Westphalia, Johannes Rau.  He has been nominated by the SPD to be
elected the eighth federal president.  Rau should be elected in the third
round of voting at the latest, as only a simple majority of votes is required
in this phase to elect.

Whitsun meeting of Sudeten Germans
</H1>
Sudeten Germans got the support they had hoped for from the state government
of Bavaria at the 50th Whitsun meeting in Nuremberg.  Minister President
Stoiber opened the traditional Sudeten German Day event for which the
organizers expected some 100,000 attendees.  In his speech, Stoiber took the
federal government to task for clearly distancing itself from the Sudeten
Germans' demands to the Czech Republic.

<P>
Federal Chancellor Schroeder has been quoted as telling the Czech Minister
President Zemann that the deportation of the Sudeten Germans after World War
II was a closed chapter of history.  He continued that the German federal
government will not submit any demands for reparations.  The Bavarian
Minister President interpreted this stance as a definite change in Germany's
political policy in comparison to previous administrations.  Stoiber
characterized the chancellor's words as a commentary indicating an ignorance
of history and added that one could not simply make a clean break from the
past.  The principles asserting the rights of the Kosovar Albanians should
also be justly applied to the Sudeten Germans, he added.

Federal government to limit number of doctors' practices

have been placed on the maximum number of doctors allowed to set up a
practice.  The existing practices, according to the SPD deputy faction
leader, will not be affected.  Mr. Dressler estimated the number of doctors'
practices in Germany at 112,000.  25 years ago, there were only 36,000.
