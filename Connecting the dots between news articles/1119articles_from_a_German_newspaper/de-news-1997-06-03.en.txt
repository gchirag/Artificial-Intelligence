Agreement on disputed gold revaluation
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel and President of the German
central bank (Bundesbank) Hans Tietmeyer have agreed on a compromise
about the disputed revaluation of Bundesbank's gold and foreign currency
reserves. After a meeting in Bonn of the CDU/CSU faction in the Bundestag
(lower house of parliament) Mr Waigel said a good compromise has been
made. Bundesbank's board of directors (Zentralbankrat) still has to
approve the deal. The revaluation of the gold and foreign
currency reserves will be done gradually beginning with this year's
balance sheet.

<P>
CDU/CSU faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said the proposal has been
welcomed within the CDU and the CSU. The dispute between the CDU/CSU
and the FDP about this year's budget and tax rates has not been settled
though. Faction and party leaders discussed the issue again in the
Chancellor's Office this morning. The FDP stressed again that they
reject tax increases to plug gaps in the deficit. In the afternoon,
the factions of all three parties in the Bundestag discussed budget
policies.

Different opinions on criteria for monetary union
</H1>
The German central bank (Bundesbank) does not take for granted
the anticipated starting date for the European monetary union. It turned
out that for some countries, including Germany, the criteria set for
joining the common currency are harder to fulfil than assumed only a little
while ago, said the member of Bundesbank's board of directors,
Mr Meister (sp?). He warned against "creative accounting" measures that
do not have any positive real consequences. The criteria for joining the
monetary union had to be applied strictly. The time pressure of the
anticipated date January 1, 1999 should not lead to neglect of the
stability of the Euro [the future European currency].

<P>
On the other hand, the Federation of German banks warned against the
possibility of the European monetary union being canceled due to a too
strict interpretation of the stability criteria. The managing director,
Mr Weber, said it would be disastrous if the Euro failed because of a
German budget deficit of 3.2 per cent. Mr Weber added that the Federal
government could not ignore the necessity of further cuts, for example
in the social services sector, and of further privatisations [of state
owned companies].

BfA employees demonstrate for keeping their agency open
</H1>
8,500 emloyees of the Federal Pension Plan Agency for
Employees (Bundesversicherungsanstalt fuer Angestellte - BfA)
demonstrated in Berlin for keeping their agency operating. They
have also demanded that the BfA remain in the German capital.
The protest is aimed against a decision of the Bundesrat (upper
house of parliament) to transfer the responsibilities of
the agency to the individual German states. Unions fear the loss of
13,000 jobs. They are asking the Bundestag (lower house of
parliament) and the federal government to reject the
decision of the Bundesrat.

Bargaining in chemical sector reaches deadlock
</H1>
Negotiations on reforming the industry-wide collective
bargaining agreement in the West German chemical sector seems to
have reached a deadlock. A union spokesperson said in Hanover that
the employers' group had to consult their federation. Now,
any outcome was possible again, even an adjournment of the
negotiations. However, both sides agreed in principle on a
wage band within which the companies could lower wages in
times of bad business. The IG Chemie union wants to set a definit
lower limit to this band, though.

Better protection of bank customers in stock deals
</H1>
Bank customers have better protection now when
dealing with stocks. The Federal Office for Bank Supervision
published new guidelines today. According to these guidelines,
banks have to tell customers the risks of the different stock
market deals. Recommendations by banks that might turn out
disadvantageous for customers are forbidden. For the protection
of customers, so-called "front-running" has been out-lawed
as well. This means that banks are not allowed to buy stocks
before recommending it or before fulfilling an order of a
customer.

The musician Mr Reinke (sp?) has apologised for his
anti-Semitic behaviour in Israel. In a personal statement the
musician said he is deeply ashamed of his uncontrolled behaviour.
He regretted having offended the Israeli people and having put a
strain on the relations between Germany and Israel.

<P>
During a tour in Israel of the Deutsche Oper operatic company,
Mr Reinke had signed a hotel bill last Friday using the name of
Adolf Hitler. He had drunk so much alcohol that evening that he
was not able to recall his actions in detail, the musician stressed.
