Mr Hoeppner won't rule out further coalition-talks with the CDU
</H1>
Saxony-Anhalt's premier Hoeppner would not rule out
further talks with the CDU party about forming a coalition
government. Last night, when interviewed by German state television
ARD, he said that the CDU had to be willing to co-operate with all
the other parties in parliament in the battle against the right-wing
German People's Party (DVU). Yesterday talks between the SPD and the CDU
came to an end shortly after they had started. The CDU had been against
the SPD's idea to co-operate with the PDS when fighting the DVU. The PDS
re-iterated that they would tolerate an SPD-led minority government -
without any preconditions.

Unemployment remains at a record high: according to the Federal
Labour Office, there were 4.2 million registered unemployed in April 1998
- up almost 74,000 compared to last year, albeit about 200,000 less than
last month. The rate of unemployment now stands at 11.4%. In numerous
cities 10,000s took to the streets to draw the general public's attention
to their plight.

Referendum fails
</H1>
The first nationwide referendum supporting the labelling of
genetically-engineered foodstuffs has failed. During the past two weeks
only about half of the required number of signatures had been
collected in Bavaria. More than 50 different groups had initiated the
referendum. Bavaria's CSU passed a law covering the same issue, which,
according to the opposition, did not have enough bite.

20,066 petitions for parliament
</H1>
The number of petitions received by parliament (Bundestag) went up by
about 12% in 1997, compared to last year, bringing it to 20,066. Main
bones of contention had been pension and social policy issues. Almost
40% of the petitions were handled by the Ministry of Labour.

<P>
The Ministry of Health's share increased, too, mainly due to severe cuts
in the health sector.

Mr Mayer-Vorfelder put on the spot
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg's finance minister Mayer-Vorfelder has
come under increasing pressure when it was leaked that he had taken money
for holding a speech at the LBank. The SPD asked premier Teufel to dismiss
him. The Greens stated that this minister was not acceptable. Tonight
Mr Mayer-Vorfelder declared that he had subsequently donated the fee -
5000 marks - to a hospital. Premier Teufel was critical of the matter
and said he did not think it was appropriate for ministers who were members
of a state supervisory board to take money for speeches.That's what he
had told Mr Mayer-Vorfelder. He would make sure it would not happen again.
