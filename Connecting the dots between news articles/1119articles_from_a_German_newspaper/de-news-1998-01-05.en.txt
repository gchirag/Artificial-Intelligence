</H1>

year 1998 with confidence. But on Bavarian Radio he also cautioned the

expects as the outcome of the Liberals' Epiphany meeting in Stuttgart a
signal of unity.

Hoehn and Clement support continuation of red-green coalition
</H1>
North-Rhine Westphalia's Interior Minister Baerbel Hoehn came out in favour
of a continuation of the red-green coalition. The Green politician said
that it was possible and useful to continue the government alliance despite
the argument about the open-cast lignite mine Garzweiler 2. As yet,
however, it is unclear whether the special party conference of the
Alliance/Greens in a fortnight will follow her recommendations. 
In the meantime, Minister of Economics Clement (SPD), declared his support
for the red-green coalition. The outline plan for the production of the
open-cast lignite mine Garzweiler 2 was approved just before Christmas; it
has since led to the most severe government crisis in North Rhine
Westphalia.
