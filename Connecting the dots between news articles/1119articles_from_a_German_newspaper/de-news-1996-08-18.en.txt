Kohl comments on Taxes and Chechnya
</H1>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl called the reducing of tax burdens the most
important goal of the planned large scale tax reform. Interviewed by ZDF
TV, he said  the goal was mandated by the individual citizens' interests
and the desire to stimulate the economy. Kohl also called for an end to the
discussion about the timetable and financing of the reform and criticized
the coalition partner FDP.
Kohl explained that the Liberals (FDP) had not made a single suggestion
how to realize their  demands for the enactment of the reform by 1998
already.
<P>
Kohl called on Russian President Yeltsin to find a way to end the war in
Chechnya. The Chancellor said he would call Yeltsin upon his return from
vacationing, the middle of the month. Kohl expressed his sympathies for the
endeavours through negotiations by Russian security advisor Lebed.
<P>
Kohl didn't comment on him possibly running for Chancellor again in the
1998 elections. He assumed that SPD and Greens would join with the PDS to
replace the governing coalition. The CDU should try to win over potential
PDS voters.

Protestant church commemorates Oskar Bruesewitz
</H1>
The Protestant church of Sachsen today commemorated Oskar Bruesewitz, a priest
in the former DDR who 20 years ago burnt himself to death. Bishop Dehmke said
that this act of desperation was on one hand a indictment of the repressive
system of the DDR [the former East Germany] and on the other hand criticism
of a church that supposedly had tied itself too closely to the State.
Out of protest against the political conditions in the DDR, Bruesewitz on
August 18, 1976 had poured gasoline over his body and set himself on fire
in front of the church in Zeitz.
