German-French summit meeting ends without an agreement
</H1>
Germany and France agreed that they still disagreed - after meeting at
Poitiers to discuss their viewpoints regarding the compact for stability (for
the future common European currency). France's PM Chirac stated that both
countries' opinions did not differ all that much. Germany's Chancellor Kohl
emphasised that he was certain both sides would be able to solve issues that
had not been solved so far. At the same time he said that Germany would not
agree to amendments to the compact for stability. France's premier Jospin had
asked for an addendum covering measures against unemployment. Mr Kohl also
said that they would continue negotiations right through the weekend. The
Netherlands had come up with a compromise that should also please France: the
paper, which was leaked in Brussels, provided for closer co-operation as far
as employment policies were concerned, yet at the same time backed Germany's
stance, viz. that it was primarily the member states' responsibility to
create jobs.

State finance ministers: Germany not yet ready for European Currency Union
</H1>
Germany's state ministers of finance are not too sure about Germany becoming
a member of the new common European currency. After their conference in
Bad Homburg, they were afraid Germany might not meet the criteria. Excessive
deficits and additional debt are on the cards for 1997 and 1998. The state
ministers mainly criticised how federal finance minister Waigel handled
things: privatisations would only provide a short-term stop-gap measure to
fight budget-deficits. Continued cost-cutting/saving money would be a
long-term fix, and tax-exemptions/subsidies would have to go as well. They
also pleaded for lowering Germany's contributions to the European Community,
which they thought were too high.

Two days' vocational training/week here to stay
</H1>
The state ministers meeting at Norderney wanted to stick to two days
vocational training/week, contrary to what business wanted, according to
Hesses's minister Holzapfel. One day less would lower standards, and
besides, the current 12 hours training/week would not fit into one day.
Federal science and technology minister Ruettgers criticised the decision
and blamed the SPD for leaving apprentices out in the cold. "If you are
against restructuring vocational training, which would help business, you'll
make sure there won't be additional apprenticeships." State and federal
heads of state will discuss the issue at the beginning of July.

Right-wing radicals sentenced
</H1>
About a year after they had attacked some youths from Kleve, four young men
from Mecklenburg/Western Pomerania were sentenced by the Schwerin Regional
Court. The Juvenile Court sentenced the 22-year old main defendant to
2 year's jail, for aggravated sedition and causing bodily harm. His three
mates got suspended youth sentences from 3 months to a year, a fifth
defendant was acquitted. Last year the alleged right-wing radicals took to
a group of young people camping near the Plauen Lakes with baseball bats and
clubs, injuring the people looking after the youths.

EU and USA agree to recognise each other's industrial standards
</H1>
EU and USA agreed to recognising each other's product standards, consequently
doing away with any technical checks on imports, according to a
EU-spokesperson. This would cover goods to the tune of almost 70 billion
marks, mainly in the telecommunication, pharmaceutical and electrical
appliance sectors. The agreement provides, amongst other things, that EU
safety-tests would also be good for the USA.

For the first time a lay assessor gets sentenced to jail
</H1>
This was the first time a lay assessor got sentenced to 3 years'jail, for
corruption. The Tiergarten Regional Court stated the sentence had to be a
deterrent, as the defendant has willingly broken one of the tenets
of a state based on law and order: the independence of judges. The court
was convinced the 51-year old real estate salesperson had asked for 100,000
marks to 'tweak' trials.
