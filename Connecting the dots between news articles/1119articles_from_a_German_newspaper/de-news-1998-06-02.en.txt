Crisis meeting about measures to increase safety of nuclear transports
</H1>
Federal Environment Minister Angela Merkel has met with her state
colleagues to discuss a ten-point programme to increase the safety of
nuclear waste transports. The measures are to prevent that safety
thresholds are passed during CASTOR transports. Several states led by an
SPD government did not send their subject ministers but high-ranking
officials.
Environment Minister Juettner of Lower-Saxony explained that all conditions
for a decision were lacking for a talk with Ms. Merkel. The Hesse Minister
Hinz said she was going to have explored whether utility company RWE has
knowingly violated radiation protection by-laws.
When the crisis meeting closed last night no new measures had been adopted.
Federal Environment Minister Merkel stressed that further steps would only
be initiated after a report by the states. The report is due in two weeks.
The environment ministers of several states announced at the meeting to
present measuring protocols about the nuclear transports of the past years.
Ms. Merkel declared that there was no evidence for doubts against the
reliability of nuclear power companies.

measures in reaction to the affair about radioactive contaminated
transportation casks. In a five-page-letter the nuclear power companies
presented the Federal Environment Minister with detailed suggestions. Their
aim is a greater transparency of the transports. Therefore, the information
policy was to be improved.
The department for reactor safety at the federal environment ministry said
the suggestions were probably insufficient.

Strikes in retail sector
</H1>
The retail sector in western Germany is heading towards a strike after
several collective bargaining rounds without results. The executive of the
DAG union resolved today that a ballot for a strike be held in five states.
The regional bargainings in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Saarland have also been
tabled without result. In the Southwest the employees of four companies
went on strike. The ballots started in North Rhine-Westphalia. In Hesse,
Schleswig-Holstein and Saarland the workers will vote on a strike later
this week.
The DAG and HBV unions consider the employers' offer of 1.5% wage increase
insufficient. The unions also reject the demand to pay contracted
unemployed workers lower wages.

Nazis financed World War II with victims' gold
</H1>
Apparently, the Nazis have used the gold of their victims at a larger
extent than known so far to finance World War II. The precious metal was
usually exchanged for money in Switzerland to buy important raw materials
and supplies in other countries. This is the conclusion of a report by the
US Foreign Ministry. It says that gold, then worth $300 million, was paid
to Sweden, Portugal, Spain, Argentina, and Turkey. Three quarters of the
money was passed through the Swiss National Bank.
