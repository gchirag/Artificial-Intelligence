Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council founded
</H1>
Sintra near Lisbon/Portugal. NATO plus 27 European countries forged a new
base for closer political and military co-operation. Coinciding with the
end of the spring-session of the NATO-foreign ministers in Portugal, they
founded the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council. NATO as well as
Central- and East-European countries, plus some neutral states, became
members of this new body, taking over from the existing NATO Council for
Co-operation. Its mission is co-operation as far as peace-missions, arms
control and creating good-will are concerned. The NATO-foreign ministers
also talked about Bosnia, threatening the former warring factions with
sanctions once again, in case they dragged their feet while putting the
Dayton Accord into practice and rebuilding the civil sector of their
countries.

Government insists on re-valuating Bundesbank's gold-reserves
</H1>
Government wants to raise the valuation of the Bundesbank's
gold-reserves, regardless of criticism by the Bank and the opposition
parties. CDU General Secretary Hintze said that doing so made political and
economical sense. Spokes-person Hausmann emphasised that re-valuation would
not be used to plug budget-deficits, and would not mean an attack on the
Bundesbank's impartiality. There are some who disagree with Finance Minister
Waigel, also within government's ranks. Mr Waigel refuted claims by the
opposition parties calling for his resignation. The Federation of German
Industry (BDI) warned against hurting the economy if government and
Bundesbank did not come to an agreement fast, and the Federation of German
Banks seconded that: re-valuation was no fix for budget problems.

Plenty of reactions to President Herzog's speech
</H1>
According to the Federal President Herzog's office, reactions to his
so-called Berlin-speech had been beyond expectations. He had received more
than 4,000 letters, mainly in support of him, and 26,000 users had accessed
his speech on the Internet. And Mr Herzog wanted to keep the flame of debate
alive by staging various activities. In his speech, delivered at Berlin's
Hotel Adlon, he had lashed out against Germans standing still and losing
courage, and asked for more innovation.

former Berlin Wall). The court heard evidence from 12 cases where people
trying to leave the GDR were shot or killed by land-mines. The state
prosecutor claimed that the four generals had supported the then regime
by taking an active part in the respective government-committee.

GP's have to keep patients better informed about their treatment
</H1>
General practitioners will have to try harder to inform patients
about their treatment, in an understandable and adequate manner, according
to a revised charter just passed by the Federation of German Practitioners.
And they also have to respect a patient's wish to have a second opinion. The
law against advertising now has become a bit less stringent: they will be
allowed to publish data regarding their qualifications on public networks,
e.g. the Internet. And they may also give hints as far as opening hours of
surgeries, public transport and car-parking are concerned. Full-blown
commercial advertising, however, remains banned.
