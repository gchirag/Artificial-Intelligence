Tax payers association publicizes tax squandering
</H1>
The Tax Payers Association has publicized 118 cases of tax
squandering last year in its latest black-book. The president of the
association, Mr. Baeke, said that never before have there been as many
cases. One community in Suabia, for example, has bought toy fish for
5000 DM for a pond. A multi-storey car park in Boppard,
Rhineland-Palatinate, constructed for 4 million DM is standing empty.
In total, 1.2 billion DM taxes have been wasted. The Tax Payers
Association estimates that, additionally, 60 billion DM evaporate
annually in murky channels and due to bad planning. The association
demands that tax squandering be investigated and punished similar to
tax evasion.

</H1>
The coalition committee of Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Gruene has
agreed on an energy policy. The coalition will try to find a compromise
with the utility companies by the end of this year to phase out nuclear
energy. If no compromise has been found by then, the government will
legislate the withdrawal from nuclear energy, said the leader of the
Green faction, Rezzo Schlauch. Today, the presidents of the utility
companies will meet with Economics Minister Werner Mueller. An ad-hoc
coalition committee has been charged to investigate how municipal
utilities can be supported to face market competition. This will be the
topic of today's meeting of government politicians and public services
and transportation union OeTV's head Herbert Mai. It is clear already
that gas and steam generated power will be exempt from the eco-tax.

the 6.1 billion DM promised in subsidies, said executive leader of the
Green faction in the Bundestag Ursula Heinen on Suedwestfunk radio.
Neither would the federal government back more investments. Faction

Berlin-Brandenburg that there was no future for the Transrapid. SPD

Transrapid could already have been built without becoming more

Labour Minister Riester still against retirement at 60
</H1>
Federal Labour Minister Walter Riester is still opposing
retirement at age 60. He rejected the demand by union IG Metall to
draft such a bill by the end of November. Riester told the daily
Koelner Stadtanzeiger that retirement at age 60 could not be financed.
Deputy-president of German Federation of Unions (DGB) Ursula
Engelen-Kefer accused Riester of not collaborating with the unions on
the pension reform. The unions rejected Riester's plan to increase
pensions for two years only in line with the average price increase
index. Instead, the unions want to keep pensions tied to the general
wage increase but take into account tax reliefs for employees and the
higher child benefit.

many workers as possible to retire at 60, however, with less pension.
