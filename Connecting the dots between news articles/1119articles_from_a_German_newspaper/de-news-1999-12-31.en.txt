The Chancellor's New Year's Eve address
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder asked for more commitment in the year to come.
Citizens crossing the threshold of the 21st century should look after
their own future, and take more responsibility for themselves, according
to
the Chancellor's New Year's Eve address. "This is the first time in our
history that we Germans have the chance to begin a new century in a
country
that's united in peace and freedom. We are facing brilliant prospects of
building a future of prosperity and freedom for all Europeans. Let us all
make good use of this opportunity. I wish you all the best for the
year 2000."

Bavaria's Premier Stoiber appealed to Bavarians to be more human, when
addressing them on New Year's Eve. In a global world with world-wide
communications, such as the Internet, emotional ties with neighbours or
even
family-members were at risk.

CDU: even more anonymous donations
</H1>
Apparently the CDU-party received even more anonymous donations
than
former head of the party Kohl has admitted so far. The amended
audit-report
covering the years 1992 to 1998 lists 2.4 million marks in donations that
had not been mentioned in the original report. Mr Kohl so far had only
admitted that he had pocketed up to 2 million marks in donations, which he
had not declared as such. Meanwhile the party has earmarked reserves of
7.2 million marks, just in case. Now the Public Prosecutor in Bonn is able
to start official investigations of Mr Kohl: an hour ago, the deadline for
complaints against stripping Mr Kohl of his parliamentary immunity has
expired.

Federal Year-2000 Task convenes
</H1>
The Year-2000 Taskforce got together in Berlin. Their job is to compare
how
the changeover to the new millennium works in other industrialised
countries,
such as Japan. If they were okay, Germany supposedly would be fine, too,
according to a spokesperson interviewed on radio SUEDWESTFUNK.

New Zealand apparently did not have any Year-2000 related
computer-glitches.
A few minutes after midnight, there were no reports of power-/water-supply
cuts or other problems. New Zealand was the role-model for other
countries,
as she was the first to see in the new year. The
country had set up a taskforce in the capital of Wellington to collate
reports of eventual computer-glitches.
