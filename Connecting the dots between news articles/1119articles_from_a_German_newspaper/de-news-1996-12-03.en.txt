Further defeat for Volkswagen AG
</H1>
In the legal dispute against automobile group General Motors,
Volkswagen AG has to put up with another defeat. A federal court
in Detroit rejected protests by VW. The Judge allowed General Motors to sue
Volkswagen and some of their top executives for violation of copyright
and competition laws. Thus, the pending civil proceedings by GM against
industrial espionage by Jose Ignacio Lopez can continue. Mr Lopez, who
resigned last Friday from his post as chief purchasing executive at
Volkswagen, allegedly stole company secrets when he changed from GM to VW.
A week ago, the Judge decided to allow claims under the so-called
Rico bill that allows for claims of up to three times of the actual
damages. According to speculations in the US press, these damages reach
claims from several hundred millions up to five billions of dollars.

Protests against health care reform in Bonn
</H1>
More than 25,000 people demonstrated in Bonn today against the
new laws to reform the health care system. The Federation of
Physiotherapists called for the demonstration. They particularly
protested against plans of the federal government to exempt public health
insurers from paying for home nursing, rehabilitation treatments and
medicaments. According to these plans, insurers could still reimburse
the costs of these services, but they would be no longer obliged to do so.

<P>
Some 30 organisations, including DGB and DAG unions and the
Arbeiterwohlfahrt (worker's welfare) organisation, have formed a wide
alliance against the health care reform. It criticised that the
government's reform plans neither reformed the health care system nor
put a hold on health care spending in the long run. The plans would result
in a two class medical system and the desolidarisation of society
at the disadvantage of the old, the disabled and the chronicly ill. Those
who do not have enough money to pay, e.g., massages, will do without but
will not become healthier this way. In many cases, health insurers will
have to pay more for later treatments.
<P>
Mr. Seehofer's plans also threaten tens of thousands of jobs since many
of today's 25,000 physiotherapists will no longer work profitably after the
implementation of the new laws.
<P>
Tomorrow, Bundestag's health committee will look into the matter.

Revenue offices to check on people with high incomes
</H1>
German revenue offices will inspect more closely tax returns
of top earners to fight tax evasion, according to Hannoversche Allgemeine
newspaper. The paper reports today that on 1 January, corresponding
regulations take effect in all German federal states. Then, at least
70% of all tax returns declaring an income of Dm400,000 or more will be
inspected very carefully. If the declared income is only above
Dm300,000, a computer will randomly choose 40-70% of all returns for
further inspection. In addition, at least 70% of returns declaring losses
of more than Dm200,000 will also be subject to further checks.

German-Czech reconciliation declaration still this year
</H1>
Germany and the Czech Republic plan to have the long-planned
reconciliation declaration ready to be signed by the end of the year. After
a meeting with Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus, German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said negotiators needed to meet once more. Mr Kohl confirmed
he will talk to the Association of Sudetes-Germans [Germans who, before
World War II, lived in Sudetenland, now part of the Czech Republic]
who have so far blocked the statement. The Chancellor also announced he
has accepted an invitation to visit Prague next year.

<P>
According to Mr Klaus, both politicians have agreed on all statements of the
German-Czech reconciliation declaration. After the meeting at the OSCE
summit in Lisbon, Mr Klaus said what is left to do in the last round of
negotiations is to put those agreed-on phrases on paper. He added,
"The declaration is practically finished".
Nonetheless, Mr Klaus did not want to give a particular date when the
treaty will be paraphed by the Foreign ministers and then signed by
the Heads of both governments.

DAG union prefers securing jobs to pay rises
</H1>
The aim of employees union DAG in the 1997 bargaining round is
to maintain the real income of their members. According to DAG head,
Mr Issen, the union renounces pay rises to secure existing jobs and possibly
create new jobs. The key question in the oncoming bargaining
round will be to maintain full sick pay. The DAG union and their members
will not accept a sick pay cut without fighting.

<P>
For the first time in its history, the DAG union does not demand a
particular pay rise at the beginning of the bargaining round. The expected
inflation rate of 1.75% will be the lowest acceptable pay rise, though.

AOK Bavaria to increase health insurance contributions
</H1>
Public health insurer AOK Bavaria increases its contributions
by 0.5 percentage points to 13.7% starting January 1997. This was confirmed
officially today by Chairman of the Board of Directors of AOK Bavaria
Klaus Dittrich. Also, patients will also have to pay more for prescriptions.
In total, both, employers and employees, will have to pay an additional
Dm290mio.
<P>
Mr Dittrich said the increase was necessary because of low revenues from
contributions and a high rate of unemployment among the persons insured
at AOK Bavaria. He blamed government failures for the increase.
When the third step of the health care reform comes into effect,
AOK members will have to pay more again. Instead of four marks
per prescribed medicine, they will have to pay nine marks. Extra fees
for stays in hospitals will rise from Dm12 to Dm17 per day, and for
rehabilitation treatments to Dm30 per day.
<P>
AOK Baden-Wuerttemberg, in contrast, decreases their contributions with effect
from January 1997 by 0.4 percentage points to 13% of the gross income.

Media union against information drawn from the Internet
</H1>
Unverified use of sources pulled off the Internet threatens the
quality of journalistic reports, according to media union IG Medien.
Representatives of the union said at a journalists conference at Cologne,
information drawn from the Internet can rarely be verified. Therefore
readers, radio listeners and TV viewers can no longer rely on getting
well investigated reports. Head of radio and TV station WDR, Mr Pleitgen
criticised a "computer journalism" that neglects the investigation of a
story on site.

SPD-Laender against university tuition fees
</H1>
The federal states governed by the SPD want to stop university tution
fees with a new law. They call for a uniform solution: up to now, each German
federal state can decide for itself whether to introduce tuition fees, as did
for example the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg. SPD educational expert and
Rhineland-Palatinate's Minister for Science, Mr Zoellner, said the SPD
wants that undergraduate studies remain tuition free. He also rejected
fees for long-time students.

Standard of living in the East still lower
</H1>
The standard of living in East Germany will take at least another
10 to 15 years to reach the same level as in the West, thinks Federal
Minister of Economics Guenter Rexrodt. Mr Rexrodt said today in Berlin
the growth in the eastern states has become much weaker. Only 2% growth
have been predicted for this year. The subsidies for East Germany have
therefore to remain on a high level.

Hesse's Minister of Justice remains in office
</H1>
Hesse's Minister of Justice Rupert von Plottnitz remains in
office. The factions of CDU and FDP did not succeed with their motion to
fire him.

<P>
The state parliament, however, passed a motion stating Mr Henrichs has
severely damaged the reputation of the law authorities; he must ask himself
whether he can remain president of Frankfurt's Regional Court under these
circumstances. Mr Henrichs received Dm1.3mio in fees for an expert opinion.
He already resigned from his post as President of Hesse's Supreme Court,
but he wants to remain President of the Regional Court.
