Trittin vs Schroeder dispute on nuclear energy commissions
</H1>
Federal Minister for the Environment, Mr Trittin, sticks to his
plans to abolish two federal  nuclear energy commissions, even after
having been criticised by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The aim of his
action was to create a greater diversity of opinions in these commissions,
said Mr Trittin in a press conference this evening. The minister stressed
that even in the future, these [similar, newly founded commissions will
have members that might be trusted by the nuclear power stations' operators.
Mr Schroeder had criticised that Mr Trittin had started the firing of the
existing members of the two commissions as well as the hiring of new members
with effect of January 1999, without priorly informing the Chancellor's
office. In Mr Schroeder's opinion, Mr Trittin action threaten the talks
with power plant operators [to shut down all nuclear power stations
eventually, thus as well endangering the coalition.

New blackmail for German Rail threatening bombing attacks
</H1>
The train station of the Hanse city [Luebeck] had to be closed
down again tonight for some time because German Rail had again been
warned about hidden bombs in the station. Transportation police, however,
did not find any explosives. According to a German Rail press release this
blackmailing could have been committed by people riding on the current
wave of attacks against the company - there had been several such related
incidents recently. On the very busy line Hanover-Lehrte the rail traffic
come to a standstill for a few hours after a person had called and said
that "something will happen". The cases of some attacks against rail lines
between Dessau and Bitterfeld have been solved, however. Transportation
police have arrested 13 youths aged 13 to 17 years as suspects. The young
people have confessed to have put metal and wooden obstacles on the tracks.
In several trains emergency brakes were used because of the obstacles,
though nobody was injured. A connection to the group "Friends of the
railway", however, was dismissed. "The friends of the railway" had taken
responsible for several attacks in the past days.
