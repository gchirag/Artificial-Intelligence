Greens hold party conference in Kassel
</H1>
 The Alliance 90/Green Party federal party conference in Kassel
ended today.  The main focus of today's discussion was concerned with
educational politics. Delegates were asked to discuss a concept of reform
which focuses on more self-determination for schools and colleges.
According to this concept, the different types of schools will be become
more open over a period of time. They proposed that school-leavers should
no longer be permitted to graduate after the ninth year of school, but
that a more standardized school-leaving certificate after the tenth grade
should be introduced instead.  This concept provides more opportunity for
adults to further their education. In addition, the Greens wants
increased self-determination for educational institutions.  A large
majority at the Congress yesterday also supported initiating a system of
basic social security to replace current welfare and unemployment
payments.

Comments on Green federal party conference
</H1>
The Greens see their party conference in Kassel today as important in
setting the course for a change in government next year.  According to
party spokeswoman Mrs. Ruestel, the Greens are expecting a change of
government  next year.  She stated at the end of the conference that the
Greens were the only party which had proposed concepts in the areas of
employment,  environment, and reorganization of social support system.
Together with faction chairman Joschka Fischer, she called upon the 700
delegates to concentrate on ousting the Bonn coalition.  Federal general
manager Mrs. Ruehle said on the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station that the
Greens are steering towards the election year with solidly thoughtthrough models.  This would enable changing from a system of welfare to a
system of basic security, which could be financed by reintroducing
property tax.  CDU General Secretary Hintze criticized the Greens saying
that they should not place too much stress on the social and welfare
system.  His colleague in the CSU, Mr. Protzner, said that delegates at
the conference in Kassel had once again proposed a federal, dirigiste
system hostile towards achievement.

Internal arguments responsible for stalling reform in Germany
</H1>
The State Premier of Hessen, Mr. Eichel, has blamed the stalling of
reform in Germany on differing opinions within the governing coalition.
The SPD politician said that the government acts as if it wants to talk
to the Social Democrats about all the problems.  At the same time,
however, it isn't clear what its own desires are.  Mr. Eichel emphasized
that these are clear signs of differences between Union and FDP.  Even
the SPD cannot reach an agreement with a quarreling government coalition.
The government could not reproach the Social Democrats on conducting a
blockade policy under these circumstances.

Bluem opposes basic pension financed by taxes
</H1>
The Federal Minister of Employment, Norbert Bluem, has once again
rejected the proposal of a basic pension financed by taxes.  The CDU
politician criticized advocates of this plan of making incorrect
calculations of what such a system would cost.  Mr. Bluem emphasized that
the younger generation in particular would be burdened by a basic pension
system.  They would have to continue paying the dues for today's
retirees, finance their own pension via taxes and, in addition, also pay
for private insurance. In connection with the pension reform, Mr. Bluem
also rejected the idea of looking to other sources other than the pension
fund for funding extraneous pension benefits.  He said that the pension
insurance fund would lose its character of solidarity when one only
considered the problem from a bookkeeping point of view.  SPD chairman
Oskar Lafontaine said that this was a great misuse of the pension plan
and that expenses which were not financed by contributions should be paid
from tax revenues.  Mr. Lafontaine along with other coalition
politicians, said that the planned increase of pension contributions to
21 percent must be prevented.  However he could not make new suggestions
on a compromise in the matter.

FDP proposal on military draft rejected
</H1>

draft as it did not receive the support of a minimum of one third of the
70,000 delegates.   Mr. Gehrhard, the FDP chairman, confirmed the result
in Viersen. The result of the vote will be published tomorrow.  For now
it will be only a non-obligatory suggestion and will not bind the FDP
leaders to a policy in the question of the military draft versus an army
of volunteers.
