Bonn hopes for less tensions in Indonesia
</H1>
For the first time federal government voiced concerns about the
continuing violence in Indonesia. Spokesperson Schmueling said that
they hoped that President Suharto's early return home would defuse
tensions. Mr Suharto, however, announced in the meantime that he would
reverse part of the austerity measures designed to fight the economic
crisis. Price rises of between 70 to 100 percent had triggered riots
and looting. Up to 100 persons were killed so far, and some sources
claim that Jakarta on its own had suffered 250 casualties.

Mr Kohl defends remodelling of social net
</H1>
VdK president Hirlinger accused federal government of demolishing the
social structures in Germany. The VdK is an interest group for mainly
elderly and disabled persons, and a strong advocate for maintaining
pensions at their current level.

<P>
Mr Hirlinger was very critical of government's health reforms, and also
asked for amendments as far as the pension reforms were concerned.
The Chancellor would have nothing of it: Pensions will not be cut,
said Mr Kohl, but according to our expectations they will only rise at
a smaller rate - due to demographic trends in the future. Mr Kohl also
said that the SPD's statement that they would cancel part of government's
reforms was unrealistic. Previously head of the SPF Lafontaine had
announced at a VdK congress that his party would can the pension reform.

CDU: police will cast net wide covering all of Germany
</H1>
The CDU announced that police would soon cast their net wide when
looking for criminals (so called Schleierfahndung, where Schleier
stands for veil). So far police may only do random checks on persons
(who don't have to be suspects) in a few states such as Bavaria. These
random checks will then also cover all airports, train stations and
trains. The coalition government intends to pass a law to that effect
even before the upcoming elections.
