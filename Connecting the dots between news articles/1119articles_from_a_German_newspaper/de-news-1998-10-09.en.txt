Messrs Schroeder and Fischer go to Washington
</H1>
The Kosovo conflict is also on the agenda when the chancellor-elect,
Mr Schroeder, is visiting Washington. His designated Foreign Minister,
Mr Fischer, who is travelling with him, emphasised that he supported a firm
stand as far as Serbia's PM's actions were concerned. The coalition
partners, however, disagree about the finer points of possibly deploying
the German Armed Forces - especially about the question if this required a
UN-mandate or not. The two Germans arrived in Washington at 3:00 am (CEDT),
and had their first meeting at 4 pm with the president of the World Bank,
Mr James Wolfensohn; they then went to the White House at 6 pm and had a
a working lunch with President Bill Clinton later on.

<P>
Americans are on tenterhooks about how the future Foreign Minister-designate
will handle the situation in Kosovo and the threat of planned NATO
airstrikes. Many Greens are quite critical about the missing UN-mandate for
them. This would be Mr Fischer's first test, and the same for the Americans
who will then pass judgement on how serious the SPD's declarations about
the consistency of Germany's foreign policies are to be taken in view of
their junior (coalition) partner.

<P>
This visit is to be seen as a demonstration that the new government will keep
doing what the outgoing one did.

Mr Stoiber warns against ecological tax
</H1>
Bavaria's Premier Stoiber voiced strong warnings against plans by the SPD
and the Greens parties to introduce an ecological tax. A hefty rise of
motor-spirits excise duty (or tax) would have a heavy impact on car sales
and boost unemployment, as Mr Stoiber stated at the beginning of Bavaria's
cabinet meeting behind closed doors at the monastery of Seeon.

PDS keeps claiming Deputy Speaker's job
</H1>
The PDS, who for the first time in their history got their own parliamentary
group in the federal Lower House (Bundestag) at the last elections, will
keep a close eye on government - from the opposition benches. Mr Gysi, head
of the PDS party, commented on the current negotiations between SPD and the
Greens. They will make sure promises are kept, and they also wanted to act
for all East Germans, according to Mr Gysi. He quoted two cases in point: the
re-introduction of a tax on assets and the planned magnetic levitation train.
Mr Gysi also made no bones about being against sending German troops to the
Kosovo region without a UN-mandate. He also commented on attempts to keep a
PDS-candidate for Deputy Speaker of the Lower House
(Bundestagsvizepraesidentin) from running: "Even if there were another CSU
candidate for the job, instead of our Petra Pless (sp?), I'm still convinced
that Ms Pless (sp?) would win. If she doesn't, we'll still claim the job.
Then there will be more polls, or we'll eventually take the matter to the
Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht).

<P>
Mr Gysi didn't want to comment any further on the current coalition-talks
between SPD and PDS in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. He only
recommended signing a treaty when enough agreement on factual items had been
reached.

36,000 young persons still without an apprenticeship
</H1>
Almost 36,000 young persons are still looking for apprenticeships, 4 weeks
after everyone else went back to school/training, but that's a lot less than
a year ago, according to the Federal Labour Agency
(Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit), ie. 25%. Trouble spots are the states in former
East Germany, as in the past, whereas the number of apprenticeships had gone
up in the West. There still are 23,000 unfilled apprenticeships. In total,
the number of vacancies stayed at the same level, while the number of
applicants went up.

<P>
Today the Employment Service began to offer apprenticeships on their
computers and on the Internet: www.arbeitsamt.de

SPD not to be swayed as far as price of petrol is concerned
</H1>
Federal manager of the SPD Muentefering said in an interview on TV that the
SPD would not buy into unacceptably large jumps in the price of petrol during
the current coalition talks. Hikes must not be too drastic.

German Soccer Association kicks off action against xenophobia
</H1>
The German Soccer Association proposed several measures to their members to
set a signal in the fight against xenophobia, the hate of foreigners/things
foreign. Articles in club newspapers or messages on display screens, for
example. Or they could add a paragraph about anti-racism to the stadiums'
by-laws.

Draw a pension once you hit 60?
</H1>
President of the Metal Workers' Union Zwickel asked for a general lowering of
the age when people can start to draw a pension, which would be part of the
Treaty for Work (Buendnis fuer Arbeit). This would mean that during the next
5 years approximately 3.4 million workers would quit and let the younger
generation have a go. How to pay for the lot? Mr Zwickel has already thought
about that one: contributions to the compulsory state-run pension-funds would
have to rise.

Mr Stoiber goes for balanced budget
</H1>
Bavaria's Premier Stoiber wants to come to grips with the problem of debt
during the next term of his government.

<P>
He re-iterated at a cabinet meeting at the monastery of Seeon that he would
keep a strict regime of saving money. New budgetary debt should gradually
become nil. He also spoke of halving allowances for ministers and freezing
them at that level.

Foreigners put their hopes on red-green coalition
</H1>
Foreigners' associations have approached Mr Schroeder's government with
concrete demands. They want dual-citizenship and a law against
discrimination. Member of parliament Oezdemir, Greens party, said in Bonn
that all existing laws would have to be checked if they contained any
discriminatory clauses. He could not understand, for example, that a
Turkish national would be unable to become a chimney-sweep in Germany.

Mobile telephone companies in regulator's gun
</H1>
Do D1 and D2 reign supreme in Germany's market for mobile telephone
services? That's what the regulator's office for postal services and
telecommunications is looking into now, meaning: they want to find out if
the subsidiaries of German Telekom and Mannesmann AG dominate the market. If
that was the case, they would have to get approval for any future change of
tariffs.
Mainly so-called service providers (who usually don't own a network) claimed
the two big players dominated the market, thus leaving less space for them.
