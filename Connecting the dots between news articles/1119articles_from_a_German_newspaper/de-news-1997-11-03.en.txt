</H1>
The commanding officers of the German armed forces (Bundeswehr) have
assembled for their regular meeting. One of the main topics on their
agenda is the improvement of the fight against right-wing extremism
within the Bundeswehr. Inspector General Hartmut Bagger said these crimes
were a disgrace for the army and that the soldiers involved in them would
be called into full account. Bagger went on to say that the mental and
moral waywardness of a few adolescents did not constitute a Bundeswehr
problem but a social one.

Wage negotiations in public service sector fail
</H1>
There will be no contract for employment in the public service sector. In
Stuttgart, early negotations on the securing of existing jobs failed.
Unions and employers were unable to move beyond their initial positions.
A major point of contention was the demand raised by federal, state, and
local employers to include sick pay and preventive health costs in the
negotiatons. OeTV and DAG unions refused to add these topics to the
agenda. They plan to decide on their official 1998 wage increase demand
in December. Both sides blamed each other for the failure of the talks.
