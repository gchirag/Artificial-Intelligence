Radio tax to increase by DM 3.33 next year
</H1>
The tax all Germans have to pay for listening to radio or looking at
TV
is to be increased to DM 31.58 a month. KEF, a committee for
calculating
financial needs for public broadcasting companies, recommends this
DM 3.33 increase starting in January 2001. Reasons are increasing
programming costs (e.g., movies and high-class sporting events).
ARD chairman and SWR director Voss, when questioned, said the
KEF recommendation would make for more safety in planning but was
painfully short of real needs. For public broadcasting companies,
the
pressure to economize and rationalize would be harder than ever.
