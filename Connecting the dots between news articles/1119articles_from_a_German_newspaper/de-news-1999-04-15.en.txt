Bundestag supports government's Kosovo-politics
</H1>
Three weeks after the beginning of NATO air attacks, the Bundestag still
supports military actions with great unanimity. Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said that Germany and its partners would fight for human rights,
freedom and democracy in Kosovo. The meeting between PDS-Chairman Gregor
Gysi and Yugoslav President Milisevic in Belgrade received harsh critisism.

<P>
Chancellor Schroeder emphasized that both EU and NATO wanted a political
solution. However, Belgrad's giving way remains a prerequisite. "We want to
put an end to the humanitarian catastrophe and to the heavy and systematic
human rights violations as soon as possible. We want to reach a peaceful
political solution for Kosovo."

<P>
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer emphasized that NATO should only cease air
attacks once Milosevic starts withdrawing his troups from Kosovo. "A
unilateral announcement of ceasefire would lead to endless negotiations,
with the result that Mr. Milosevic would carry through his ethnical warfare
against the Kosovo-Albanian population."

<P>
Only the PDS demanded an immediate stopp of NATO bombings. Chairman Gysi:
"Which single bomb has alleviated which single suffering of a single
Kosova-Albanian? Not a single bomb!"

<P>
Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping replied that Gysi would ignore the misery
of thousands of displaced Kosova-Albanians. "Is it all just fiction and
propaganda that people tell us about the smashing of dead bodies with
baseball-bats? That they are being severed and decapitated?"

<P>
Chairman of the Union, Wolfgang Schaeuble, asked to consider: "Apparently,
Milosevic has underestimated the determination and unity of the free
people's community. However, ladies and gentlemen, will his stubbornness
also cause damage to his own people?"

<P>
Bavarian State Premier Edmund Stoiber warned against the intervention of
groundtroups. "Russia will consider NATO groundtroup actions as a very
serious decision with far-reaching consequences and risks of escalation."

Bavarian SPD critisizes cancellations of school lessons in Bavaria
</H1>
The Bavarian SPD-fraction demands exact information about the cancellations
of school lessons in Bavaria. So far, the Ministry of Culture has published
spot checks only - due to "administrative technicalities", as they said.
The SPD suspects the real reasons behind the cancellations to be concealed.
According to the spot checks, junior high schools lost 1.3 % of their
lessons. Middle high schools had a loss of 2.1 %, and high schools of 4%.
In these statistics, mere supervision of pupils, without actual teaching,
has been considered a 'non-lost' lesson.
