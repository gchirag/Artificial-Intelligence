Government apparently planning civil service salary cuts
</H1>
Civil servants apparently have to adjust to a reduction in their
income and pensions. The newspaper the "Bild am Sonntag" reports that the
governing coalition are planning to increase the retirement age and to make
cuts in certain allowances. Firemen, court officials, policemen and
soldiers will have to work a year longer than has presently been the case.
The amount of supplementary income allowed to supplement pensions will in
future also be limited for retired civil servants. Furthermore, allowances
will no longer be included in calculating pensions. Mr. Marschewski, the
spokesman for internal political affairs for the CDU/CSU parliamentary
fraction, said that the coalition's working committee would present for
approval its suggestions for reforming the civil service by the end of May
this year.

HBV wants to push through the 35 hour working week
</H1>
The Union for trade, bank, and insurance employees (HBV) wants
to push through the 35 hour working week in their current wage negotiations
for 465 000 bank employees. Mr. Karlin, a member of the board of the HBV,
said today at the second round of wage negotiations in Frankfurt, that this
reduction of four hours a week could safeguard 50 000 jobs. However, the
HBV had not yet made concrete suggestions regarding their wage demands. Mr.
Karlin demanded that full pay for sick leave be guaranteed by the wage
agreement. Employers are, in principle, willing to do this, but want
compensation for this concession.

Lafontaine: SPD is sticking to its policy on pension reform
</H1>
The national head of the Social Democrats (SPD), Oskar Lafontaine, has
announced that his party is going to stick to their policy on pension
reform. Mr. Lafontaine said to the Deutschlandfunk radio station that the
coalition's suggestions for pension reform were not a reform, but rather a
way of cutting pensions. These cutbacks would, he said, mainly affect
women, making them social welfare cases. The SPD could not accept this. Mr.
Lafontaine made clear that his party would not balk at refusing to reach a
consensus on the issue. The SPD council will decide tomorrow [Monday]
whether the party were prepared to reach a compromise on the pension issue
with the CDU/CSU and the FDP. The SPD special committee for pension reform
has recommended against a compromise.

</H1>

Democratic Party (FDP), Mr Westerwelle, has called for consensus. He said
to Hesse Radio, however, that this should not just be a showcase
discussion, as was the case in the debate on tax reform.

Construction industry strikes more and more certain
</H1>
The German construction industry is being threatened by strikes for the
first time since 1950. According to a spokesman for the Union of the
construction industry, IG Bau, most of the regional wage negotiations in
western Germany have voted against accepting the ruling of the arbitrator,
Heiner Geissler. The only area to accept the ruling is Saxony-Anhalt. Union
members from Saxony will probably also vote against accepting the ruling.
The largest collective bargaining commission for IG Bau will decide
tomorrow [Monday] whether or not to accept the arbitration ruling.
Construction workers have warned the Union against accepting the ruling. Mr
Kuechler, the vice president of the German building contractor's
association, said to the German News Agency (dpa) that there would be grave
problems for the industry if the wilful decision to strike were to go
ahead.

Exchange of words at the Juso congress in Berlin
</H1>
There was some discussion as to future policy at the federal
congress of the Young Socialists (Juso), the day after the surprise
election battle for leadership. Stefan Grueger, who was defeated in the
poll, accused Andrea Nales, the leader of the Young Socialists, of being
disinterested in a course of integration. He said that the new federal
committee comprising nine members was dominated by the left and that they
had only one representative from eastern Germany. This was an indication of
the bias in the Juso as a whole. Ms. Nales called the accusations laughable
and opened discussion on the future role of the Young Socialists. The
congress in Berlin for the junior members of the SPD ended today with a
debate on woman's issues.
