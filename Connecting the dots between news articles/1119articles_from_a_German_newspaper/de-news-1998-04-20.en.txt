RAF appears to have dissolved itself
</H1>
After approximately 28 years since their founding date, it appears that
the terror organization Red Army Faction declared itself dissolved. The
federal prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe reported that a letter to this
effect had been received at Reuters news agency. The letter states,
among other things: "Today we are concluding this project. The urban
guerilla form of the RAF is now history." Early comments by security
experts confirmed the authenticity of the document. The federal
prosecutor's office in Karlsruhe acknowledged the receipt of the
document at Reuters but it added that the federal bureau of
investigation in Wiesbaden would still have to examine the document for
its authenticity. The document states that in order to find ways out of
the dead end it was necessary first to realize that one was actually in
such a situation. The document says: "The end of this project shows that
we could not succeed taking this path, but it does not invalidate the
necessity and legitimacy of the revolution." It was a mistake not to
build a political and social organization next to an armed organization.
We overestimated the effectiveness of military actions. The government
in Bonn had restrained reactions to reports on the supposed selfdissolving. The RAF made the news during the 70s primarily because of
numerous assassination attempts. Among their victims were Schleyer, the
president of the employers' union, and attorney general Buback.

Rejection of FDP demand for abolition of solidarity supplement
</H1>
Chacellor Kohl entered the debate over the demand by the FDP to abolish
the solidarity supplement. Following a meeting of the federal board of
the CDU in Bonn, Kohl said that whoever demanded such a deep change of
the tax law should have to state how he would finance it. Earlier, the
position of the liberals had already encountered rejection within the
coalition opposition. But criicism also came from the SPD and the
Greens. In the meantime, leading politicians defended the position of
their party. Faction leader Solms stressed that the time-restriction of
the supplement had been obvious at its introduction. General secretary
Westerwelle also talked about good news for the states in the East since
an abolition of the solidarity supplement would also ease the financial
burden of those living in the East.

</H1>
The Minister of Education and the Arts in Baden-Wuerttemberg, Scharvan
(CDU), continues to insist on her plan for a reform of the upper schoollevel despite criticism. Her ministry published details of the concept
today. These details propose to remove the differentiation between
accelerated and basic courses. One of the reasons for this venture lies
in the continued complaint by students that the accelerated courses in
the current system of the upper school led to a degree in specilization
that was too high. Scharvan's plans had been criticized during the last
days by the opposition parties of SPD and Greens as well as the state
