Parliament in a row over 630 marks jobs
</H1>
Government and opposition parties fought vigorously over the reform of
the so-called 630-marks jobs. There are plans to do away with tax-exemptions
and charge contributions to the public social-security system instead.
Deputy leader of the opposition parliamentary group Kuehs called that a
cop-out, government trying to become richer by taking money out of peoples'
pockets for social-security. Family Minister Christine Bergmann, however,
defended the proposal: "I think that women will have a better chance of
getting decent part-time, or even full-time work, in the medium run, because
the new system makes casual work less attractive for employers. We can't
just sit on the fence and moan about dwindling numbers of people paying into
the system, when at the same time millions are not paying their share by
using a perfectly legal loophole. Our proposals will put a stop to that, and
that's why I am glad we've finally got this draft law."

Parliament debates scrapping of married-couples' tax-privilege
</H1>
Following a ruling by the Federal Constitutional Court
(Bundesverfassungsgericht) about tax-rebates for families, government
intends to come up with a draft law until this summer. During question-andanswer time at parliament, SPD financial expert Ms Matthaeus-Mayer said that
married couples with children as well as sole-parents would be winning.
It is still moot how government will pay for that. The Greens are thinking
about scrapping the special tax-privilege for married couples, to cover the
expected shortfall. Members of the opposition parties, however, said that
this could be against the constitution

Metal-industry's award-talks postponed without results
</H1>
There was nor progress in the metal-workers' award-negotiations. Bavaria
postponed negotiations after 2 hours of talks, and more of the same
happened in Hesse, Rhine-land/Palatinate and Saar. The unions refused to
accept the employers' offer to raise salaries and wages by 2%. The employers
had also offered a one-off payment of .5%, depending on the companies'
economic situation. Head of the union Zwickel said that they would not
allow a two-class system for staff. They asked for a (general) 6.5% rise,

Guenther Strack's funeral
</H1>
Today the late actor Guenther Strack was put to rest in Franconia's
Muenchsteinach. Approximately 300 people followed the hearse to the
St Nikolaus Cathedral, with some 2,000 spectators lining the streets.
Loudspeakers made sure sermon and eulogy could be heard outside the church.
Hesses's State Premier Eichel, a close friend of the family, was shaken
when he said: "His art has touched us all, he was one of the actors who
will still be there long after they've gone."

Success in court
</H1>
Bavarian police acted outside the law during the visit of China's head of
state Xiang-Tse-Min in 1995. According to a ruling by the Munich
Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht), police had had no right to
interfere with a demonstration organised by Amnesty International (who also
had applied for and obtained a permit for it). Police had deployed a
brass-band and a bus in a way that made the demonstration useless. When
the convoy turned 'round the corner, they drove the bus right in front of
the demonstrators, and that's when the brass-band started playing as well,
making sure the demonstrators were neither seen nor heard. At the time, some
50 demonstrators had wanted to protest against human rights violations in
China using banners.

Only few Germans shop on the Internet
</H1>
Only few Germans are shopping on the Internet, according to a study by
Bielefeld's market research institute EMNID and Stuttgart's Frauenhofer
Institut. Last year only 1% of all Germans bought something on the Internet,
occasionally, whereas 4% tried it out once and 95% didn't even want to try.
Reasons: loading the relevant brochures, also called WWW-pages, onto their
computers takes very long, and the pages are not well organised. And apart
from that, telephone calls are expensive (all calls are metered), plus many
people are afraid of putting confidential data on the Internet, such as
their credit-card numbers
