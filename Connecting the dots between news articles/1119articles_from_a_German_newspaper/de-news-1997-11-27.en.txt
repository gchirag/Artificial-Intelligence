40,000 students protest in Bonn
</H1>
Representatives of striking students, addressing an audience of
around 40,000, demanded that cuts be made in other public budget
positions in favor of education funds. During the closing
demonstration in Bonn's Hofgarten a students' representative said
the lack of funds was not an act of God. He said there was a lot
of misspending. It should be possible to cut defense spending if
there were a political disposition.

<P>
The demonstration was the apex to date of the protests that have
been going on for weeks. Overcrowded classrooms, underequipped
libraries and the threat of introducing tuition payment are among
the motives for the action.

<P>
Belatedly, a dialogue with minister for education Ruettgers took
place. The students presented their demands and it was decided to
continue the talks.

<P>
Landfried, chairman of the university heads' conference, said
that there was a DM 9 billion a year deficit in university
financing. SPD (Social-Democratic party) chairman Oskar
Lafontaine blames the federal government for the deficit
situation in higher education. The FDP (Liberal party)
encouraged students to continue their protests in the states.

Third day of budget debate
</H1>
Government and opposition continued their fight over economic and
social policies into the third day of the budget debate. In the
course of the discussion, Minister for Economy Rexrodt stressed
that a turnaround in the labor situation was to be expected due
to government policy reforms. The way to higher employment was
tax reduction and continued privatization. Minister for Labor
Bluem defended his retirement plan proposal and demanded relief
for contributors. The proposals submitted by SPD would lead to
continually higher disbursements and were therefore
irresponsible.

<P>
North-Rhine Westphalia's Minister of Economy Clement (SPD)
countered that all government offered in view of an impending
increase of unemployment to 5 million was the sole principle of
hope. He appealed to the Union parties and the FDP to accept the
SPD's offer of compromise on tax and social security reforms.
SPD's social expert voiced his opinion that the government
coalition was paralyzed due to internal dissent. Alliance90/Green
Party said the government policy lacked a basic concept.
<P>
Budget details of the ministries of environment and of
transportation were also part of the debate. The 1998 budget and
the 1997 supplementary budget should be decided by tomorrow.
<P>
At night, Minister for Construction Toepfer took leave from the

Suessmuth continues favorable towards FDP disbursements
</H1>
Bundestag president Rita Suessmuth reiterated her defense of
party subvention payments to FDP. Earlier, she had reported to
the Bundestag's council of elders on the matter. Later she
declared in Bonn that the council had not vented any criticism.
But there is not as yet a decision on whether this year's quota
of DM2 million would be shelled out to the Liberals. This matter
is still under consideration.

<P>
The SPD proposed to pay the amounts due to FDP into a blocked
account. Under prevailing circumstances, no additional funds
should at this time be handed over to the Liberals. SPD's faction
leader Struck stressed that in case of a final judicial decision
against FDP, the funds would have to reverft to the Bundestag.
<P>

The Cologne Administrative Court had declared the disbursement of
approximately DM12 million for 1996 unlawful due to errors in
the formal application.

Lufthansa victory in antitrust suit
</H1>
Deutsche Lufthansa was victorious in a court fight against the
federal anti-trust agency concerning air fare prices on the
Berlin - Frankfurt/Main route. The agency had ordered the company
not to charge rates more than DM 10 above prices for comparable
distances. Lufthansa's main argument was that the price for
flights between the 2 cities was below cost. The anti-trust
senate of the Berlin higher court canceled the agency's order.

Berlin Wall shooters condemned
</H1>
Two former GDR border guards have been sentenced to 15 months on
probation each in a judgment around one of the last persons
killed trying to escape across the Berlin wall. They had shot 25-
year-old Michael Bittner, who was trying to cross the wall by
means of a ladder, in November, 1985. During the judgment, it
could not be ascertained who had fired the mortal shots. They
were therefore found guilty of joint manslaughter.

BfA (employees' pension administration) lose billions of DM
</H1>
The Bundesversicherungsanstalt fuer Angestellte
(employees' pension administration) complains about losses to the
tune of billions of DM. More and more, retail companies are
issuing their employees merchandise vouchers instead of money
Christmas bonuses. As these vouchers are exempt from contribution
to the social security system, the employers make savings in
taxes and social contributions while the pension administration
loses income. The BfA therefore calls on the Bonn government to
declare merchandise vouchers subject to social security
contributions.

Consumers union warns against household questionnaires
</H1>
The Verbraucherzentrale (consumers union) issued a warning
against questionnaires being circulated at present.
According to the central, these questionnaires have nothing to do
with market research.
<P>
They therefore advise to either throw the forms away or return
them to sender unfilled and postage unpaid. The originator will
have to pay postal charges for an empty piece of paper. These
last days, thousands of households are receiving mailings from
2 outfits called Klaritas(sp?) and Infas Lifestyle(sp?).
Questions range about leisure habits, income, savings amounts,
bank connections, and such. The intent is to gather personal
information and addresses and pass them along to commercial
enterprises. People who fill out the papers will have to prepare
to be flooded with spam.
