Holzmann to reduce 3.000 jobs
</H1>
Shattered construction company Holzmann plans to reduce its
number of jobs by 3.000 in order to become healthier. A sale of shares will
cause 2.000 further Holzmann employees to get a new employer. Holzmann
chairman Hinrich said during a shareholder's meeting that the company
needed a new chance after the almost-bankruptcy at the end of November.
Rehabilitaions plans also include a so-called 'capital-cut'. This means
that the basic capital will be reduced from around 300 to around DM 12bn,
and that, subsequently, it will be stocked up with new shares. Initially,
this will bring losses to shareholders. However, they have reached a
majority decision on these plans.

financing system of former CDU Chairman Helmut Kohl. Prosecution will start
preliminary proceedings against Kohl on Monday because he collected DM 2
millions without declaring them as donations to the party. Because of this,
prosecution suspects disloyalty to the detriment of the CDU
