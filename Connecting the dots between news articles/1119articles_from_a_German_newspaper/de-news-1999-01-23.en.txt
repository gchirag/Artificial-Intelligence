Battle lines harden before negotiations with the power companies
</H1>
With negotiations about to begin between German energy concerns and Mr.
Trittin, the Minister of the Environment, there are no signs of compromise.
Trittin, a Green, rejected an offer by the power companies to stop
reprocessing nuclear fuel in 5 years, as opposed to stopping in the year
2000.  
<P>
Minister Trittin also refused to give in to the industry's demand that
100 Castor transports a year be permitted after the reprocessing ban has gone
into effect, because this figure is excessive in view of the actual amount of
nuclear waste being generated.  As for the industry's plans that the waste
might be sent to Russia, Trittin called the idea absurd.

</H1>
 Alliance 90/The Greens have accused the CDU and the CSU of
stirring up hatred against foreigners with their petition campaign against
dual citizenship. Executive Spokespersons Ms. Roestel and Ms. Radtke made
similar statements at a small party caucus in Frankfurt. The delegates
convened to discuss the election program for the upcoming European elections,
which deviates in parts from the coalition agreement made with the SPD.

<P>
The small party caucus passed a resolution titled "Equal Rights For All."  In
it, the Greens appealed to the populace not to sign the CSU/CDU petitions
against dual citizenship.  The campaign came down to simple prejudice against
foreigners, the Greens said.

Bottlenecks expected in train service at the beginning of the week
</H1>
There might be bottlenecks in train service at the beginning of the week.  As
a consequence of the recent train accident, 600 cars in local service have
been pulled for safety checks.  The wheels of train cars are supposed to be
checked for stability.  Cars from the former German Reichsbahn are having
their wheel plates inspected to make sure they are safe.  German Rail decided
on this course of action after inspections showed that the wheel fittings of
these wagons are of the same design as those of the regional express that
derailed last week.  A spokesman emphasized that this was purely a
precautionary measure.  The recall might cause local service bottlenecks in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, Saxony-Anhalt, Berlin and Brandenburg and may
also affect Lower Saxony and Bremen.  The measure will have no effect on long
distance travel.
