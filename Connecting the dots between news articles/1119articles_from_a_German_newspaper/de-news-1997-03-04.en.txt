Castor transport continues
</H1>
All six Castor containers were reloaded today onto
special transporters at the Dannenberg railway station in Lower Saxony.
Reloading was completed long before evening and thus much earlier than
planned. No serious incidents have occurred - only a few paint bags were
thrown by members of the crowd of some 3,000 anti-nuclear demonstrators
in the direction of police officers guarding the site. Police reported
disturbances, however, along the 20 km stretch of road between Dannenberg
and the nuclear waste storage facility in Gorleben. Some 1,000 rioters
(around 250 of which have subsequently been arrested) threw rocks and
Molotov cocktails at police officers. Demonstrators are still blocking
the planned route to Gorleben which the nuclear transport is supposed to
use tomorrow, even to the extent of placing obstacles in the road at
several places. Alternative routes have also been blocked by
demonstrators. Despite this, Lower Saxony's Minister of the Interior, Mr
Glogowski, insists that the Castor containers will be transported to the
interim storage facility tomorrow, even if the transport takes longer
than planned due to the protest actions.

<P>
The Greens have urged the authorities to send the
nuclear waste back to the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant. Juergen
Trittin, spokesman for the Greens, said that in view of the massive scale
of the peaceful protests the authorities had no other option. Mr Trittin
had also participated in the demonstrations in Dannenberg.

German President calls for more tolerance
</H1>
German President Roman Herzog has called for more tolerance
towards all people and all cultures in Germany. At the opening event of
the European Year against Racism Mr Herzog said that people should use
their hearts and heads to promote inter-racial understanding. It was too
much to expect the State to fight alone against xenophobia and
anti-semitism. Every person has to play their part in achieving this
goal, Mr Herzog asserted at the event held at the Centre for the Cultures
of the World in Berlin. He continued that foreigners had made a
considerable contribution to Germany's economic success as both employees
and business owners. It was therefore legitimate that they should want to
be integrated into society; something which should be supported by all.

<P>
The national committee organising several events in honour of the
anti-racism year has criticised the introduction of compulsory visas for
foreign children, maintaining that this communicates the wrong sort of
message and is inconsistent as a prelude for the special year against
racism.

Bavaria plans to introduce annual highway toll before 1999
</H1>
The Bavarian government has called for a nation-wide introduction
of an annual highway toll by January 1, 1999 at the latest. The State
cabinet has approved a scheme which will be presented to the Bundesrat
(upper house of parliament) by Bavaria in April. According to the scheme,
the toll will cost DM 80 to DM 100 annually for cars and small lorries
with a total weight of less than 12t. The scheme also provides for weekly
and bimonthly tolls. Bavaria's Minister of Economics, Mr Wiesheu, expects
DM 2.9 billion in  nation-wide revenues which will go towards road
construction. Mr Wiesheu claimed that the Bavarian initiative was
justified by the decrease in Federal grants for road construction.

Many schools contaminated with PCB
</H1>
Several thousand schools in West Germany are contaminated by the
poisonous chemical PCB, according to the ZDF TV station. Hundreds of
thousands of school children and teachers are thus exposed to the
chemical on a daily basis. PCB damages the immune and nervous system and
can be carcinogenic. According to ZDF, many communities are not
interested in further investigation of the problem, as they would have to
find the funds to decontaminate the affected buildings.
