First consensus meeting on nuclear phase-out
</H1>
In the course of the first consensus meeting on nuclear policy, the
federal
government and nuclear power companies reached an agreement. Government
will not enforce strict dates for putting an end to recycling and for a
general atomic
energy shutdown. Industry, on the other hand, declared their willingness to
work
out phasing-out schedules for every individual plant. Minister for ecology
Trittin
called this a "partial success".
SPD and Green Party coalition leaders agreed to present the revised draft
for the
new law on nuclear power by late February or early March. The second
consensus
meeting is planned for early in March.
After the consensus had been reached, foreign minister Fischer declared
himself
in agreement with ecology minister Trittin's course. In a Green party caucus
meeting, Fischer said the fact that nuclear industry was willing to talk
about a
phase-out was a historic turnaround. He also said the overall aim of nuclear
phase-out was more important than keping to the 100 day schedule for
changing
nuclear legislation.

Compromise settlement for corporate eco-tax
</H1>
The red-green coalition have reached a compromise in the ecolocy tax
scrap.
All manufacturing companies are to pay but 20% of the additional tax on
electricity,
fuel oil, and natural gas. Average consumers will have to pay a surtax of 2
pfennigs
per kWh of electricity, 4 pfennigs for a litre of fuel oil, and 0,32
pfennigs for natural
gas. The 6 pfennig surtax on automotive gasoline will have to be paid by
everubody
without distinction. The proceeds of this ecological tax will be used by the
government
to reduce retirement contributions. Companies where the eco-tax payments
exceed
retirement contribution savings will be reimbursed for the difference by the
internal
revenue office, said SPD vice-faction leader Ms. Matthaeus-Maier. She showed
herself
confident that on April 1st both the eco-tax and the retirement contribution
reductions
will come into force.

CDU/CSU petition campaign starts in Bavaria
</H1>
In the face of opposition protest actions, the union parties'
petition action
against dual citizenship for resident aliens was started. Both SPD and
Greens accuse
the CSU of waging a campaign against resident alien citizens. Ms. Schmidt,
Bavaria's
SPD chairwoman, said that the action tended to promote a division within
society
instead of integration. CSU faction leader Glueck countered that these
accusations were
a motley construction of vilification, slander , and defamation. For people
living in Germany,
a basic cultural background of a Christian/occidental character was
essential; a
multi-cultural society was not called for, he said. State premier Stoiber
announced that
the union parties had started the petition campaign in view of the fact that
the majority
popular opinion was not in accord with the federal government's opinion.
