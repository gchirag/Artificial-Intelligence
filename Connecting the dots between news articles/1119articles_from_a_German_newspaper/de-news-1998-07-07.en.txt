Less unemployment in June
</H1>
The number of registered unemployed persons in Germany fell
to a little less than 4.1 million in June, a decrease of some 120,000
compared to the previous month. The unemployment rate is now at 10.5%,
compared to 10.9% in May. President of the Federal Labour Office
Bernhard Jagoda said unemployment fell more than typical in a month
of June. An important reason for this was the extension of job creation
schemes. Also the recovery has gained more pace.

<P>
The coalition government and the opposition assessed the new unemployment
figures differently. The government interprets them as a general
turn-around on the job market and expects less than four million
unemployed persons in autumn. Federal Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt
said the recovery is now extending from western states to East-Germany
as well. The President of the Confederation of Employers, Mr Hundt sees
a breakthrough on the job market.

<P>
Unions, Social Democrats and The Greens, however, pointed out that the
government has created many new job creation schemes, obviously
because of the approaching general elections in autumn. President of
the Federal Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said that in spite of the recovery
on the job market a drop below the current level was not in sight.

<P>
In the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the number of unemployed people
fell by 10,400 in the past month. The unemployment rate went down
by 0.2% to 6.7%.

<P>
In more than 300 cities nation-wide, again job seekers were protesting
against mass unemployment and poverty.

Factions of governing coalition approve budget draft 1999
</H1>
At a special meeting, the factions of CDU/CSU and FDP have
approved Finance Minister Theo Waigel's budget bill 1999. CDU/CSU
faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said Mr Waigel had succeeded in
drawing up a budget bill that provides for more money for education
and research and that keeps current subsidies for the Eastern states,
although there have hardly been any margins for changes.

<P>
Criticism came from the Social Democrats. The budget expert, Mr Diller
reproached Mr Waigel for pushing the national debt higher and higher,
and to give in to the current level of mass unemployment. Instead
of making real budget cuts the minister relied on patchwork. The
Greens criticised the budget bill as well.

<P>
Waigel's bill is supposed to be approved by the cabinet tomorrow,
to be discussed in parliament in September. The budget bill has a
volume of DM465 billion, with a budget deficit of DM56 billion.

transportation expert of The Greens, Ms Altmann had called for a general
reassessment of all motorway building projects, shifting priorities
