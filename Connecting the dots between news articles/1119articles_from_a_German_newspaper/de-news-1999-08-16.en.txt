Eichel denies reports on Diesel tax hike
</H1>
Finance minister Eichel denied reports on a plan to raise
taxes on Diesel fuel. That was not in the making, Eichel
said in Berlin. The boulevard paper "Bild-Zeitung", citing
SPD sources, had reported that the tax on Diesel fuel was
to be raised by DM .36 a liter. The Greens faction financial
spokesman Mueller, on the other hand, said that this matter
was under consideration. Speaking to Radio Hesse, he said
his faction had submitted a request to Eichel and to the
SPD faction to this effect. In his opinion, the Diesel tax hike
would be effective within the current legislative term.

Reactions to desecration of Ignatz Bubis tomb
</H1>
Germany's ambassador to Israel, Wimar, manifested revolt in his
reaction to the desecration of Ignatz Bubis' tomb. Speaking
in Tel Aviv, he said it was an ironic fact that the perpetrator
was an Israeli.
Earlier, the vice-chairwoman of Germany's Jewish council, Knobloch,
had also commented the matter. In Berlin, she called it the deed
of a mentally disturbed person.
Israeli artist Meir Mendelssohn had splashed black paint over
the tomb shortly after the burial services in Tel Aviv yesterday.
He accused the deceased of collaboration with the Nazis and of
omission in representing Jewish interests.
In his last will, Bubis had asked to be buried in Israel so his
tomb would not be desecrated as was his predecessor's, Galinski,
in Germany.

Less Christmas bonus for coal miners
</H1>
Some 60,000 Ruhr coal miners will suffer cuts in their Christmas
bonuses this year. According to an announcement by a union
spokesman of the IG Bergbau, Chemie, Energie in Bochum, the
reason is the continuing recession in the area. In order to
avoid outright dismissals, shift reductions without pay would
become necessary. Per suspended shift, .5% of yearly income
will be deducted from pay. There is no firm date yet for the talks
between the union
and the employers' association Ruhr Bergbau
about this matter nor has the scope of possible reductions been
established.

Zurwehme said to have menaced a woman in Cuxhaven 3 weeks ago
</H1>
The presumed "killer of Remagen", Dieter Zurwehme, apparently
tried to rape a woman in Cuxhaven 3 weeks ago. Police say
that the criminological analysis of a knapsack found at the site
of the occurrence points in that direction. Only today, police
informed that Zurwehme had accosted the 19-year old woman,
menacing her with a gun and ordering her to lie down on
the ground, but took flight when passers-by turned up. He
left behind a knapsack on which the Hanover state criminal
office found digital impressions and DNA traces pointing to
Zurwehme. A dragnet in the Cuxhaven area showed no results to
date, the police said.
Zurwehme, considered "highly dangerous", had escaped from
Bielefeld prison during a walk he was allowed to take. He is
presumed to have killed 4 persons during his flight.
