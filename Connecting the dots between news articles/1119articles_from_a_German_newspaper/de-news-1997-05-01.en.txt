Union rallies on Labor Day
</H1>
All across Germany, more than 100,000 people have taken part in the annual
May rallies on today's Labor Day, protesting against unemployment and the
deterioration of the welfare state.  The events were held under the motto
of securing the welfare state, creating jobs, and implementing social
justice.  DGB [National Trade Union Federation] chairman Mr.  Schulte
accused the government and corporations of pursuing a policy that
accelerates the loss of jobs.  At the same time, he referred to the
options of reducing overtime hours and increasing part time work.  In an
interview on Deutschlandfunk radio, Mr. Schulte added that the key to
increased employment lies in the hands of private and public employers.
In view of the economic growth, the preconditions for new jobs have never
been more favorable.  People are more willing to accept shorter hours or
part time employment for a limited period of time, the DGB chairman said.
In addition, he said he was willing to negotiate an agreement with the
employer association to establish a framework for the reduction of
overtime work.  In Leipzig, the chairman of IG Metall, Mr. Zwickel,
underscored his call for a 32-hour working week.  The head of DAG
[National Union of Employees], Mr. Issen, demanded a change of power in
Bonn.

Clashes between left and right wing extremists
</H1>
Following the ban on a NPD [Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschland,
National Democratic Party of Germany, right wing party] rally in Leipzig,
the dreaded gathering of right-wing extremists failed to materialize.
Nevertheless, in clashes between right and left-wing extremists, more than
100 people were taken into custody.  Several Neo-Nazis went on the rampage
in Hannoverschmuenden near Kassel. In Berlin, a massive police presence
prevented acts of vandalism at a demonstration held by more than 6,000
extreme leftists.  In the Prenzlauer Berg district, a street fight ensued.

European Union to adhere to common policy towards Iran
</H1>
The presidency of the European Union, currently held by The Netherlands,
has called on member countries to postpone the already agreed-upon return
of their diplomats to Iran.  Iran must not succeed in driving a wedge into
the Union, it was said.  Previously Iran had confirmed that the German
Ambassador to Teheran is not welcome there at the present time.  Foreign
Minister Kinkel emphasized that the totally unreasonable reaction of Iran
is apparently linked to the presidential election campaign currently under
way in the country.

Further decrease in number of ethnic German immigrants
</H1>
The number of ethnic Germans immigrating to the Federal Republic continues
to decline.  According to information released by the Interior Ministry in
Bonn, almost 11,500 ethnic Germans moved to Germany in April, most of them
from countries of the former Soviet Union.  One year ago the number stood
at 13,280.  Since the beginning of the year, immigration of ethnic Germans
has decreased by roughly 8,900 to 45,300, compared to the same period in
1996.  The decline is related to the mandatory German language test prior
to emigration from the former USSR, the Interior Ministry explained.
