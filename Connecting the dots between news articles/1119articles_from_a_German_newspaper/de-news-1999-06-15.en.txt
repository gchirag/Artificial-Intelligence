The civilian personnel of the Bundeswehr, Germany's armed forces,
will be reduced by 10'000 until the end of 2002. This was announced by

German Red Cross: Kosovo aid cannot rely only on donations
</H1>
Baden-Baden: The German Red Cross (GRC) has argued for government aid for
Kosovo
refugees. In an interview with SWR radio, GRC president Mr Ipsen said his
organization could not finance the many tasks with just donations. In view
of the incredible destruction in Kosovo, the refugee camps would not be
closed soon. The main task now was to supply the distressed population with
food, water, and medication. The Red Cross is prepared for an engagement
that will last many years. According to Mr Ipsen, the organization will also
set up a people search agency.

each been sentenced to 14 years in prison. The Potsdam Regional Court

Meat salmonella source number one
</H1>
Among all categories of food, meat is the one most contaminated
by salmonella. According to the annual report by Baden-Wuerttemberg's
State Health Board, every fifth sample of meat coming from warm-blooded
animals contains salmonella. Out of 4,000 checked samples tested last year
by the Board for salmonella, they objected to 50. That constitutes the lowest
percentage rate for eight years. The number of salmonella infections in the
state is continuing to fall, as well. Last year, 10,200 infections were
reported to the board, less than half the number of seven years ago.

Coca Cola: Poisoning problem widens
</H1>
Following similar actions in Belgium, the state
authorities of Luxembourg now also banned the sale of all Coca Cola
beverages. The Belgium Health Board have stated that since the middle
of last week, at least 101 cases of poisoning after the consumption
of Coca Cola beverages were registered.

<P>
German consumers are not affected according to Coca-Cola GmbH [the
German subsidary]. The Hessian Ministry for Social Affairs ordered
checks of products of the brands Coca Cola, Fanta and Sprite in the
meantime. In the State of Rhineland-Palatinate, some Coca Cola cases
originating from Belgium have been seized.

According to the Coca Cola corporation, it meanwhile has identified the
sources of the poisoning of its products. In one case, it was triggered
by misuse of carbondioxide in a Belgium plant. In an other case, there
was a problem with some beverage cans in a plant in the French city of
Dunkerque: a small number of pallets used to transport the cans had
become contaminated with fungicide.
