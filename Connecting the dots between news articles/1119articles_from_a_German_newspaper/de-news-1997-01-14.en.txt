Lafontaine: reduce wage fringe costs immediately
</H1>
SPD secretary-general Oskar Lafontaine has called on the government to
reduce social insurance contributions immediately. The benefit for
individuals and companies could be balanced by higher taxes on energy
consumption, Lafontaine said. He further demanded a radical new direction
in economy and finance politics. Lafontaine said it was vital to reduce the
tax burden of workers and families to boost economic demand in Germany. The
annually increasing tax burden put a stranglehold on consumption within
Germany, according to the SPD politician. He also vehemently criticized
plans by the government to tax pensions and life insurances. Lafontaine
pointed out the contradiction to the government's plans to encourage
private pension plans.
Leader of the SPD Bundestag faction Rudolf Scharping also criticized plans
by the government to tax pensions. Talking to journalists he said the SPD
would not allow that the federal budget is repaired by taking from seniors.

Pension indexing to be relaxed?
</H1>
Storm, CDU member of parliament, suggested that in future public
pensions should increase more slowly. Storm is member of the government's
pension committee. In an interview Storm stated the existing coupling of
public old-age pensions to the general increase of net incomes must be
corrected. According to the present rule, pensions would be increased by
1.7 percent in July. Storm said it may be possible to limit the increase to
1.3 percent. Such a reduction would mean that pensioners were paid about 63
percent of their last net income after 45 years of pension contributions
instead of 70 percent. Such reductions are necessary to keep the
"generation contract" [between the working and the retired generation] fair.

Final arguments in Graf trial: Prosecutor demands seven years for Mr. Graf
</H1>
In the trial of tennis star Steffi Graf's father Peter Graf the Prosecution
has made its final arguments. The Prosecution demanded a sentence of six
years and nine months. Prosecutor Gabriele Schoepf argued that Mr. Graf had
failed to declare DM42million of Steffi Graf's income, thus reducing the
tax bill by about DM19.2m. He was guilty of simple and serious tax fraud
just like his tax advisor Joachim Eckardt. Therefore the high sentence was
justified. For Mr. Eckardt Ms. Schoepf demanded four years and nine months
imprisonment. The prosecution also demanded to reactivate the arrest
warrants suspended in November, because of increased risk of escape. The
sentence is expected for 24 January.

Employers: 2 million new jobs are unrealistic
</H1>
Employers think the creation of 2 million new jobs till the year 2000 is
unrealistic. President of the Federal Association of German Industries
(BDI) Hans-Olaf Henkel pointed out that to reach this target the right
conditions must be set this year. One of the requirements is a reduction of
the tax burden of companies, a smaller welfare budget, and a reform of work
contract regulations. Henkel also pointed out that 2 million new jobs could
be created relatively quickly but the chances to reach the target by the
year 2000 are now much smaller than last year.
Employer president Dieter Hundt stressed that now politicians, workers,
employers, and companies must co-operate to halve the number of unemployed
until the end of the decade.

More rigid illness checks for government employees
</H1>
The federal Cabinet has approved plans by Interior Minister Manfred Kanther
to reduce the illness rate of government employees. In future, government
employees will have to provide a medical certificate already after the
first day of illness. Moreover, superiors will be allowed to check on
employees when their absenteeism is conspicuous. When employees are
repeatedly ill for short periods superiors may also consider whether the
worker is still suitable for the position. Kanther argued that the 550,000
government employees are more often ill on average than employees in the
private economy. However, government employees are less often absent than
private economy workers.
