CSU and FDP disagree over European Union policy
</H1>
A renewed quarrel has broken out between CSU and FDP over
questions of policy towards the European Union. Bavaria's state
premier Stoiber came out in favor of taking competence on
European Union policies out of the foreign ministry's hands. In
an interview to news magazine "Focus", Stoiber advocated creating
a special ministry for Europe as practiced by other European
countries. The new minister would report directly to the federal
chancellor. The foreign ministry, in Stoiber's opinion, thinks
too much along diplomatic lines to be able to forcefully fight
for internal German interests.
<P>
FDP parliamentary leader Solms defended foreign minister Kinkel
against Stoiber's criticism. In Bonn, he said European policy
could not be in better hands than Kinkel's. FDP honorary chairman
Genscher warned that with this kind of talk, Stoiber was putting
in jeopardy the Union's electoral prospects.  FDP boss Gerhard
said Bavaria's state premier must understand that CSU has no claim
on supervising German foreign policy.

</H1>
One out of every three Germans has no idea what Easter is
all about, according to a survey conducted by EMNID institute. In
Western Germany, three out of four persons were aware that Easter
is celebrated in memory of Christ's resurrection, against 58% in
Eastern Germany.

date for Easter. In 325 A.D., Easter was decided to be held on
the Sunday following the first full moon in spring. In our
century, the League of Nations and Pope Paul VI proposed to
change the date to the second Sunday in April. This proposal is
now being brought up again within the Catholic Church.
