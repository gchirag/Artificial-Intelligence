Sentences for accused in Schlecker proceedings
</H1>
Both main defendants in the Schlecker proceedings, Willi Hubelmaier and
Herbert Jakobi, have been sentenced to 13-1/2 years in prison.
Hubelmaier's brother, Dieter, was also sentenced to 7-1/2 years by the
Ulm State Court.  His role was unclear up to the end of the proceedings;
the prosecution was unable to present clear evidence of his
involvement.  Thus Dieter Hubelmaier and his attorney are considering an
appeal.  The judgement against the two other accused was clear my
comparison; both confessed to three kidnappings, among them that of the
Schlecker children, and 5 other offenses.  all other crimes committed by
both expired under the statute of limitations.  Police were able to
recover only 1.6 million Marks of the 18 million Marks taken as ransom.
The rest was split between a rapid change of lifestyle, and heavy losses
on the stock market.
