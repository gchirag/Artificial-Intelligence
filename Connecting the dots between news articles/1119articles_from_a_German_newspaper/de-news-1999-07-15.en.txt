Chancellor and municipalities don't agree on savings package
</H1>
The controversy between the government and the municipalities over the
effects of the savings package continues. A meeting between Chancellor
Schroeder and the representatives of local central organizations in Bonn
ended without concrete results. The municipalities accuse the government of
saving at their expense. The chancellor, nevertheless, was uncompromising.
Minister of Finance Eichel, who also participated in the discussion,
assured only to submit exact calculations over the effects of his savings
package. Mr Eichel thinks that the cities and municipalities will not only
be burdened, but also relieved. The President of the City and Districts
Organization Tallmeier affirmed after the meeting that he strictly rejects
a shift of the burden to cities and municipalities. The municipalities are
afraid of being burdened by the planned modification of rent subsidy, the
rise of child benefits and modification of unemployment relief with about
three to four billion DM. The 30 billion DM designated by Eichel would have
to be saved alone on federal level, so the demand of the local central
associations. Negotiations will continue after the summer break.
