government's set policy. Klimmt stressed that retirement

has it that these reservations are not serious enough to
jeopardize a final positive vote on Romano Prodi's team due
on Sept. 15th. Commissioner-to-be for EU expansion, Verheugen,
said that the admission of additional partners to the Union
would depend on the situation on the employment market.

Bundestag president Thierse appeals to prospective voters
</H1>
In view of the upcoming state elections in Brandenburg and
Sarre states, Bundestag president Thierse directed an appeal
to citizens to participate in the elections casting their
respective votes. The right to vote is one of democracy's
basic rights, he said in an interview to the daily "Leipziger
Volkszeitung". Not to exercise this right would be a
distressing development, especially since Eastern Germans
had fought for it not so long ago. Low participation
carried in itself the danger of favoring extreme right-wing
parties.
