CDU executive board holds special meeting on pension reform
</H1>
The CDU executive board has convened tonight in Bonn for a special meeting to
discuss the planned overhaul of the pension plans.  The reform is based on a
proposal written by an expert panel under the leadership of Labor Minister
Bluem. One point was to gradually reduce pension payments from 70% to 64% of
the after-tax salaries, by the year 2030. The premiums would have to be
increased to almost 23% over the same period of time. Child benefits and
pension claims from years of unemployment due to upbringing of children should
be separated from the general pension funds and be financed through a special
family plan yet to be created from tax revenue. The FDP, but also parts of
CDU/CSU, met the proposal with fierce criticism. The CDU pension commission
announced to present its own bill on Monday.

Preparations for relocation of Parliament on schedule
</H1>
The preparations for the relocation of the Parliament to Berlin in 1999 are
proceeding on budget and on schedule, according to the Coalition and the SPD.
In a topical debate in Parliament held at the request of Alliance 90/The
Greens, speakers of CDU/CSU and SPD jointly rejected the accusation that the
relocation was too expensive. The Parliament building in Berlin is not one of
luxury but one of dignity and adequacy, the head of the construction
commission, Mr. Kansi (CDU) pointed out. The representative of The Greens,
Ms. Alstett-Boehlich, demanded that the cost volume of 20 billion DM be
reduced by at least 2 billion DM. In particular at times when a majority of
the population has to bear severe austerity measures, she said, it is
unacceptable for the government to preach water while drinking wine itself.

Czech reactions to declaration of reconciliation
</H1>
The Bundestag's approval of the German-Czech declaration of reconciliation
has been welcomed by the government in Prague. Czech Foreign Minister
Mr. Zieleniec views the broad majority of the declaration as a positive sign.
The vote shows, he went on, that for the most part, the political spectrum of
Germany has internalized that today's relations with the Czech republic are no
longer burdened by the past and that current efforts can now be focused on the
future. The German Parliament's decision is at the same time an inducement
for the Czech legislators to ratify the declaration as well, Mr. Zieleniec
concluded. The Czech President Mr. Havel called Bonn's decision an important
step towards establishing good relations between the nations of Europe. The
President of the Parliament in Prague, Mr. Seman, however, voiced his
disappointment about the fact that the SPD addendum to the declaration failed.
The chairman of the Czech social democratic party - a party of the Opposition
- said the vote made clear which of the German parties show understanding for
Czech interests. The SPD addition had called for a clear commitment to not
burden the relations with political and legal questions of the past. This
issue had arisen before the background of claims by Sudeten Germans.

Nazi war criminals receiving victim pension
</H1>
For decades, Nazi war criminals have received federal victim pension in
Germany. The Federal Welfare Ministry confirmed a corresponding reportage by
the ARD TV magazine "Panorama". According to the Federal Provision Law of
1950, everybody who had suffered damage, mostly injuries, during the war is
entitled to so-called victim pension, regardless of whether the recipient was
involved in crimes committed by the Nazi regime. Last year alone, the victim
pension, paid to more than one million citizens, had a total volume of 13
billion DM. FDP lawmakers have demanded new legislation barring Nazi war
criminals from eligibility for victim pension.

Wissmann remains firm supporter of Transrapid
</H1>
Federal Transportation Minister Wissmann considers the construction of the
Transrapid [high speed levitation train] vital for its marketability abroad.
The Transrapid project increases the chances for exports of German high
technology products, Wissmann (CDU) said in Bonn. He conceded, however, that
as of now there is little foreign demand for the magnetic levitation train.
The planned route runs between Hamburg and Berlin. The project's future is
dim due to uncertain funding. SPD and The Greens oppose the construction.

Mediation Committee agrees on new regulations for civil servants
</H1>
In the reform of the civil service code, the demand by SPD-led states to
employ civil servants on a part time basis even if that is against their
will, remained a point of controversy until the end. Minister Kanther of the
Interior categorically opposed this suggestion. The solution that was found
leaves it up to the discretion of the states to employ entry-level civil
servants part-time or full-time. This entails that all regulations governing
part-time employment of civil servants now fall under the jurisdiction of the
states, as opposed to the federal government. This consensus by the mediation
committee being achieved, it is now expected that the reform of the civil
service code will find final approval in Bundestag and Bundesrat. Once the
new code becomes effective, civil servants will have a performance-oriented
pay scale. In particular, young officials that work diligently can achieve
promotions more quickly. Moreover, top positions are assigned
non-permanently. Reassignments are now possible without the consent of the
individual.

Ministers of Justice discuss tightening of sexual criminal laws
</H1>
The federal and state Ministers of Justice met last night to discuss the
tightening of sexual criminal laws for better protection aginst child abuse.
The state ministers already agreed in a previous meeting in Bonn that a
tightening of laws alone would not be enough. It is also necessary to
make more money available for therapy. The Coalition plans to increase the
minimum sentence for child abuse from 6 months to 1 year and the maximum
sentence from 10 to 15 years. In addition it will be possible to order
therapy against the will of the convict.

Origin of BSE-perished cow unclear
</H1>
In the latest BSE-case more and more signs indicate manipulation.
The registration number of the cow has also been found on two other
Galloway-cows at different breeders, as was stated by the Minister of
Agriculture, Borchert, in an interrview. The number was also used for a
British import-cow. All numbers were written on the documents in pencil
and it is therefore impossible to track the origin and real name of the
cows.

Mr. Phillips against raise of sales tax
</H1>
The president of the Federal Association of German Trade, Mr. Phillip, has
opposed a raise in sales tax to compensate for the upcoming tax reform. On
Deutschlandradio Berlin, Mr. Phillip warned against the negative effects this
would have on trade. At the same time he welcomed the proposed tax reform in
general, since the tax relief for companies will stimulate demand on the
domestic market. Mr. Phillips rejected remarks by the FDP economics spokesman
Mr. Friedhoff who demanded a comprehensive overhaul of the system of
industry-wide collective bargaining agreements.
