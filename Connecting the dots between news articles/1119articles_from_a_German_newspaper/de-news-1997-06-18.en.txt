Kohl is content with new EU treaty
</H1>
The political leaders of the European Union member states
have agreed a new EU treaty, although certain aspects remain
undecided. Despite this small uncertainty, Chancellor Kohl regards the
results of the summit meeting as an extraordinary success. He said
that the EU will definitely start negotiations with countries which
are candidates for entry to the Union in six months' time and that the
major goal of the inter-governmental conference had been to prepare
the EU for this through a radical change in the treaty.

Government plan for civil servants to pay own pension contributions
</H1>
The federal cabinet has approved the proposal which was put
forward by Manfred Kanther, the Minister of the Interior, for
Germany's 1.8 million civil servants to pay part of their own pension
contributions in future. Kanther's plan envisages that, instead of
receiving 0.2 per cent of their pay increase, civil servants will pay
the money into a special fund, so that a total of DM 66 million, which
will ensure their pensions, will be collected between 2001 and 2015.
Kanther rejected outright the suggestion that the money might be used
to fill the gap in the federal budget. Several other measures are
planned, including lower starting salaries for civil service trainees,
no longer increasing the extra payments received for additional duties
automatically as salary increases are agreed, and discounting any
extra payments for pension purposes.

OeTV union to fight civil servants' pension plan
</H1>
The OeTV trade union intends to stop plans by Manfred Kanther,
the Minister of the Interior, which were approved by the government
this afternoon, to force civil servants to pay contributions for their
own pensions. A parliamentary bill to this effect is expected by
September, at which point Kanther intends to set up negotiations with
the OeTV to agree similar proposals for other workers both in the
public and private sectors.

Most political parties welcome results of EU summit
</H1>
The political parties represented in the Bundestag
have generally welcomed the results of the Amsterdam EU summit. The
CDU/CSU and the FDP stressed the importance of the economic stability
pact agreed for the Euro and said that this represents a great step on
the way to a unified Europe. The most important result for the SPD and
the trade unions, however, was the agreement reached on an active
employment policy. Buendis 90/The Greens and the PDS said that the
summit had proved to be a disappointment and representatives of
industry and commerce also voiced certain reservations.

CDU/CSU and FDP discussions on how to solve current financial crisis
</H1>
The leaders of the CDU/CSU and the FDP held discussions today on
how the current budget crisis might be solved. The leader of the FDP
parliamentary party, Solms, said that he was optimistic about the
chances of success and that he was sure that the coalition would solve
the problems well. According to Wolfgang Gerhardt, the leader of the
FDP, DM 20 billion must be found for this year alone. The government
has agreed in principle to plug this budget gap without resorting to
raising taxes; instead it should be made up by a programme of spending
cuts, privatisation and through taking out new borrowings.

Cabinet finalises proposals for pension reform
</H1>
The federal cabinet has finalised proposals for the pension
reform. From 1999 the pension level will sink from the present 70 per
cent to 64 per cent and the rates for people who are unable to work
will be lowered by 10 per cent on average. The SPD intends to use its
majority in the Bundesrat to stop the bill, which also has provisions
to tighten the present criteria for qualification for a pension for
those unable to work and for a further DM 15 billion to be paid to the
pension agencies from the federal budget. This money will likely be
raised through an increase in excise duty. The SPD has said that it
totally rejects the government's plans, as they would result in
bringing down many pensioners' income to the level of income support.
Rudolf Dressler, a spokesman for the SPD on social affairs who
recently presented his own plans for the pension reform, announced
that the SPD would turn pension policy into a major election issue if
the government did not amend some of its proposals.

Employers: cut unemployment assistance to make jobs more attractive

Employers representatives have proposed that unemployment

DGB against proposal for pension reform
</H1>
The DGB (German federation of trade unions) has announced
that it considers the governments plans for the pension reform to be
unacceptable. The leader of the DGB, Ursula Engelen-Kefer, said that
neither the reduction in the pension rates or the attacks on pensions
for those unable to work could be accepted, and she complained that
several elements had been ignored, such as the extension of pensions
to those who had little work or were self employed.

Workers on job creation programmes have no right to normal pay
</H1>
The Federal Labour Court in Kassel has decided that workers on
job creation programmes have no right to the rates agreed for normal
pay scales, and employers are allowed to pay them less than their
colleagues who are on permanent contracts. The court decided that
posts created through job creation programmes were always set up in
addition to normal posts and so they benefit the unemployed and the
labour market. This justifies lower than normal rates of pay.

Protests against gang violence
</H1>
Parents and their children held a protest today against
increasing violence in Wiesmohr (sp?), East Frisia. School children in
the town have been terrorised for months by a gang of ten youths who
are too young to be prosecuted. The police admits that it is powerless
to do anything apart from taking down reports, processing them, and
passing them on to the public prosecutor's office which then informs
the youth welfare department, whose hands, however, are also tied. The
minister of education and cultural affairs for Lower Saxony called on
the teachers involved to find a sensible middle course between the
best educational theory and the degree of severity which is necessary,
but this will hardly affect the teachers at Wiesmohr comprehensive
school. Since the two leaders of the gang, an 11 year old and a 13
year old who originate from the Lebanon, were suspended from school
for three months, they have never come back. The attacks on school
children have happened outside of school and so the teachers are
powerless to do anything.

27th Protestant church congress
</H1>
A row has broken out over possible contacts that priests from
the former East Germany had with the Stasi (the former East Germany
secret service). The congress is taking place in eastern Germany for
the first time since the re-unification and a key theme at the
congress is 'east meets west' and 'west meets east'. Seven years after
the German re-unification occurred, discussions are also planned on
what role the Protestant church played in the communist GDR. The
church's role as mediator between the state and the people will be
stressed but so will the fact that some members were fellow travellers
with the communists and some were political criminals. The motto of
the congress is 'The way to justice is life'. Over 3,000 discussions
will be held, involving such topics as unemployment, the problems of
achieving equal distribution on earth and the status of the church.
