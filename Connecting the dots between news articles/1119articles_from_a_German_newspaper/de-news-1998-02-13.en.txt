Parliament passes law on universities and electorate reform
</H1>
Parliament passed a new general law on tertiary institutions with the
governing parties' votes (CDU/CSU and FDP). The SPD and the Greens had voted
against it, as they had not prevailed asking for a ban on study-fees in all
federal states. Now they will try and shoot it down in the Upper House
(Bundesrat) and subsequently invoke the Mediation Committee between the two
houses.

<P>
A streamlined organisation, performance checks on lecturers, internationally
recognised degrees at German universities - all these items were passed by
government today. But that's not the end of the story - by a long chalk.
The SPD will not vote for it in the Upper House as the law does not ban
fees. According to Federal Minister of Education Ruettgers that was pure
electioneering on the SPD's part: "That sort of politics is hurting our
universities and our students." Mr Ruettgers' plan to bypass the Upper House
drew a lot of criticism from the opposition parties, and they already
announced they would go to the Federal Constitutional Court in case that
happened. The Rhineland-Palatinate minister of education Juergen Zoellner,
of the SPD, detailed why they would go to court: "The states will have to
foot the bill, whereas federal government passes the law on their own. This
would fly in the face of the current practice." If government reiterated
that they did not want fees, they might as well write that into the law,
according to the opposition parties. Bavaria begged to differ: Bavaria was
against study-fees for a first degree, but it would be up to the states to
decide on that.

<P>
Parliament had another contentious item on their agenda: reshaping of
electorates. Both sides agreed that there should be less electorates, though
they could not agree on how to achieve that. The number of electorates is to
drop to 299 (from 328), resulting in 58 less members of parliament.
According to government changes are "meant to correct errors of the past".
Opposition members, however, claim that "government did away with electorates
won by the SPD in the last federal election, for example Munich City.
The new electorates will be not be used before 2002.

Metal Workers' Union for change of government
</H1>
The Metalworkers' Union (IG Metall) was for a change in government, and they
will push that via ads in newspapers and cinemas. The items unemployment
and social justice will take centre-stage.

<P>
"The country needs reforms that encourage people and create less social
chill", but the union will not drop names. "We don't ask government to
perform miracles, and that's also true for the battle against unemployment.
But we want a fundamental change in politics favouring employment and
equalising the burden. The union would not rely on Mr Kohl's government, as
they had so far indulged in social demolition, making sure workers had less
rights but no more jobs either. And the rich got richer instead.
Workers had to pay up at the tax-office, through tax on wages coming out of
their pay-packets, whereas most companies were millionaires hardly paying any
tax through elaborate tax-saving schemes." Mr Zwickel, of the union,
asked the opposition parties to come up with more concrete concepts as far
as the labour market was concerned, but he did not want to heap more
criticism mainly on the SPD-party
