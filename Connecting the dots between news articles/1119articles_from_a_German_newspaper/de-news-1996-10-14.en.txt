National convention of DAG starts today
</H1>
The 16th national convention of the DAG (national union of employees) started
in Magdeburg today under the slogan "Create work, maintain the welfare state,
create a change". The five-day deliberations will focus on the future policy of
the DAG and the election of the board of directors. Another subject will be the
future of the welfare state. 
<P>
Chancellor Kohl spoke to approximately 200
delegates in that regard. He warned the employers not to break current
collective wage agreements in the dispute about sick pay, saying that it had
not been the government's intention to interfere with valid wage contracts when
it introduced new legal regulations.
<P>
Prior to that, Kohl hat told a newspaper that he rejected criticism by the
employers of the metal industry that they had not received enough support from
the government during the dispute. Cuts in social benefits are necessary to
keep Germany globally competitive, according to Kohl. He announced the
introduction of a bill for the reform of the social safety systems for March
1997. 
<P>
The DAG emphasized that it will defend the welfare state with all its
resources. DAG leader Roland Issen warned against a cancellation of the
national collective wage agreements. He told Inforadio Berlin that the
employers should carefully consider if they want to destroy the proven system
and continue the conflicts in their companies.

Herzog: Don't lose contact with the development in communication technology
</H1>
German president Herzog warned against losing contact with the development and
marketing of modern communication technologies. At the opening ceremony of the
Munich Media Days, Herzog said that Germany has to use its opportunities to
achieve an international leading position as an information location. Herzog

communication. He is convinced that electronic communication will broaden and
complement the personal exchange. Herzog said that it is necessary to prepare
the youth for the new cultural technology. They should not just learn how to
operate a computer, but also how to handle the increasing amount of data.

New negotiations regarding tax law amendment
</H1>
No sign of a compromise is visible prior to the start of the new
negotiations between the coalition and the social democrats in regard to the
tax law amendment 1997. The SPD made clear that it insists on the agreed
increase in child benefits and might agree to the abolition of the capital tax
for companies; the government coalition still intends to enforce the complete
abolition for private assets as well. The parliamentary party leader of the
coalition, Schaeuble, said that the coalition, if necessary, will decide alone
about bills that can be passed without the SPD's agreement. The negotiations
are headed by the federal minister of finance, Waigel, and the mayor of
Hamburg, Voscherau.

Government plans to increase pensions for mothers
</H1>
The minister of employment, Bluem, plans to apply four instead of the
current three years per child to increase mothers' old age pensions, according
to a newspaper report. This would result in an increase of the monthly pension
for mothers from currently DM46 to DM57 per child. The new regulation will
probably be part of the planned pension reform. The proposal is supported by
the CDU politicians Rita Suessmuth and Heiner Geissler.
