Second day of CDU federal party convention in Leipzig
</H1>
The CDU party has called for new areas of employment as a way out
of mass unemployment. During the debate of the key motion for
employment, education, the future and Europe, Mr Schmold, the chairman of
the chemical trade union, said that Germany has to expect an increase in the
unemployment rate to up to 4.5 million next year. Being a guest speaker at
the CDU convention, Mr Schmold demanded to improve the dialogue of all
political
parties. He is willing to try once again to form an alliance between
politicians, employers and trade unions. The secretary-general of the CDU/CSU
faction in the Bundestag (lower house of parliament), Mr Hoerster, said in
Leipzig, that the CDU/CSU parties intend to reduce the number in [or abolish]
610DM-jobs [for certain part-time jobs jobs that earn less than DM610/months,
neither employers nor employees have to pay social security contributions]
before the federal elections in autumn 1998. Federal Minister of Employment
Norbert Bluem defended the project. He said that the insurance-free jobs
gives
employers the possibility to avoid paying social security contributions of
the
employees [vs true part-time jobs that also provide for social security of
the
employees]. Instead, a few new employment areas for less qualified people
should be created.

Other parties' reaction to CDU convention
</H1>
The FDP welcomed the programmatic development of the party's coalition
partner CDU as presented at the party's federal party convention in Leipzig.
FDP Secretary-general Guido Westerwelle said the Liberals, too, aim for a
leaner State with an increased self-responsibility of its citizens.

<P>
Today's reaction of the Social democrats to the discussions in Leipzig is
again
critical. The SPD Member of Parliament, Mr Mueller, accused the CDU of
cowardice, ignorance and personality cult. The reformers known as 'The Young
Wild' were in reality 'tame go-getters'. The Green party reckons that there
are
no signals for any labour market changes and for youth' chances for the
future.

Germany satisfies deficit criteria for EMU this year
</H1>
Germany has got good chances this year to satisfy the criteria for
taking part in the European Monetary Union. In its Autumn forecast the EU
commission estimates the federal budget deficit to be exactly at 3% of the
gross national product this year, and at 2.6 % next year. Except for France
and
Greece, all other European countries will be able to satisfy the criteria.
With
a national debt of 61.8% of the GNP, Germany will slightly exceed the limit
of
60%, according to the forecast. German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said
these
numbers are proof for the succes of his work.

Huge decrease in German retail trade revenues
</H1>
In August, the german retail trade has suffered the highest
decrease
in revenues in this century. The Federal Statistics Department reported an 8%
decline in revenues in the retail sector, compared to August last year.
Clothing
shops, mail-order businesses and furniture shops are most affected. It is now
more and more unlikely that retailers will be able to reach the revenue level
of 1997.

Fees for credit card usage abroad legal
</H1>
Banks are allowed to charge customers an extra fee for using
a credit card abroad, according to a ruling of the Federal High
Court. This new ruling squashes an earlier decision of the Hamburg
Higher Regional Court. Following a complaint of consumer rights
groups, the Higher Regional Court had ruled the fee illegal
for the reason that the usage abroad should be included in the annual
fee for the credit card already. The Federal High Court's ruling,
however, leaves it entirely to the credit card issuers to set the
terms of the contract.

Lawsuit against several tourists starts
</H1>
In the Austrian town of Salzburg, a lawsuit against several
tourists started today. The tourists are charged with having shown their
bottom to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl two years ago. Several police
officers who testified as witnesses were not able to say who of the
defendants had taken part in the action. Consequently, the lawsuit
has been adjourned.

<P>
At the Wolfgangsee lake in 1995, the young people allegedly have pulled
down their swimming trunks in front of Mr and Ms Kohl. They had been
fined between DM310 and DM620, and then filed an appeal against the fines.
