Talks about extending EU-membership
</H1>
This afternoon the European heads of state met in Luxemburg and began talks
about extending the EU. Most members were for starting talks about the
future membership of Poland, Hungary, Czechia, Slovenia, Cyprus and Estonia
next spring. The other East European states, who missed out this time, are to
get additional support by the EU, to facilitate economic and political
adjustments in order to make them more eligible in the future.

Parliament sets up committee against right-wing radicalism in Armed Forces
</H1>
In mid-January a parliamentary committee will look into neo-nazi Roeder's
appearance at the Armed Forces Executive Training School, and other
right-wing radical happenings in the more recent past. The committee is to
have their first set-up session on 14 January, and that is also when
the scope will be defined in detail. As requested by the SPD and the
Greens/Alliance, parliament's defence committee voted to do the job
themselves.

Things looking up in 1997 as far as apprenticeships are concerned
</H1>
Thinks looked positive for 1997, as far as apprenticeships were concerned,
according to Federal Education Minister Ruettgers. Until 30 September, more
than 580,000 apprenticeships had been created (up 2.3%), meaning a reversal
of the existing trends. Industry and trades had kept their promise, so
there was no need to even think about a levy the SPD had favoured (hitting
employers who did not train apprentices).

IFO-Institute presents economic forecast 1998
</H1>
Today the Munich IFO Institute for Economic Research published their economic
forecast. Currently the pundits have a hard time predicting anything more
tangible, as Asia's turmoil causes everything to be out of kilter. The Munich
based institute, however, is optimistic as far as next year is concerned.
Growth will be somewhat lower than originally predicted last autumn. At the
time, all six leading forecasting institutes had predicted Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) to grow at 3.0%. That was revised down to 2.6% now. For
the first time this sort of growth is expected to do some good for the
unemployed. The end of the major redundancies would have been reached, so
more employment would also mean more domestic consumer spending.

Trial of Mr Schneider in decisive phase
</H1>
The trial of real-estate tycoon Schneider entered a decisive phase at the
Frankfurt Regional Court. The public prosecutor is convinced Mr Schneider
caused millions of marks worth of damage by wilfully and expressly
defrauding people and institutions. He pleaded for 7 years and nine months
jail for loan-fraud and aggravated fraud. For years Mr Schneider almost had
turned fraud into a business, cheating banks and working on the assumption
that they were too ignorant or lazy to check out his schemes.

<P>
Next Tuesday and Wednesday the defendants most likely will plead
differently, that is his lawyer and the co-defendant Heinrich Kuepferle.
Mr Kuepferle, who forged plans for his boss, according to the prosecution,
was not the big mover and shaker in the fraud business. He is to get 9
months suspended plus a 5,000 mark fine, for having been an accessory.

Man from Turkey severely beaten by right-wing radical youths
</H1>
In Eberswalde/Brandenburg right-wing radical youths attacked a man from
Turkey causing grievous bodily harm. According to the police, they used a
baseball bat, so for a while the victim was in a critical condition. A
German national, who had waited at a bust stop just like the victim, was
also hurt. Shortly after the attack had occurred, police arrested 5 young
persons.

<P>
Last night there had been another attack, on a home for immigrants near
Eberswalde. Persons unknown had thrown Molotov cocktails through windows of
a home for Jewish immigrants in Schoenerlinde. The people living there,
however, were able to put out the fire, so no-one was hurt.
