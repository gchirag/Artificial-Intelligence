Greens and SPD agree on delivery of sample tank to Turkey
</H1>
Buendnis90/Gruene still consider the delivery of a Leopard II tank
to Turkey a wrong decision, said executive spokesperson Gunda Roestel.
Tonight, SPD and Greens have resolved their dispute about the tank
delivery. SPD faction leader Peter Struck said the coalition was not in
danger. Now, SPD and Greens want to tighten rules for arms exports.
According to the Greens the most important criterion should be the
adherence to the Human Rights. Faction spokesperson Kerstin Mueller said,
that was also a requirement for admitting Turkey to the EU. The PDS
criticized the Greens' giving in on the sample tank question the
slaughtering of a sacred cow. The PDS member of parliament Heidi Lippmann
Kasten said those who engaged in a war in Kosovo on behalf of the human
rights apparently now also are allowed to deliver tanks to enforce the
human rights. CDU and CSU reproached the government with on the one hand
offering Turkey candidate status for joining the European Union and on the
other hand questioning the co-operation when it comes to a small arms
export.
