Illegal demonstrations on the anniversary of Hess' death
</H1>
About 200 right wing demonstrators, along with about 50
counterdemonstrators, gathered today at the Neumarkt, near the Worms
Cathedral. They assembled there for an illegal commemoration of the death
of Hitler's lieutenant, Hess. 150 police circled the demonstrators with
the assignment of arresting all of them immediately and removing them from
Worms. In the course of this action, 160 Neonazis were taken and a great
deal of propaganda, baseball bats and chains were seized.
<P>

In other cities, there were gatherings of the radical right, and, on those
grounds. police arrested nearly 300 Neonazis, 30 from Hessen and 7 from the
Upper Franconia section of Bavaria. In Baden-Wuerttemberg 29 Nazi
sympathizers were taken into custody, and in the Saarland the Federal
border patrol turned roughly 20 rightists back at the German-French
border. Most of these radicals were from France or the Netherlands, but
there were Germans among them as well.
<P>
On the occasion of the death of Hitler's deputy Hess, there were 20
applications for demonstration permits in the entire federal Republic.
All were denied.
<P>
In southern Sweden several hundred rightists created a riot among
themselves, counterdemonstrators and the police, during which bottles and
rocks flew. The Neonazis came from Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Germany.
Swedish authorities had authorized the demonstration, but not that of the
counterdemonstrators.

Dispute over tax reform
</H1>
Politicians of the ruling parties are carrying out their debate about
tax reform in interviews. Finance Minister Waigel told the Bildzeitung
that the reform would not be implemented until 1999. FDP leader
Gerhardt informed the paper Welt am Sonntag that his party would enact
parts of the reform as early as 1998. Chancellery Office Minister
Bohl declared on Radio Free Berlin that the tax reform would be activated
no later than January 1, 1999. The dispute is over the details of
the plan to lower the salary tax and the income tax and to dismantle tax
benefits, while raising the value-added tax. The FDP will only agree to a
higher VAT if social benefits are lowered, a move that Finance minister
Waigel refused.

Crush of returning traffic creates gigantic traffic jam
</H1>
Travelers returning from the North caused a traffic jam on the
Hamburg-Flensburg highway. For 100 KM autos were stopped, and those who
managed to get beyond that were confronted with a 25 KM long jam at the
entrance to the Hamburg Elbe tunnel. The flood of returning travelers was
caused by the coinciding end of summer vacation in North Rhine-Westphalia and
the Netherlands, as well as the end of factory holidays in several auto
firms.
