Mr Kinkel signs friendship-treaty
</H1>
It took two years of word-smithing, and the contents remain controversial,
but German and Czechoslovakian foreign ministers agreed on the
friendship-treaty in Prague, putting past conflicts behind them.
Czechoslovakia's minister said that the main pillars of distrust and fear
had been razed.

<P>
There was a bit of festivity in romantic snow-clad Prague, and both
ministers were visibly relieved that the wording now had been set in stone.
Mr Kinkel said that this was a historical day for both countries. "Europe's
heart beats on the Wenceslaw Square, in Prague, just as much as in Berlin
and Paris or London. Our two cultures have profited from each other,
together with the jews'. Unfortunately some things are lost forever."
Today's achievements, that is the friendship-treaty, would be irrevocable.
Next year, both heads of state will sign the treaty, and Chancellor Kohl
will travel to Prague for that reason. Then both countries' parliaments
will have to ratify the document, something both parties take for granted.

Mr Rexrodt on unemployment
</H1>
Yesterday the Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt fuer Arbeit) made a
dramatic appeal to government, business associations and unions to get
together and fight high unemployment. By now, high unemployment would be
sapping the base of our democratic society. Economics Minister Rexrodt also
put his oar in: he expected the number of unemployed to top the
4 million mark this winter. However, government would stick to the ambitious
goal of halving unemployment until the year 2000. He mentioned ten areas
government would be concentrating on next year, including the reform of
income-tax and statutory pension scheme. He also wanted to privatise
institutions such as ports, airports and roads, as of 1997, and wanted to
create jobs in the service-industry. So far he had not heard of any
alternatives to the proposals put forward by government.

SFOR-deployment begins in Bosnia-Herzegovina
</H1>
Today SFOR-troops began their mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They are
relieving IFOR-contingents who had been keeping an eye on the realisation
of the Dayton accord for the last year. Germany sent more than 3,000
soldiers to help them. Today Defence Minister Ruehe thanked all German
soldiers and civilians who had taken part in the first mission. He
emphasised that the German soldiers, who had been a part of the international
peace-keeping-contingent, had made an important contribution to the
peace-keeping efforts in the area.

Child abusers: not guilty
</H1>
At the first of three child-abuse trials at the Mainz Regional Court,
all six accused were found not guilty. Judge Beutel said that there had not
been enough evidence to convict the four men and two women.
Mainly the children's testimony was not acceptable. It contained a
mixture of truth and imagination, to a degree where even experienced judges
would be unable to determine what really had happened. And the children had
been subject to extensive outside influence. However, the court believed that
at least some of the children had been subjected to sexual abuse. The public
prosecutor had asked for jail-terms of 8 to 14 years, for sexual abuse of
dependents (sons, daughters, nieces and nephews). This had been the biggest
child-abuse trial in post-war Germany so far, with a total of 13 men
and 11 women taken to court.

No more investigations against Daimler CEO's
</H1>
The Stuttgart public prosecutor put paid to investigations against
Daimler-Benz executives, who were alleged to have made false statements
concerning the company's expected profit. According to a spokes-person for
the prosecutor's office, the evidence had not been corroborated. At the time,
there was no way losses could have been foreseen. During the 1995 AGM in
May, shareholders had accused management of having kept risks to the annual
profits secret, on purpose. Instead of the then projected profit,
Daimler-Benz had sustained losses to the tune of 5.7 billion marks.

Grundig ceases to make TV-sets in Germany
</H1>
Grundig AG wants to cease making TV-sets in Germany as of 1998,
according to a spokes-person for the company. The Nuernberg-Langwasser plant's
production is to be moved to Vienna and Hungary, causing concern for 560
jobs. Grundig, however, would be planning to keep the workers employed
at the existing Nuernberg-Langwasser plant.
