New head of German Protestant Church criticizes unemployment policies
</H1>
The new chairman of the German Protestant Church, Kock (sp?) has
criticized the measures heretofore undertaken to battle unemployment. He
said it was too easy to put people off with the declared intention to try
to halve the number of unemployed by the year 2000. He also said that a
solution to this problem could only be reached if every part of the
society was functioning and mobilized. Kock added that the church would
therefore not simply speak comforting words, but rather would stick its
finger in the open wounds. He continued that even the current proviso,
that any measure should only be undertaken if it is reasonably sure to
meet with some success, deserves to be questioned at this point.
Kock, the leader of the church for the Rhineland area, was named chairman
of the German Protestant Church today, replacing the retiring Bishop
Engelhard (sp?).

4.29 million unemployed in October
</H1>
Unemployment levels in Germany remain high. Jagoda, the president of the
Federal Labour Office, announced today that there were 4.29 million
unemployed people in Germany in October. That figure is actually down by
17,800 from the previous month, but up by 423,000 over a year ago. In the
East, the numbers translate to a rate of 18.2 percent, almost double that
in the West. Jagoda did speak of a slight stabilization in the labour
market, but added that a sustained recovery was not to be expected within
the next year. Government spokesman Haussmann, on the other hand,
indicated that he was convinced that 1998 would see a significant
turn-around.

Herzog's education reform speech gets mixed reviews
</H1>
Federal President Herzog's call for basic reforms to the education system
has been met with mixed responses. His speech was largely approved of by
the parties, opposed by the Education Ministers' Conference. The president
of the Conference, Wernstedt (sp?), said that Herzog's speech advocated
many projects which are already in progress. But Baden-Wuerttemberg's
Sciences Minister von Trotha said that institutions of higher learning did
indeed need some modernization; the changes to the Higher Education Law
recently passed were not nearly sufficient.
Herzog today called for a national debate on the future of the education
system. He is calling form more practical application, shorter terms of
study, and more competition.

EU Commission threatens Bertelsmann, Kirch, and Telekom with fines
</H1>
The EU Commission has threatened the media companies Bertelsmann, and
Kirch, as well as the Telekom with heavy fines. Competition Commissioner
van Miert (sp?) warned the companies today against proceeding with their
digital television joint-venture without waiting first for EU approval.
The Commission will investigate whether the companies have already
implemented part of a merger without registering it in Brussels. If they
have, they could face fines of up to 10 percent of their yearly incomes.
The Commission has the right to examine company mergers, to see if they
could lead to the misuse of a dominant market position.

Scientists achieve break-through in mad cow disease
</H1>
Scientists from Switzerland and Germany have experienced a break-through
in their research into mad cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease.
According to a report in the British science magazine "Nature", they have
developed an antibody to test directly for diseased prions. The
development will allow, for the first time, testing on living organisms.
The antibody is expected to be significant in the development of future
therapies for prion diseases. Intensive efforts to develop such an
antibody have been underway all over the world since the early 1980s, but
until now the presence of the mutated protein which plays a role in mad
cow disease and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease could only be detected
indirectly.

No double compensation for forced labourers in Third Reich
</H1>
Those forced into labour in Germany under the Nazis are not entitled to
further recompense. The Regional Court in Bonn made the precedent-setting
ruling today. The lawyer for the plaintiff, Klaus von Muenchhausen (sp?)
called the decision the worst possible solution, and filed an appeal. The
federal government and the finance ministry welcomed the ruling. According
to the court, additional compensation is only possible if an individual
has not yet received any compensation under the Federal Compensation Law,
either in the form of lump-sum or pension payments.
The judges granted a woman from Poland over DM 15,000 in compensation,
because she could not make good her claims in time.
