Swedish protest against bombing of Belgrade embassy
</H1>
Heavy NATO attacks during last night have again led to diplomatic
trouble,
for once more, civilian targets were hit. Sweden presented a forceful
protest
because their ambassador's residence was hit. Main point of the
complaints
is that NATO uses bombs with a large damage perimeter around the main
target. This happened at a hospital last night. According to Serbian
sources,
NATO fighter bombers hit the maternity ward of a clinic center,
killing at least
three patients and injuring two expectant mothers. It is feared that
additional
victims may turn up under the wreckage. The hospital is situated
close to
a military barracks area and has repeatedly suffered hits during the
8-week
operation. Other targets of last night's attacks were Danica air base
and a
chemical plant at Baric, south of Belgrade.

Bundesbank draws gloomy picture of German economy
</H1>
Germany's federal bank Bundesbank still takes a recessional view of
the country's economy. In their latest monthly report, the chief aim
of
criticism is excessive increases in wage scale agreements.
Furthermore,
the unresolved questions in tax and economic policies might have a
stifling effect on economic growth. The chairman of the "5 wise men"
of
the economy called for a significant tax reduction with a top rate of
40%
for all income categories. He also suggested that a close look be
taken
at social services. He suggests that state subsidies such as "child
money"
should be graded according to necessity, in other words, according
to income. In his opinion the economy has been badly shaken by
federal government action over the last few months.

Commemoration at the Maximilianeum
</H1>
Bavaria's state parliament, in a memorial ceremony, remembered the
debates
that led to the German Basic Law (constitution) exactly 50 years ago.
Bavaria was the only state whose parliament voted against adopting the
Basic Law. They wanted to avoid a new round of centralization and did
not see sufficient safeguards for states' rights in the constitution.
Premier Stoiber stressed that this had not been an expression of
Bavarian
separatism. He praised the Basic Law as a constitution that continued
to be up to date.

New expertise on ICE smashup at Enschede
</H1>
A new expertise has been presented on the Eschede ICE disaster.
The Darmstadt based Fraunhofer Institute concluded that the accident
was
caused by lack of adequate controls and an overstressed wheel. The
steel tire
of the wheel in question had been fragmented by stress. Before that
happened,
a fissure of the wheel from the center outward had occurred. This
fissure
could have been detected, had there been a control procedure, but this
was
not used by the Railway company. There was no sign of a material or
manufacturing fault, according to the experts.
