</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder thinks that a quick realisation of the Kosovo
peace-plan is possible. When interviewed on TV ZDF, he said that an agreement
on the Kosovo security resolution could happen as early as this Sunday, when
the G8 Foreign Ministers are going to meet in Bonn. UN General Secretary
Annan said in New York that the Security Council would look into the
resolution at the beginning of next week. He asked his special envoys Bildt
and Kukan to set up a conference in Geneva, to wrap up the Kosovo crisis.

NATO-generals to meet Serbian counterparts
</H1>
Following the backing of the Kosovo peace-resolution by the Yugoslavian
government, NATO will take first steps to it realisation as early as
Saturday. NATO-general Jackson will meet Yugoslavian generals at the Kosovo
border. They will talk about the nitty-gritty of troop-withdrawals, which
according to the resolution have to be finished within seven days. Germany
supposedly will send more armed forces to join the planned Kosovo
peace-corps than originally planned. According to secretary Wichert, there
could be some 1000 additional soldiers.

No more air-raids on Serbian metropolitan centres
</H1>
NATO stopped air-raids on Belgrade and Serbian metropolitan centres; they
had not been targets for Friday night's sorties, according to NATO sources.
Attacks against Serbian troops, however, had not slowed down. And apart from
that, a headquarter of the special police and an airport had been bombed.
France's head of state Chirac declared that from now on NATO would confine
air-raids to military targets. Meanwhile the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)
declared that Serbian armed forces had started a new offensive in the
Kosovo.

Chancellor Schroeder: Agreement on Balkans can be finalised in June
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder thinks that the planned stability agreement for the
Balkans could be finalised and signed in June. At the end of the EU-summit
meeting in Cologne, Mr Schroeder said that the agreement, initiated by
Germany, should provide long-term stability to the region. The states
in the region, the EU, the US and Russia as well as international
organisations should join. The agreement provides for aid to the Balkans
and closer ties with the EU.

No more duty-free shopping within the EU at the end of this month
</H1>
As planned, duty-free shopping within the EU will cease at the end of
this month. During the EU-summit meeting, a majority had been for an
extension of the current system, but this was vetoed by the Netherlands and
Denmark. The heads of state also agreed on a resolution to reduce
unemployment. Main issues of the agreement are co-ordination of economic
policies and a joint strategy to improve labour markets and the base for
innovation.
