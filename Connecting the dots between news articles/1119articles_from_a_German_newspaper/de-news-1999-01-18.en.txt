No compensation for quitting nuclear energy
</H1>
The German Government will not admit any compensation being paid for
quitting nuclear energy. Chancellor Schroeder said today "As far as I
know these contracts, there is no reason to consider any compensation
demands of French companies or the French State. We will not let it come
to any compensation. This is part of the coalition contracts and will be
strictly obeyed." The Frenchmen still demand a compensation in the case
that German nuclear waste will not be reprocessed in France anymore. The
Britons argue the same way.

</H1>
The Federal Government wants the new citizenship law come into effect in
autumn. Probably by the end of March, the Federal Cabinet will pass the
bill for the new citizenship law. According to the SPD-parliamentary
party leader, Struck, there will be no changes to the bill of the
Minister of the Interior, Schily. Struck reacted upon critical comments
from the Greens. Their demand is that also people, receiving social and
unemployment benefits, shall enjoy the double citizenship. Struck
reasoned the cancellation with financial situation of the
municipalities. In the meantime, only in Hessen the CDU collected last
weekend 45,000 signatures against the double citizenship. This week, the
CDU in Rhineland-Palatine will join this action.

Possibility of an earlier Introduction of the Euro-cash
</H1>
According to EU-circles, an earlier introduction of the Euro-cash is
possible. Legally the 11 countries of the Euro-zone have to decide this
unanimously on the basis of a proposal of the EU-commission. In a few
months, a change of the schedule could be successful with great
political will. So far the introduction of the Euro-cash is scheduled
for January 2002. Several European Financial Ministers expressed their
opinion for an earlier introduction. The president of the EU-commission,
Santer, basically welcomed this. But some technical questions still have
to be settled.

Health resorts in Baden-Wuerttemberg still within a crisis
</H1>
After the health insurance reform, the mineral baths and health resorts
in Baden-Wuerttemberg still have to struggle for survival. This said the
Minister of Economics, Doering, on the tourist fair CMT in Stuttgart.
Instead of a rising number of overnight stays, there might happen
additional closures of hospitals and the loss of jobs. "We are on the
way of recovery, but it is still a long way to go that we can relax in
our armchair and call this crisis overcome. That means, we do not only
have to wait for patients on prescription, but also for private
patients." For this year, Doering announced a support programme for
health resorts.
