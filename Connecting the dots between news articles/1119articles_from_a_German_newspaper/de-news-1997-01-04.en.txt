Cold wave continues in Europe
</H1>
The cold wave in Europe continues unabated. Thousands of
drivers in France were again stuck in winter driving conditions. The region
around Chateaux Roux on the Paris-Rouen Highway was especially hard hit. Train
travel was also affected again. No trains will travel today from Lyon to either
Marseilles or Montpellier. German Railways (DB) is allowing the homeless to stay
in train stations temporarily, as well as in those which are normally closed.
Winter weather and traffic snarls are expected, especially in the south of
Germany, where with the exception of Baden-Wuerttemberg the Christmas holidays
are ending.

Schaeuble appeals to the social resposibility of companies
</H1>
The leader of the union faction in the Bundestag, Schaeuble, appealed today to
the social responsibility of businesses in the fight against unemployment.
Entrepreneurial activity does not consist solely of short-term profit
maximization, Schaeuble emphasized early this morning on "Deutschlandfunk".
Political action can only define the general aims. Employers and unions must
then appreciate their respective responsibilities, Schaeuble explained. The CDU
politician stood firmly against a devaluation of the German standard of living,
as good now as it has ever been. Such a description would be foolish, he said.
On the question of a possible candidacy for Chancellor Schaeuble would not comment, and said this was not a question to be answered at this time.

Rexrodt against new round of talks for the Union For Work
</H1>
Federal economic minister Rexrodt rejected a restart of the council round for a
Union For Work (BFA) as long as unions were placing conditions. With preconditions no progress can take place, Rexrodt told the news magazine "FOCUS". The
chief representitives for the political, business and union spheres can agree on
guidelines without them, he said. Concrete unifications for work are only possible in factories and between contracting parties, the FDP politician
emphasized.

Kohl meets with Yeltsin in Moscow
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Kohl met today with the Russian President Yeltsin.
The first meeting for Yeltsin with a western leader since his recuperation from
a severe heart operation was set to last three to four hours. The federal
government reported that the topic at the meeting would be the future European
security structure. That would include the eastward expansion of NATO,
advocated by the West. Russia has rejected this expansion to this point. After
the three hour conference Yeltsin reported that Germany and Russia would
conduct a dialogue on this theme. A solution for the NATO problem was sought by
both sides. As reported by the news agency Interfax Yeltsin agreed to travel to
Germany in April. There in Baden-Baden he will accept the German media prize
already awarded to him.

Lamers for support of Russia during troop reductions
</H1>
The foreign policy speaker for the union faction in the Bundestag, Lamers,
declared himself to be for a greater support of Russia in its planned troop
reduction. The inner condition of the army is a cause for great care, and
nothing would be so dangerous as a ruin of the Russian armed forces, Lamers
said this morning on "Deutschlandradio Berlin". The Russians do indeed want
troop reductions, but have nonetheless great fears for the social consequences.
A financial show of support for this preference would be in the interests of the
west as well, Lamers emphasized.

Ruehe consults with U.S. politicians about security matters
</H1>
The federal defense minister Ruehe addressed the difficulty of convincing Russia
of the necessity of the eastern expansion of NATO on the commencement of his
one week visit to the USA. The minister said it was important to notify the
U.S. government and Congress in the early stages of the planned opening of the
alliance in the summer. On the invitation of his retiring American colleague
William Perry, defense minister Ruehe began his visit to the USA yesterday.
After discussions with governmental and congressional politicians Ruehe
emphasized the great concurrence on questions of eastern NATO expansion, a new
dialogue with Russia and the Ukraine, and on the evaluation of the situation in
Bosnia. U.S. Senator Lugar agreed with Ruehe that pressure must be applied to
Serbian President Milosevic to accept the results of the local elections, and
not abate. On the question of possible sanctions there was no discussion. Ruehe,
whose trip also served as preparation for the NATO summit in summer, emphasized
the decisive role of the U.S. and Germany in the opening of the Atlantic union,
and in the overcoming of the division of Europe. The defense minister meanwhile
travelled further, to visit the NATO headquarters in Norfolk, Virginia until
next Wednesday, to observe the training of a German flight wing in Florida and
to give a speech before U.S. cadets in Colorado.

Renewed strife between the CSU and the FDP over the solidarity tax
</H1>
A new debate between the CSU and the FDP has erupted over the solidarity
surtax. Federal finance minister (and CSU leader) Waigel refused to specify a
date for the end of the tax. In the face of this, FDP faction chief Solms
insisted on the revocation of the tax in the year 2000. Waigel replied to that
demand in a radio interview, no one can simultaneously conduct tax reform with
income reductions of 30 billion marks as well as refuse the income from the
solidarity tax. Waigel criticized the FDP for not yet detailing how such an
elimination of the surtax could be financed.

Wissman names requirements for Autobahn fees

Federal traffic minister Wissmann did not essentially deny the introduction of an auto toll in Germany. He told the magazine "FOCUS" that he was no
principled opponent of road use fees. The minister enumerated preconditions:
The monies collected must be used for the construction of traffic fees. A fee
for Autobahns would be enforcable if the truck tax is abolished in 2002 or 2003,
as is now planned.

Union for Child Protection: Right to kindergarten place is overkill
</H1>
The Union for Child Protection today characterized the legal right to
a place in kindergarten from the third year on as overkill. The business leader
of the Union, Wilken, said on "Deutschlandradio" that the Union had not so financially equipped the communities that they could offer a substantial package
that met the children's needs. The danger exists that pedagogical standards
would fall - for example by oversubscription to groups or that personnel would
be used who were either unprepared or not prepared at all.
