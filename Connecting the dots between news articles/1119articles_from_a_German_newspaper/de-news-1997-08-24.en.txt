Government denies report about cabinet reshuffle
</H1>
The Federal Government has denied a report in the tabloid "Bild am
Sonntag" about an imminent cabinet reshuffle. A government spokesman in
Bonn said the report was just one of many false rumours circulating at
this time. The tabloid reported that Chancellor Helmut Kohl was planning
to replace Finance Minister Theo Waigel with CDU chairman Wolfgang
Schaeuble next month. The Minister for the Interior, Manfred Kanther,
and Minister for Building and Construction, Klaus Toepfer, were supposed to
be leaving as well. The report also claimed that the Department of
Construction would be integrated with the Department of Finance, and
that a CSU politician would be entrusted with the Department of the
Interior.

<P>
CSU regional chairman Mr. Glos emphasized that his party would continue
to call for changes within the government.  In an interview with the
newspaper "Frankfurter Rundschau", he said that Chancellor Helmut Kohl
had decided to run again at the insistence of the CSU. However, in order
to be successful in the elections next year, he would have to present a
fresh team. Mr. Glos also said, without the extraordinary achievements
of the CSU in Bavaria, there would be no coalition and no Chancellor
Kohl.

Different signals from SPD over tax issue
</H1>
The Social Democratic Party (SPD) is giving out contradictory signals
about how it intends to proceed in the tax dispute with the coalition.
Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, vice-chairman of the SPD, told the newspaper
"Koelner Express" that further negotiations with Finance Minister Theo
Waigel had been ruled out. SPD chairman Rudolf Scharping, on the other
hand, has pleaded for a quick agreement on a small tax reform. He said
an understanding must be reached on those points which transcend party
differences. Mr. Mai, chairman of the Union for Public Service and
Transportation, warned the Social Democrats against accepting a tax
compromise. The opposition should not approach the coalition on this
issue, he said. Their plans would only lead to new shortfalls in the
budget and further unemployment.

Mr. Henkel criticizes lack of action to improve Germany's position
</H1>
The chairman of the Federal Union of German Industry,  Mr. Henkel, has
reproached major companies for their lack of action to improve Germany's
economic position. In an interview with the economics journal "Impulse",
Mr Henkel said he often felt isolated and that he would like more
support from among his own ranks in the public debate. Employers must
also make themselves heard, he said.  Many industrial managers still go
suddenly quiet, when a politician comes to visit their company.

required until at least October.  However, the number of soldiers
involved (currently 3,000) will be gradually reduced, according to
General Major von Kirchbach. The priority for the coming week will be
the use of heavy machinery to remove damage caused by the flood. In
addition, the dikes will have to be further secured and prepared for the
