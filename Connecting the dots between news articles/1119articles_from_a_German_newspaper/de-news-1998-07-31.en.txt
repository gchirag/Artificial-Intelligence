Another stumbling-block for rescuers at Lassing mine
</H1>
Rescue work at the collapsed mine in Lassing/Austria has been delayed once
again. When using a remotely-operated minicamera in a steel rescue-shaft,
workers discovered that there were cracks in the latter's wall. Management
then decided not to dig any deeper, for the time being, as that could have
caused the whole shaft to collapse. Now existing damage will have to be
repaired. Rescue staff had got as close as 4 metres to the spot where they
expected the miners to have been trapped 2 weeks ago.

<P>
The Styrian rescue team hopes that a special digger from Germany will
cut through the last 4 metres to the (artificial) cave where they expect
the trapped miners. A German army helicopter is to fly it from
Celle/Germany to the mine until 10pm tonight (local time).

<P>
The 10 miners have been trapped for more than 2 weeks now, and though
there are no definite signs that they are still alive, friends and
families of the trapped men are still hoping for another miracle:
Last Sunday trapped miner Georg Hainzl was rescued 10 days after the
mine had collapsed, almost unhurt.

Offenders who disgraced Buchenwald memorial caught
</H1>
The people responsible for disgracing the (concentration camp) memorial
at Buchenwald/Thuringia have been found. According to the state prosecutor
3 young persons from Weimar have admitted to having damaged the memorial
using a metal saw. Obviously there was no political background, as the
offenders allegedly had been heavily intoxicated at the time. They were
caught after citizens' tip-offs.

<P>
The bronze statue by Fritz Kraemer is one of the most known monuments
to the victims of the Nazi-terror, commemorating the liberation of inmates
on 11 April 1945. From 1937 until 1945 approximately 56,000 persons had been
killed at the concentration camp of Buchenwald.

Police catch illegal alien smuggling gang
</H1>
Bavarian police have claimed that they have cracked a gang of 'guides'
responsible for smuggling approximately 1,000 illegal aliens across the
Czechoslovakian border into Germany. Today they stated, in the border
town of Schirnding, that 45 members had been investigated and all but one
had been arrested. They were from Czechoslovakia, Germany and Albania.
Most aliens originated from Afghanistan and the Kosovo region.
Yesterday a truck carrying 27 illegal aliens from Albania/Kosovo had
crashed (in Germany) near the Czechoslovakian border, killing 7 and
injuring 20. The two Czechoslovakian drivers have been arrested, while
a man from Bremerhaven/Germany, who is supposed to be the organiser, had
been set free provided he met certain obligations.

Tour de France: Ullrich stays third
</H1>
Magnus Backstedt/Sweden won leg 19 of the Tour de France, after he
and others sprinted away from the rest of the crowd. The yellow jersey,
however, stays with Marco Patani/Italy who still keeps his global lead over
Bobby Julich/USA and Jan Ullrich/Germany. Mr Erich Zabel keeps the green
jersey, for the time being. The TVM-team from the Netherlands did not
do this leg, after the recent doping scandal, meaning that this run was
down to 14 (out of 21) competitors.
