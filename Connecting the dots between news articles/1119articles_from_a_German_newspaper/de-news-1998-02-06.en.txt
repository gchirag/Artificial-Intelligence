Some critical of amendment of constitution allowing more electronic bugging
</H1>
Business associations and politicians were quite critical of the
amendment of the German Constitution (legalising electronic bugging of
*private* dwellings). A big bone of contention was the planned appeal to the
Mediation Committee, to have another look at how things would work at the
coal-face.
Finance Minister Waigel of the CSU said he would never accept a
watering-down of the original law, and CDU Secretary General Hintze
seconded that. The German Press Council stated that they couldn't understand
how the Upper House (Bundesrat) could have agreed to this severe
infringement on the freedom of the press. The German Bar Association
claimed that this day would have to be German society's Black Friday.
Today a 2/3 majority of the Upper House (Bundesrat) members voted for the
amendment of the constitution, legalising electronic bugging in private
dwellings. Priests, barristers while working for their clients and members
of parliament are to be exempt: they cannot legally be bugged

Upper House (Bundesrat) on benefits for refugees
</H1>
The Upper House (Bundesrat) discussed benefits for people seeking asylum.
They are to be cut once again, to prevent abuse. Berlin's state parliament
proposed a draft-law, and it was passed by the house. People asking for
asylum in Germany will have their benefits reduced if there was proof that
they came to Germany to obtain the benefit.

<P>
There will be no more payment of monies or in kind, and the people
concerned will have to live in shelters (as opposed to private/individual
accommodation).

<P>
The law would hit foreigners who delayed deportation by destroying their
passports or otherwise concealed their country of origin; and it would also
be hard on others who refused to leave or delayed departures without a valid
reason, after their applications had been turned down. The Greens said that
this was against peoples' civil rights: the law-change would practically
starve refugees unable to return to their home-countries due to current
security-concerns there. The Protestant Church also chipped in, claiming
that Germany ran the risk of breaking the rule that the needy had a right
to be looked after properly.

Parliament (Bundestag) wants more money for R&D
</H1>
In view of the high unemployment-numbers, all parliamentary groups asked for
more money to be spent on research and development. The opposition accused
government of having missed the boat: according to Mr Thierse, SPD, the
current budget was almost 800 million marks short of what government had
promised. The policies for the future, according to Technology Minister
Ruettgers, would consist of announcements by the minister only. Mr Ruettgers
defended the job he did, and asked business to do their bit for more
employment.

Subsidies for commuter-trains allegedly to be cut
</H1>
The federal states will get less money to subsidise
commuter-trains, according to the union, and they are more specific:
accountants allegedly recommended government shave a three-digit figure of
million marks from federal subsidies. The union thought that this could
mean more cuts to services. Government did not want to comment on the matter
and said that they were still negotiating.

Plans to set up an international tele-university
</H1>
Karlsruhe, Heidelberg, Mannheim and Freiburg Universities are
planning to set up a tele-university - to boost foreign student-numbers in
Germany. There will be a two-stage approach: first, students will stay put
and study using telecommunications and multi-media, in their home-countries.
Then they will study at one of the universities concerned. Approximately
60 million marks were needed to get the project off the ground.

'Smart'-car's suspension to be lowered as well
</H1>
The 'Smart' will do like big brother, the Mercedes' A-range of
cars: it will lower its suspension. Mercedes has a 81% share in the
Swiss company MCC, who manufacture the 'Smart'. There will also be some
fine-tuning as well as intensive training for the 'Smart' assembly-line
workers in Hambach/France. Both models had rolled during so-called
elk-tests. Release of the 'Smart' will be postponed from March to October
1998

Smokers to be hit harder
</H1>
After a draft-law protecting non-smokers failed in parliament yesterday,
one of the big public health-insurers asked for a health-levy on cigarettes.
30% of cigarette-tax should be allocated to public health insurers, as
nicotine hurt the economy badly. They also recommended companies sign
agreements, on a voluntary basis, to protect non-smoking staff-members.

Receiverships still going strong
</H1>
1997 apparently was the fifth year in a row to boast record-numbers of
companies going to the wall. According to the Federal Department of
Statistics in Wiesbaden, as of November more than 30,000 applications for
receivership had been recorded. Prospects for East Germany looked especially
bleak: their's had gone up by 9.3%.

Trains moving again between Munich and Augsburg
</H1>
Trains between Munich, the capital of Bavaria, and Augsburg, the capital of
Suebia, were given the green light once again. Rail traffic had come to a
complete stop for approximately 15 hours while damaged overhead wires were
being repaired, causing some 150,000 travellers (including commuters)
to be late by several hours.
