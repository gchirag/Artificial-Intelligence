Limbach criticizes legal suit against fiscal equalization
</H1>
President of the German Constitutional Court Limbach has
criticized the legal action against the fiscal equalization revenue
distribution which the states of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Hesse
propose to lodge. Mr. Limbach said to South German Radio that this shows
that the ability to compromise in the area of politics is underdeveloped.
He continued that the German Constitutional Court was thus once again
being
used to repair matters where politicians had failed. The state governments
of Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg formally resolved on Thursday to lodge
their suit against fiscal equalization revenue distribution with the
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe as soon as July. The state of Hesse
plans
to join them. All three states are critical of the current distribution
policy for state revenue where, after equalization, the states which earn
greater revenues end up with less than the states who earn lower revenues.

BKA to consider recategorizing hooliganism
</H1>
According to Minister of the Interior Kanther, the Federal Office
for Criminal Investigation (BKA) is to examine whether hooligan gangs can
be categorized by the Police as criminal associations. Furthermore, said
Mr. Kanther in a newspaper interview, they are considering what legal
action can be taken in the fight against football hooliganism. Examples
listed by the minister include revoking drivers' licenses when so-called
hooligans use their motor car to travel to a location to cause trouble.
This, according to Mr. Kanther, would dramatically restrict areas to which
hooligans could travel. Apparently, hooligans seldom travel by train but
rather use their own cars, mini-buses or caravans.

Call for abolition of state media institutions
</H1>
The chairman of the Commission for Media Inquiry in the
Bundestag, Mr. Moosdorf, has called for the fifteen state media institutes
to be abolished. The SPD politician said to South German Radio that it was
bureaucratic nonsense that approval procedures have to go through all
fifteen of the media institutes of TV providers. Instead, he said, a
communal media institution should be established for all the German
states.
However, media policy should remain under the control of the individual
states. Furthermore, Mr. Moosdorf supports abolishing the bar on
advertising after eight p.m. on the ARD and ZDF TV stations. However, he
said that the total amount of allowed advertising time should not be
increased.
