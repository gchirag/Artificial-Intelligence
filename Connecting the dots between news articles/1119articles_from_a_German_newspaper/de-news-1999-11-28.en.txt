Withdrawal from atomic energy
</H1>
There is some dispute in the  Green Party as to how long nuclear power
stations should remain active. Juergen Trittin, Minister of the
Environment, originally suggested that the time period should be limited
thirty years. This has however been criticised by other party members.
The leader of the Green Parliamentary Group, Kerstin Mueller, said that
she cannot accept thirty years as a starting point in negotiations with
atomic concerns. The leaders of state subgroups will be meeting in Berlin
on Monday to try and find a unified approach to the problem. The Greens
in the Saarland have demanded that the Party should demand nothing less
than a limit of 25 years per atomic plant.

Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, has called for unity among his party
colleagues. He said at a regional party conference for the SPD North
German state factions in Hamburg that the last few days had shown that
the SPD were able to make and act on decisions and that the had
understood that they could be unified and successful. Chancellor
Schroeder furthermore defended the strict austerity measures undertaken
by his government. He said that the SPD's policy to state debts was to
distribute from the bottom to the top, he emphasised to the approximately

rich were interested in having a poor country. According to him, the
social security system needs to be restructured. The decisive point would
be financial security in old age. Schroeder again stressed his

CDU donation scandal
</H1>
There is ever increasing pressure within CDU party ranks on Helmut Kohl,
the Honorary Chairman of the party. Former managers of the party, Heiner
Geissler and Walther Leisler Kiep have made public statements saying that
Kohl, head of the CDU for many years, was aware of exact details
regarding finances and donations to the party. Geissler, Kohl's former
general secretary, said to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that he did
not believe that there were any larger financial transactions of which
Kohl did not know about. Kiep, the former treasurer of the CDU, said he
would be able to talk for hours when providing proof that the Kohl had
known about, and been very interested in, the source of much smaller
donations than that of a million marks. He said that the only thing
stopping him providing concrete details is that he had given the State
Attorney's Department in Augsburg his word that he would preserve
confidentiality. Kohl, who has denied all allegations of irregularities,
has confirmed that Kiep had reported to him on matters regarding CDU
finances while Kiep was party treasurer, but that he, Kohl, denied that
at any time had had any knowledge of the donation of a million marks from
the arms dealer Schreiber. Volker Ruehe, acting leader of the CDU, said
at an election campaign event in Kiel that he had called for this matter
to be cleared up before Christmas. He continued that the CDU has to
investigate and clear up the matter internally and that this should be
given the highest priority.

Abortion counselling
</H1>
Despite the Pope forbidding Catholic Church participation in state
abortion counselling, Bishop Lehmann, Chairman of the German Bishops
Association, is still investigating other ways for the Catholic Church to
continue their counselling within the state system. He said in a
newspaper interview that he envisaged that a certified statement from
those seeking an abortion that they had participated in counselling could
be accepted instead of the prescribed certification. However, paragraph
218 of the law for abortion would have to be correspondingly amended.
Christine Bergmann, State Minister for the Family Affairs, has however
said that this would not be acceptable as the law is very clear in its
formulation and that no-one wants to change the law at this stage. She
said that the Bishops had excluded the Catholic Church from state
abortion counselling when they had taken the decision that the Church
would no longer issue the necessary certificates.
