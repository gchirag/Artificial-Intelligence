ECB Inaugration ceremony
</H1>
The European Monetary Union will also decisively bring ahead
the political unification of Europe, according to German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl. At the inaugration ceremony of the European Central
Bank (ECB) Mr Kohl said the introduction of the Euro in eleven EU
member states at the beginning of next year will be an important
milestone for a lasting preservation of peace, stability and
prosperity in Europe. The European Central Bank will make the Euro
a strong and safe currency. The Euro, however, is not a universal
recipe to solve the problems on Europe's job market overnight.

<P>
In his address to the 700 invited guests, ECB President Wim Duisenberg
campaigned for confidence in the new currency. First of all the trust
of the people in the Euro had to be strengthened. It was the task of
the European Central Bank to ensure stable prices. Yet it could not
alone be hold responsible for price stability and continual growth;
to achieve this sound state budget were also necessary.

<P>
The European Central Bank will start its work tomorrow. With the
introduction of the Euro it will be responsible for the monetary
policy within the European Monetary Union.

DIW: Higher wage rises needed to support economic growth
</H1>
The German Institute for Economic Research (DIW) forecasts
a decline in the economic growth in Germany. According to the institute,
gross national product (GNP) will rise by 2.6% this year, but only
by 2.1% next year. The study also forcasts a slight fall of the
unemployment rate from 11.3% this year to 11% next year. The weak
point in the economic upturn in Germany was private consumption, in
the opinion of the DIW. The financial crisis in Asia, too, could
slow down German exports next year. To boost the economic growth
the institute demands much higher pay rises. The income of private
housholds had to grow by 4%.

accident insurer of the city of Hamburg to pay for the injuries of

Constitutional Court hearing of Gysi case
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court heard today the case
brought by Gregor Gysi concerning allegations of his cooperation with
the Stasi, the former East-German secret service. With the case,
Mr Gysi opposes a report by a committee of the Bundestag (lower
house of parliament). According to the report published in May,
the former GDR lawyer, Mr Gysi, had spied out between 1978 and
1986 East-German opposition activists represented by him. At the
hearing Mr Gysi said the most important issue was that it is the
Constitutional Court that decides in this matter. He had not
worked for the Stasi. Mr Gysi stressed that the report of the
Bundestag committee violated his parliamentary priviledges and
human rights. In the center of the hearing is the question to
what extend the court is allowed to control the work of the
parliament. A decision is expected end of July.

Building sector moans: Less public contracts
</H1>
The German states and communities commission less and less building
contracts, complains the President of the Central Association of the
German Building Sector, Mr Eichbauer. Since roads were not repaired and
buildings were not reconstructed, the current year was one of the worst
for the building sector. Public investment in construction had reached
the level of 1961. In 1998, the association forecasts a slump of 1.1%
in the sector.
