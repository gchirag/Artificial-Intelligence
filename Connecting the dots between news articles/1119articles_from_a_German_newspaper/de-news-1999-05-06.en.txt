Clinton visits Schroeder
</H1>
US president Clinton and chancellor Schroeder jointly inspected
a Kosovo refugee facility at Ingelheim near Mainz. Before starting off
in his flight to Rhenania-Palatinate, Clinton commented optimistically
on the meeting of the foreign ministers of the 7 most important
industrial nations and Russia, starting in Bonn today. He said he
thought
it possible for a consensus to be reached as early as today. "There's
reason for hope", he said. Clinton would not comment, however, on the
possible duration of the war. He called on NATO countries to be
patient.
He renewed his stand against Kosovo as an independent nation. The
best result that could be obtained would be to prove that the peoples
of
Kosovo could co-exist in peace, harmony, and security.

Railway under criticism
</H1>

all
over Germany leveled severe criticism against the railway company.

Bayerischer Rundfunk received a copy of the final report by the
Eschede
fire brigade which says that it had been impossible for rescuers to
gain

partners and followed by an exchange of rings. The registration
does not carry with it any rights or duties. Registration fee is DM
60.
It can be rescinded for half the price.
