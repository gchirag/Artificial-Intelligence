Kinkel: Turkey must not be isolated
</H1>
According to German Foreign Minister Kinkel, Turkey must not be isolated
because of their strongly Islamic policies.  Speaking to journalists in New
York, Kinkel criticized the decision reached by the European Parliament to
halt EC financial aid to Ankara due to human rights violations. This is the
absolutely wrong move, he stated. In Germany, the foreign policy towards
Turkey and Iran are used increasingly as instruments of domestic policy.
Insisting that countries adhere to minimum standards with regard for human
rights is indeed the correct thing to do, but the big picture of relations
with the NATO partner on the Bosporus must be kept in mind at the same time.

Zwickel accuses Kohl of political pharisaism
</H1>
In the discussion regarding reduced sick pay, Zwickel, Chairman of IG Metall,
accused German Chancellor Kohl of political pharisaism. In an interview with
the radio station "Deutschlandfunk" today, Zwickel claimed that Kohl took the
issue up once more and drummed it through the Bundestag with his slight
majority despite the lack of an emergency. Calling for moderation among the
bargaining parties at this time is dishonest.  And, he is the one who created
the basis for the upcoming discussions within companies.  Zwickel accused the
Metall employers of breaking the law by calling for a breach of wage
contracts. The unions wanted to use every means at their disposal to combat
them.
