Mr Fischer: Russia's attacks on Chechnya a big mistake
</H1>
Foreign Minister Fischer said that Russia's attacks on Chechnya were a big
mistake. During a joint press-conference with the EU's co-ordinator for
foreign and security policies, Mr Solana, Mr Fischer also said that Russia
would destabilise the whole Caucasian region. The Western countries would
have to crank up political pressure on Moscow, though he was against economic
sanctions. Previously Germany and Great Britain had agreed on a paper
requiring negotiations about the conflict. The paper also stipulates that
Russia has to comply with international law and OSZE-rules. Russia's Foreign
Minister Ivanov had spoken to Mr Solana and launched a OSZE-observer mission
in Chechnya.

30'000 demonstrate against coalition with Mr Haider's party
</H1>
Tonight tens of thousands of Austrians demonstrated against right-wing
populist Haider. According to police sources, some 30,000 people had gathered
in Vienna's city center pushing their slogan "no coalition with racism".
In the afternoon, Mr Haider had said he was sorry about his contentious
declarations about national socialism. During a meeting of the Free Party of
Austria (Freiheitliche Partei Oesterreichs, FPOE) Mr Haider stated that what
he had said had been insensitive and easily misunderstood. The FPOE had come
in second at last October's federal elections

Parliament passes cost-cutting measures
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder thinks that parliament's passing a part of his
cost-cutting measures strengthened the coalition. Now government has saved
26 billion marks, and there is no need for the consent of the Upper House
(Bundesrat), and this also covers the contentious plan to reform pensions.
The Upper House (Bundesrat) will only need to look at another 4 billion
marks to be cut. Parliament also passed laws modifying existing laws on how
families are treated taxwise: allowances and tax-exemptions will rise.

Mr Trittin defends ecological tax
</H1>
Federal Environment Minister Trittin defended the ecological tax against
criticism in the North-Rhine/Westphalia SPD. He said that tax-exemptions for
very efficient gas-fired powerplants wouldn't kill any jobs that weren't
about to be lost anyway. North-Rhine/Westphalia's Premier Clement had
announced that he would vote against the law (in the Upper House
(Bundesrat)), as it would be bad for coalmining. State head of the SPD party
Muentefering, however, said in an interview with the KOELNER STADTANZEIGER,
that mining of lignite (brown coal) would not suffer.

Budget-cuts in the defence vote prompted Dasa - owned by DaimlerChrysler -
to make some 850 workers redundant, mainly at the Munich, Ulm and
Friedrichshafen plants. The redundancies had to happen, and now, according
to management, though they had nothing to do with the future co-operation
with French company Aerospatiale.

Parliament passes law amending law on non-genuine contracting
</H1>
Parliament passed a law amending the rules about non-genuine contracting -
when people who work like employees get paid as contractors. How to
determine who is an employee and who isn't, will change, and the burden of
proof will be shifted to Social Security, to a large extent. Excessive
retroactive demands for contributions will be ruled out, and there will be
more chances for self-employed people to be exempt from contributions. The
contentious law had been in force since January. The amendments had been
proposed by a commission of experts
