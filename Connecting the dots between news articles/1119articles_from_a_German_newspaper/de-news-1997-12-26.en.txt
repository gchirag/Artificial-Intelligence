Mr Rexrodt: Tax-reform must lower net burden
</H1>
Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt spoke out against a tax reform that did
not mean less tax (but only robbed Peter to pay Paul), according to an
interview he granted a German newspaper. Citizens needed to pay less tax and
tax-like contributions (the latter, for example, towards compulsory public
insurance schemes).
The German Employees' Union (DAG) previously had asked coalition- and
opposition-parties to plug any tax loopholes for people on high incomes, and
consistently fight tax-evasion and -fraud. This would lower additional
labour-costs considerably.
Deputy head of the DAG Konitza (sp?) jogged memories when he stated that
workers getting a rise of 1 mark would only have some 50% of that in hand, as
the rest would go in taxes and dues. And their purchasing power had dropped
some 4.5% over the last 4 years. Therefore sales tax should definitely not
go up.

'Six Wise Men' predict less unemployment
</H1>
This was the first time for years that the six leading economic forecasting
institutes predicted less unemployment, according to a poll instigated by
the Hamburg newspaper HAMBURGER ABENDBLATT. The upturn will happen in the
second half of 1998, at the latest. A long-term improvement, however, would
require additional labour-costs to rise at a slower rate than productivity.
The so-called Six Wise Men also thought, that the two sets of labour markets
were here to stay: unemployment in East Germany will rather rise (due
to the recession in the construction industry), whereas in West
Germany it will drop. As of last November, 4.5 million persons were
drawing the dole.

Greens' head of parliamentary group asks for mediation
</H1>
The Greens Party's federal spokesperson, Ms Mueller, asked head of the SPD
Lafontaine to mediate in the conflict between the Greens and the SPD in the
state of North-Rhine/Westphalia. Ms Mueller criticised in the Berlin
newspaper BERLINER ZEITUNG, that the SPD still had not taken a defined stand
as far as energy policies were concerned. Mr Lafontaine simply had to enter
the ring as far as the debate about open-cast mining at Garzweiler II was
concerned. State Construction Minister Vesper (sp?), of the Greens Party,
emphasised that the SPD should not beat around the bush any more, but state
their intentions as far as relations with their coalition partner, the
Greens, were concerned. The SPD's behaviour showed that many of their partymembers thought that losing the current majority in the state parliament
would only be a mishap, not a signal for a change (of government). The
Greens want to decide if they will stay in coalition or not on a special
party congress next March. Employers, however, warned against a change of
government after the federal elections. Mr Hundt, head of the Employers'
Federation (BDA), said that a SPD-Greens coalition would definitely be
worse, from a business viewpoint.

Mr Vogel: no full tax-reform possible until the upcoming federal elections
</H1>
Thuringia's State Premier Vogel, of the CDU, does not think there will be a
big tax-reform until the upcoming federal elections. He mentioned in an
interview with a press agency, that a few small steps in the right direction
would be made until the beginning of next year, but no-one would go the
whole hog. Two items were likely to get changed before the elections, viz.
the minimum and the maximum income tax-rates.

Defence Ministry refutes allegations by Mr Schroeder
</H1>
The Defence Ministry refuted allegations by Lower Saxony's Premier Schroeder
claiming that Minister Ruehe had failed as far as law and order within the
Armed Forces were concerned. A spokesperson said that the allegations were
totally unfounded: Mr Schroeder only wanted to score a few points in his
election campaign, to the detriment of the soldiers. In an interview,
Mr Schroeder had been especially critical of many soldiers' lack of political
education.

Mr Kinkel asks for more efforts at peaceful coexistence in Bosnia
</H1>
Foreign Minister Kinkel asked the politicians in Bosnia-Herzegovina to make
more of an effort at living together peacefully next year. Mr Kinkel stated
in Bonn, that the big turn-around should finally happen in 1998. More than
two years after the armistice, according to the Dayton Accords, Bosnia
simply had to be able to reach self-supporting stability. Mr Kinkel also
wanted better conditions for returning refugees. The some 250,000 refugees
still living in Germany should feel a significant pull to return to their
home-country.
