Herzog reconfirms that Germany does not claim eastern territories
</H1>
During the main rally on the Day of the Expelled in Berlin, German
President Herzog reconfirmed that Germany does not claim any territories in
the east. Pomerania, Eastern Prussia and Upper Silesia are part of the
historical and cultural heritage of Germany, but not of its territory.
Herzog stressed in his prepublished speech that a reconsideration of
borders is not an issue in our time. Germans as well as the expelled people
see their future in Europe. The president of the Association of the
Expelled, Wittmann, said in contrast that the right of a home requires more
than freedom of movement and the choice to live again in the former
settlements. Questions of compensation that have been neglected so far have
to be addressed. The confiscation of German possessions in the east remains
unlawful.

Schroeder: SPD style too old fashioned
</H1>
In the opinion of State Premier Schroeder of Lower Saxony, the style of the
Social Democratic Party is too plain. He told the paper "Berliner Zeitung"
that the party has to take more risks and concentrate more on the center of
society. The addition of minorities does not amount to a majority of
society. He thinks it is a good idea to require welfare recipients to do
charitable work. It can only help to not forget virtues like work ethics
and punctuality. Ideas like this should be worked out in an SPD
programmatic paper.

Ministry of Defense rejects criticism by Court of Auditors
</H1>
The Ministry of Defense in Bonn has rejected criticism by the Court of
Auditors for the purchase of more marine helicopters of the type Sealink
MK88. What auditors' reports criticize as lacking combat-readiness, is in
keeping with international norms for helicopters stationed on frigates, a
speaker said. Naturally the supply of parts and maintenance during weeks at
sea with often adverse weather conditions can not match those ashore with
normal infrastructure. According to the paper "Bild am Sonntag", the Court
of Auditors had recommended that the German Marines switch over to a
different type of helicopters because of the unreliability of Sealinks.
