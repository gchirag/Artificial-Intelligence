Plans to quit atomic energy attract criticism
</H1>
The plans of SPD's candidate for Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, to quit
atomic energy have attracted criticism. The Federal Minister for the
Environment, Ms. Merkel, said in Bonn that Schroeder's plans were absurd
as
regards both security policy and environmental policy. The news magazine
"Der Spiegel" had reported that should they win the election the SPD would
close down the six oldest atomic power plants as soon as possible and
would
negotiate closure dates for the remaining thirteen. The SPD wants
arguments
about the transport of atomic waste to be brought to a speedy conclusion,
to
avoid compensation claims being issued by the energy companies.
Ms. Merkel criticized the idea, saying that if the plans were put into
action, state-of-the-art technology would have to be be run down and
phased
out. The chairman of Preussen-Elektrik [Prussian Electric Company], Mr.
Harich, has already threatened to submit a claim for compensation.
According
to the tabloid "Bild", he said he would have no other choice if the
nuclear power stations were closed down sooner than made economic sense.
