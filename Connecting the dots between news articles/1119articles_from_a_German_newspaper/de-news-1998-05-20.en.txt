Tax Estimators' Working Group expects big revenue drop
</H1>
The new forecast of governmental tax revenues, anticipating a drop of
billions of Marks, has generated a variety of reactions. In Bonn, Finance
Minister Theo Waigel spoke of a stabilization, and explained that federal,
state, and local governments would have 2.9 percent more in their coffers,
with a total of about 820 billion DM, than last year. He added that the
main cause of the structural weakness of government revenues was the
blockade maintained by the Opposition SPD on tax reform. Meanwhile, the
SPD candidate for Germany's top job as Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
described the situation as serious, saying that Germany needed a thorough
look at its books. SPD financial expert Matthaeus-Maier suggested that
further holes in public coffers would also appear soon.
The forecast, issued today by the Tax Estimator's Working Group, predicts
that tax revenues over the next three years will amount to 99 billion DM
less than a study done last November indicated.

EU wants to fight tax avoidance
</H1>
The European Commission wants to fight tax avoidance within the European
Union. EU Commissioner Mario Monti presented a bill in Brussels which
would have every country in the EU tax income from interest payments, at a
rate of 20 percent. Countries failing to do so would have to provide the
other states with information on the income from interest accrued by
investors resident in those other countries. Commissioner Monti said that
the fight among EU members for the lowest tax rates had to come to an end.
The bill must now be discussed by the EU finance ministers.

1.5 percent raise for Eastern German construction workers
</H1>
Workers in the construction industry in Eastern Germany are to receive the
same 1.5 percent wage hike as their Western counterparts, although not
until October 1. That suggestion, made by the contract mediator, Heiner
Geissler, was accepted by employers and the IG Bau union in Potsdam last
night. Union leader Klaus Wiesehuegel said they had agreed to a six-month
freeze in order to guarantee a settlement.

German Doctors' Council: limit coverage by public health insurance
</H1>
The German Doctors' Council (Aerztetag) has called for the services of the
public health insurance companies to be sharply curtailed. In a statement
issued in Cologne, the organization is calling for public health insurance
coverage only for necessary services in the future; everything else should
be the sole financial responsibility of the patient. SPD social policy
advisor, Rudolf Dressler, criticized the suggestion, saying that such a de
facto privatization of the health care system was clearly not intended to
save the system money, but rather to earn the doctors more. Federal Health
Minister Horst Seehofer issued a statement saying that he did not intend
to expand patients' financial participation in medical billings, but
neither did he share the impression being promoted by the public health
insurance companies that the health care system still had large monetary
reserves.

Pension contribution rates to remain stable until 2002
</H1>
Contribution rates for public old-age security can probably be maintained
at current levels for some time, in the estimation of the Association of
German Pension Insurers (Verband der Deutschen
Rentenversicherungstraeger). Making reference to a report by the Pognos
Institut of Basel, Switzerland, the Association announced today in
Saarbruecken that a contribution rate of about 20 percent would suffice
until 2002.

Nuclear energy industry silent for years about elevated radiation
</H1>
The German nuclear energy industry has long been aware of too-high
radiation levels in transports of nuclear waste to the French reprocessing
facility in La Hague and the British facility in Sellafield. As nuclear
power plant operators have now admitted in a discussion with the Federal
Ministry for the Environment in Bonn, they have had information on
radiation levels being higher than allowed since the mid-1980s; they did
not pass that knowledge on to the responsible federal authorities.
Apparently, slightly elevated levels have also been detected in a
container at the German temporary nuclear waste storage facility in
Aarhaus. The operators claim that radioactive contamination can be avoided
in the future by changing the way the CASTOR transport containers are
loaded.
Shipments of nuclear waste to France and Great Britain have been
temporarily suspended.
