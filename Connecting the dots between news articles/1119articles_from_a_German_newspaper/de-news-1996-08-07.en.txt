Police thwarted an attack on the apartment of an Algerian family
last night. According to a police statement, 15 youths armed with club-type
weapons stormed the house, in which the Algerian family lives, shouting
anti-foreigner slogans. The police, whom the neighbours alerted, prevented
more serious incident and chased the attackers off. Two Algerians were
slightly injured in the attack. Police later took 8 suspects into custody.

Federal Constitutional Court forbids deportation of sick child
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court has prevented the deportation of
a seriously ill Kurdish refugee child. In so doing, the Second Senate
rejected a contrary judgement by the Administrative Court in Dusseldorf as
untenable and arbitrary. The Dusseldorf officials wanted to deport the
seriously handicapped boy to Lebanon, even though doing so would pose a risk
to his life because sufficient medical care is not available there. The
3-year-old boy is suffering from an inherited disease and can only be
nourished by means of a stomach tube. The case was sent back to the
Administrative Court for a new ruling. The Constitution Court's decision
explains that the Foreigners Law allows foreigners to remain in Germany if
deportation would seriously endanger the health, life, or freedom of the
person in question. The boy=92s family, who do not hold citizenship in any
country, left Lebanon and entered Germany in August 1992.

Increased tensions in retail wage dispute
</H1>
The wage dispute in the retail sector has again grown more divisive,
despite the industry's first settlement in Rhineland-Palatinate. The
employers announced resistance to adopting the settlement already reached in
Mainz. The German Retailers' Association spoke of a catalogue of horrors.
After a ninth unsuccessful series of negotiation in Bavaria, the unions there
announced a new wave of strikes. A spokesman for the National Union of
Employees said that strikes were the only way to get some impetus behind the
negotiations in the coming weeks. In Lower Saxony and North-Rhine-Westfalia,
too, there were work stoppages again today because the employers there also
reject the Mainz agreement. The central issue in the strikes is how often,
given the new German store hours, employees will have to work after 6:30pm on
weekdays and after 2:00pm on Saturdays. The employers are, in principle,
prepared to orient themselves by the agreement that has already been reached
but reject a supplement of 20 percent for evening work.

Boss of metals union against resumption of "alliance for work" talks
</H1>
The chief of the Union for Metal, Engineering, and Electronics,
Zwickel, has declared his opposition to a resumption of talks, sponsored by
the Chancellor, about an "alliance for work". Zwickel said in Berlin that,
under the conditions presently in place, there was no reason to start a new
series of talks; the requirements for it would have to be changed. He said
his union was sticking to its goal of reducing unemployment on a long-term
basis. At the beginning of this month, the National Trade Union Federation
had already tied a resumption of the talks to certain conditions. It
demanded, for example, that Bonn stick to the goal they had jointly
formulated in January of halving the unemployment rate by the year 2000. The
federal government refuses, however, to make any changes to its controversial
savings programme, which was the catalyst for breaking off the talks.

Metal union's complaint against Viessmann rejected
</H1>
The Labour Court in Marburg has rejected a complaint from the
Union for Metal, Engineering, and Electronics about the 38-hour work-week
against the North-Hessian heater manufacturer Viessmann. The court says that
since the agreements are individual contracts, rather than a collective
agreement, the union is not allowed to issue a complaint. In the spring,
management had promised the 3,700 employees not to open a new plant abroad or
to lay workers off, in exchange for an additional 3 hours of unpaid work.
Over 96 percent of the staff had signed the individual contracts.

Protests against American sanctions law
</H1>
An American sanctions law against Iran and Libya has generated strong
protests. The chairman of the Bundestag's economic committee, Ost (CDU)
characterized the law as an attack on the sovereignty of other countries.
Even within NATO, he said, the United States scarcely speaks for other
countries in this way. The vice-chairman of the SPD, Verheugen, and federal
Foreign Minister Kinkel also expressed criticism.

Nazi death sentence against Bonhoeffer lifted
</H1>
The death sentences placed on the resistance fighter Bonhoeffer and
four others shortly before the end of the war have been lifted. The Regional
Court in Berlin announced the decision today. According to the court, the
death sentences had already been lifted by a Bavarian state law in May 1946
anyway, but it wanted to explicitly reiterate the invalidity of the
sentences. The background to this case is that in many German federal states
Nazi sentences can only be lifted upon application by the person in question
or his descendants or the Public Prosecutor's Office. In legal circles, it is
therefore assumed that thousands of Nazi sentences are still technically in
force.

Federal Labour Office presents study on unemployment
</H1>
The Labour Office has entered into the discussion on reducing
unemployment. Its Jobs and Careers Research Institute presented a study
today. It states that the direction presently being taken by government and
business will not lead to any noticeable reduction in unemployment; but if
the state and management and unions agreed on a common set of strategies, 2
million positions could be created. Central points, according to the study,
would be reducing overtime and more part-time work, alongside reductions in
taxes and deductions, as well as long-term moderation in wage demands.
However - the Institute says - progress cannot be achieved if the Maastricht
deficit criteria are strictly held to.

Basic daily goods to be exempted from possible increase in value-added tax
</H1>
Goods fulfilling basic needs are to remain unaffected if Germany's
value-added tax is increased. A spokesman for the finance ministry affirmed
the words of Finance Minister Waigel, who indicated last weekend that an
increase in the VAT would contain a social component. The spokesman did not
specify which particular products might be affected. The SPD spoke of a
"social alibi" for a shameless tax grab.

Fewer children killed in traffic
</H1>
The number of children killed by street traffic sank again last
year. According the Federal Statistics Office, 418 children under 15 years
of age died on German streets. That is the lowest level since the Office
began keeping those statistics in 1953. The number of children injured has
also fallen. The greatest risk to children's lives from traffic comes from
being a passenger in a vehicle. Despite a decrease in total numbers, the
number of children killed as passengers rose 6 percent over 1994.

airstrip directly to an isolated airport in Baden-Wurttemberg. Arrest
warrants for the drug dealers were issued.

Rental law to be simplified
</H1>
German rental law is supposed to become simpler and to make
rental increases easier to understand. The justice minister of
North-Rhine-Westfalia, Behrens, made the announcement as the interim result
of some federal-state committee work. The committee says that rent increases
will in future only be measured against an official standard. Owners will
then not be able to base their rental rates on expert assessments or 3
selected comparison accommodations. A prerequisite for the new rules will be
that every municipality establish an official standard, for the development
of which owners and renters are supposed to share the costs.

The trial over the estate of the murdered millionaire actor Walther
Sedlmayr has begun in the Regional Court in Munich. The inheritor,
Sedlmayr's aunt, Paula Rott, is suing the former executor, Egidius Kirchner.
She wants to annul the inheritance contract she had made with Kirchner in
1992. She is also demanding the return of 3 properties already signed over to
Kirchner. Paula Rott is arguing that Kirchner deceived her and pushed her to
sign the contracts.

Truck flipped over on autobahn

A transport truck flipped over on the autobahn off-ramp by Leonberg
today, presumably due to speeding. The 52-year-old driver was seriously
injured and had to be freed by the fire department. The truck's cargo, cans
of tomatoes spilled out over the road.
