Transrapid
</H1>
Federal Economic Minister Mueller is dropping the final decision on
proceeding with the Transrapid high-speed magnetic train squarely in the
lap of industry. Mueller said on NTV television that it was not the job of
politics to subsidize any entrepreneurial risk. He said that if industry
is saying the Transrapid will become a great success on the export market,
then it must be willing to run the associated risks. The German State will
not supply any more funds for the project.

Implementation of the euro scheduled
</H1>
The German Mark will cease to be legal tender on January 1, 2002. The
Federal Finance Ministry announced that a bill to that effect would be
introduced to the Bundestag soon. In order to reduce costs to banks and

Leading Greens threaten to end coalition
</H1>
The dispute within the federal government over the withdrawal from nuclear
energy is growing more divisive. Leaders of the Green Party have
threatened to end the coalition if no agreement can be reached on  how
long nuclear power plants may continue to operate. With a new round of
coalition talks on the subject scheduled to begin in a few days, the Green
executive spokesman, Roestel, said her party's capacity for suffering was
not infinite. Federal Environment Minister Trittin advocates a special
party congress on the issue. The Greens want all nuclear power plants in
Germany to be off-line within thirty years at the most, but Economic
Minister Mueller favours thirty-five years. Mueller has also said that
nuclear waste transports may occur again this year. He said that the
nuclear industry had already submitted corresponding applications.

Displaced Germans plan anti-exile centre
</H1>
Germans driven from their homes in former German territory after World War
II want to found an anti-exile centre in Berlin. The facility would deal
not only with the fate of displaced Germans, but with mass displacements
around the world. The president of the Federation of German Exiles, Erika
Steinbach, said the goal was to raise awareness and to prevent mass
displacements. According to Steinbach, Federal Internal Affairs Minister
Schily and several state premiers have already promised their support. She
also expressed the hope that the federal government would grant them the
use of building in the middle of Berlin. Steinbach said that part of the
necessary capital of about 200 million DM would be forthcoming from the
states. The centre is planned to open in five years.
