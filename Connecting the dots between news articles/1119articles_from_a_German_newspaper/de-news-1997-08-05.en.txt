Special sitting of parliament about tax reform
</H1>
In a special sitting the Bundestag has affirmed today the government's
draft for the tax reform. Consequently, there will be a second mediation
procedure between Bundesrat and Bundestag in September. The government's
majority also defeated the demand by the SPD to reduce wage fringe costs
and increase sales and mineral oil taxes. With a vast majority the
Bundestag abolished the tax on trade capital. Earlier, government and
opposition were engaged in a battle of words. The Social-Democrats rejected
the accusation that they were conducting blockade politics in the Bundesrat.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Alliance of Tax Payers criticized strongly today's special
sitting. It reproached government and opposition with wasting of money. Mr.
Lau, vice-president of the Alliance, said irresponsible political tactics
in the mediation committee had cost the tax payer up to DM300,000 because
the members of parliament had to be recalled from their holidays.

Solidarity tax will be reduced at any rate
</H1>
The government parties will reduce the solidarity tax in 1998 even if
further tax discussions will not result in an agreement. Top politicians of
Union and FDP confirmed that last night both sides had agreed to reduce the
tax by two percentage points. This will cost the government about DM7.5
billion but there are already suggestions how to make up for the loss.
Thus, the Liberals succeeded with their demand to cut the solidarity tax at
any rate.
Further, the pension reform is to be advanced to 1998. The
Baden-Wuerttemberg Minister of Economics Walter Doering has suggested to
finance the reduction of the solidarity tax by abolishing coal subsidies.
The coal industry had no future in Germany anyway, the FDP politician said.

Kohl assures flood victims of further aid
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl has assured flood victims of the Oder River further
support through money and personnel. In a government statement before the
Bundestag the Chancellor said the total federal aid was initially DM500
million, but the sum could still increase. The State Premier of Brandenburg
Manfred Stolpe thanked Kohl for the promised aid. In addition he praised
the tireless effort of volunteer helpers as a success for all of Germany.
German President Roman Herzog when visiting affected areas also thanked
helpers in Brandenburg for their effort in fighting the flood. Herzog said
the helpfulness of people from all over Germany showed that the rifts
between East and West were not as deep as stated so often. A total of
35,000 helpers of the military, Border Guards, Technical Aid Works, and
Police have supported the flood victims during the past three weeks.
Meanwhile, the levels of the River Oder have sunk in all places. The crisis
staff stated the dikes were under control and there were no new damages.
The Bundeswehr closed their repair works for the time being but remained
stationed for surveillance.

IG-Metall head rejects demands for 40-hour work week
</H1>
President of metal and engineering union IG Metall Klaus Zwickel rejected
demands by politicians of CDU/CSU to return to a 40-hour work week without
paying higher wages. Mr. Zwickel said this was "complete nonsense". When
those with employment had to work even longer there would be more than 5
million unemployed by the end of the year. In contrast, the Council of
German Chambers of Commerce considers the 40-hour work week a potential way
to reduce wage costs.

Expenditures for welfare decreased for the first time
</H1>
Last year, for the first time in the history of post-war Germany
expenditures for welfare have decreased. The Federal Department of
Statistics reported that welfare expenditures decreased by almost 4.5
percent to DM49.8 billion. Main reasons for the decrease were the limiting
of nursing reimbursements through welfare and the second stage of the
nursing insurance.

No radio and TV licence fees for computers
</H1>
For the time being no radio and TV licence fees will be levied from owners
of personal computers with internet access. This is the result of an
agreement among representatives of the public radio and television networks
and the state broadcasting administrators. The public networks had demanded
such a levy because radio programmes could be received through the
internet. [Currently, all owners of television sets and radios must pay a
monthly levy to finance the public networks.]
