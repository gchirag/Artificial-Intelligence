Federal Environment Minister warns Hesse's government
</H1>
The Federal Environment Ministry has warned Hesse's state government
against ordering a transport ban on radioactive fuel-elements. Any such
decree would be against the law, according to a written statement by
the federal ministry. The ministry's 10-point plan would already make sure
no such transports could take place. And apart from that, ordering
a ban on transports would be totally beyond the state of Hesse's
competence

Controversy about SPD's candidate for Minister of Economics
</H1>
The row over the SPD's candidate for Minister of Economics, Mr
Stollmann, continues. Mr Stollmann admitted that he had been a member
of the CDU until 1986, but the fact had slipped his memory.

<P>
Mr Stollmann was criticised by the unions: deputy head of the Council of
Trade Unions (DBG) Ms Engelen-Kefer, thought that Mr Stollmann's stand
against a treaty for work was not acceptable: Mr Schroeder's team has to
close ranks without any one member rocking the boat. The SPD's social
expert, Mr Dressler, also was not too keen on Mr Stollmann becoming
Minister of Economics.

supply-routes.

Grave deficiencies in German-French co-operation
</H1>
Former PM of France, Mr Giscard d'Estaing, said there
were grave deficiencies in German-French co-operation. He claimed, in an
interview with the newspaper SAARBRUECKENER ZEITUNG, that mutual trust
had gone out the door. Amongst other things this would have been due to
growing German self-esteem. Germany would not rank friendship with France
as high as they had used to in the past.

Ms Suessmuth fines DVU party
</H1>
Speaker of Parliament Suessmuth (Bundestagspraesidentin) fined
right-wing extremist party DVU 549,000 marks, as they had broken the law
about party finance. According to the law, donations of more than 20,000
marks have to be declared. The party had in fact declared a donation of
270,000 marks, but had not given the correct address of the donor. They
had reasoned that his safety would have been compromised had they published
his correct address. The DVU party said they would appeal against the fine.
