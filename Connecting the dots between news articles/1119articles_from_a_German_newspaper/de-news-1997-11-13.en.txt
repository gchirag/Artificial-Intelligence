</H1>
The German Government is concerned about the current situation in
Iraq. Defense Minister Volker Ruehe said before the parliament in

declined accusations of offering a participation of the
Bundeswehr in case of a new Golf war. The minister stressed that
during such an out-of-area mission the German Goverment would not
pass over the parliament.

Kohl urges SPD to new discussions about pension plans and taxes
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl again urged the Social Democrats to discuss a
pension plan and tax reform. Now is the time to be reasonable
said Kohl yesterday in Bonn. Both areas needed structural
reforms. SPD Chief Lafontaine had asked for suggestions of the
coalition for new discussions.  Hessen's State Premier Eichel
stressed on the ZDF TV channel that the Social Democrats were not
willing to meet until the CDU, CSU and Free Democrats had agreed
on a concerted plan.
Secretary General Muentefering stressed earlier today on
Deutschlandfunk that the Social Democrats were not concerned
about a tactical behavior.

Kohl speaks before plutonium committee
</H1>
According to his own words Chancellor Kohl had not been informed about
the plutonium contraband in August 1995. Secret Service Coordinator
Schmidbauer had only told him by phone that again nuclear material had
been found in Germany, Kohl said before the plutonium committee of the
Bundestag in Bonn. Only later did he learn about more details of the
case. Kohl emphasized that he fully trusts his colleagues. The
accusations against Schmidbauer were completely unfounded. Members of
the SPD and Green Parties had insisted on the committee in 1995 under
the suspicion that the German Foreign Intelligence Agency had staged
the contraband of the highly radioactive material.

Dispute about Gorleben is settled out of court
</H1>
The dispute about the planned nuclear waste repository in Gorleben will
be settled out of court as agreed upon by the State of Lower Saxony and
the operators. District Environment Minister Griefhahn noted in Hanover
that the approval process for the so-called pilot conditioning plant
will be completed by spring of 1999. The partial approval from the year
1990 is relevant, after which a positive overall ruling should be
expected. The plant operators waived their claims for damages in the
amount of DM 15 million.

ZDK criticizes Vatican instructions about role of church laymen
</H1>
An instruction of the Vatican regarding the role of church laymen has
been severely criticized in Germany. The Central Committee of German
Catholics (ZDK) said the instruction from Rome is a product of fear and
helplessness, and it would jeopardize the trusting collaboration
between priests and laymen. ZDK-President Meier called it a dark day
for the German catholics. The Chairman of the German Conference of
Bishops, Mr Lehmann, noted that the instruction created a climate of
distrust of laymen.
The instruction from the pope's congregation emphasizes that laymen,
and even theologically educated pastoral assistants, may only preach
during sermons in exceptional cases.

Motive for murder of Manfred Meisel on Mallorca still unknown
</H1>
One day after the murder of the German entrepreneur Manfred Meisel, his
son and the maid on the balearic island of Mallorca, the police
interrogated witnesses but have no real clues yet. Only robbery can be
ruled out. The police found a rather large amount of money at the scene
of the crime. In the meantime, local newspapers speculate that some sort
of mafia, German, Russian or even from Mallorca, tried to get even with
Meisel.
