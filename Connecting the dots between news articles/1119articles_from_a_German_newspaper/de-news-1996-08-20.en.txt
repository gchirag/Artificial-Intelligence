Kurdish asylum seeker wins in court
</H1>
A Kurd from Turkey won his lawsuit at the Constitutional
Court against the rejection of his appeal to political asylum.
The judges quashed a decision of the Administrative Court of
Arnsberg. The judges at the Administrative Court did not believe the
Kurd's statement that he had been imprisoned and tortured in
Turkey because of alleged contacts to the Kurdish Workers Party, PKK.
The Constitutional Court though takes the opinion that the
Administrative Court has not sufficiently investigated whether the
asylum seeker is persecuted in his home country. The Administrative
Court now has to rule anew.
