Admission of deficient communication regarding Ocalan's arrest
</H1>
Supporters of the arrested leader of Kurdistan's Workers' Party (PKK),
Abdullah Ocalan, continued their protests well into the night. There was
another arson attack on a Turkish business in Basel. A Turkish business
was burned down in the town of Wittstock in Brandenburg, Germany. In the
meanwhile, Mr. Homburg, Minister for the Chancellor's Office, has
admitted that there had been problems in information distribution
regarding the Kurdish protests last week. He said to the newspaper the
"Bild" that the situation should not arise where Kurdish organisations
learned about the arrest of Ocalan before the German Minister of
Security. According to the report in the "Bild", members of staff in the
Chancellor's Office had done nothing for several hours with the report on
Ocallan's arrest which they received in the middle of the night. Mr.
Hombach had only been informed by fax of the arrest at 6.25 a.m. the next
morning. An official in the Ministry of the Interior had also been
informed of the arrest around this time, but had apparently not dared
wake Otto Schily, Minister of the Interior, at 7.00 a.m..  Mr. Hombach
said that the government would naturally analyse the situation to see
where improvements could be made.
