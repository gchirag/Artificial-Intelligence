Havel praises German-Czech declaration before Bundestag
</H1>
The Czech President, Mr. Havel has called on Germans and Czechs to utilize
the historic chance for reconciliation. In a speech before the Bundestag
this afternoon, Mr. Havel said that the declaration of reconciliation is
not a magic wand which can make all the bitter experiences and traditional
misconceptions disappear overnight. However, the declaration creates a
climate in which the construction of a unified Europe will no longer be
burdened by events which cannot be undone anyway. Mr. Havel said that the
Sudeten Germans, which he explicitly called deported Germans, are welcome
in the Czech Republic as former fellow citizens. Prior to the speech by
the Czech Premier, Parliamentary President Ms. Suessmuth explained that
the return of the Czech Republic to Europe represents the fulfilment of an
obligation for Germany.

Bundestag passes cuts in welfare for foreign asylum seekers
</H1>
The Bundestag has passed a bill reducing social security payments to
foreign asylum seekers by 20%. This includes refugees of civil war and
foreigners whose applications have been rejected but who are not subject
to deportation. The new regulations will apply for a period of three
years.  The decision was taken without the support of the opposition. On
Friday, the Bundesrat [Upper House of Parliament] will vote on the bill. A
spokesman for the State Government of Lower-Saxony said that there is
likely to be a majority in favor of the compromise in the Bundesrat, which
is composed of representatives of the states.

Bundestag against sweeping condemnation of Wehrmacht
</H1>
The Bundestag has expressed its opposition to any generalized condemnation
of the Wehrmacht [Armed forces under Hitler] just because parts of the
force took part in war crimes. Following a request by the governing
Coalition, the Bundestag passed a resolution stating that such accusations
are unjustified for the majority of the soldiers. However, it was also
clearly emphasized that it is not the Bundestag's responsibility to judge
private initiatives such as the controversial Wehrmacht exhibition on
their content. The exhibition, entitled "War of annihilation - crimes of
the Wehrmacht 1941 - 1944", is currently on display at the Paulskirche in
Frankfurt.

Reactions to failure of tax summit
</H1>
Minister President Stolpe of Brandenburg has voiced his disappointment at
the failure of the tax summit talks. The reform plans of the governing
Coalition in their current form are not endorsed by any of the States,
because the burden for State budgets would be unbearable, Mr. Stolpe told
the newspaper "Berliner Zeitung". Brandenburg alone would have face
additional costs of DM 400 million. After the failure of the tax summit
talks, the Coalition and the Social Democrats are entering the regular
legislative procedure with very different expectations. SPD chairman Mr.
Lafontaine said on ZDF [public TV station] that in the end, not much would
be left of the Coalition's proposal by the autumn. The head of the CDU/CSU
parliamentary group, Mr. Schaeuble, conceded that ultimately the mediation
committee between Bundestag and Bundesrat will have to make compromises,
but he seemed convinced that the reform in its final version would largely
coincide with the expectations of the CDU/CSU and FDP. The Coalition is
considering a modification of the time frame. Chances are, Mr. Schaeuble
explained, that only the solidarity surcharge will be cut in 1998, and
that the reduction in corporate tax may be postponed. In addition, Mr.
Schaeuble pressed for pension contributions to be lowered by 1% as early
as next year. This should be possible, if the pension reform becomes law
before then, he said. After the failure of the tax consultations,
President Herzog called on the Government and the bargaining parties to
act. He said that the citizens' patience for the on-going controversies
had already been exhausted.

Miners protest against elimination of funding
</H1>
Some 4,000 miners have staged a demonstration in favor of the
redevelopment of East German coal mines. At the same time it was a rally
about the future of their jobs. The action was motivated by the
government's plans to provide less money for the rehabilitation of lignite
[also knows as brown coal] mining sites.  Currently about DM 1.5 billion
of federal funds are spent for that purpose.  For the next five years,
this amount is to be cut by DM 400 million. Speaking at the rally, the
chairman of the mining union "IG Bergbau und Energie", Mr. Berger, said
that a realistic restructuring policy could not consist in slashing
funding. The subsidies should rather be increased.

Bundesbank predicts unemployment can only be reduced in the long term
</H1>
In the opinion of the Bundesbank, the high unemployment in Germany can be
only be reduced in the long term. Accelerated economic growth could
stabilize the job market, the Federal Bank stated in its annual report for
1996 published in Frankfurt/Main. A sizeable decrease in the rate,
however, is not to be expected. The Bundesbank estimates that despite
economic upturn, the number of jobless people is likely to increase. It
was noted that reforms in both economic and social policy are required.
Lower social security contributions and tax breaks could noticeably
improve the chances of finding employment.

Long-term students will have to pay tuition fees in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
Long-term students in Baden-Wuerttemberg will in future have to pay a
tuition fee of 1000 DM per semester. Affected will be those students who
exceed the standard study time by more than four semesters. The state
parliament has passed the law with the support of the CDU and FDP. The
Republikaner party ["Republicans", right-wing party] also voted in favor
of the proposal. The SPD and the Greens were opposed. The law also
provides the universities with the ability to select 40% of their students
themselves. The new law will come into force for the 1998/99 winter
semester.

Monika Boettcher acquitted due to lack of evidence
</H1>
Due to lack of evidence, Monika Boettcher (formerly known by her married
name Weimar), has been acquitted of murdering her two daughters. At the
conclusion of the re-trial, the verdict stated that there were still
serious suspicions, because of the incriminating testimony provided by
witnesses. However, the evidence is insufficient to secure a conviction.
The public prosecutor said that he will lodge an appeal. Ms. Boettcher's
attorney meanwhile has said that he will appeal against the fact that his
client did not receive any compensation for the nine years she spent in
jail. The judge justified this on the grounds that Ms. Boettcher made
false statements after the crime, drawing the investigators' suspicion to
herself. It is the 8th time in the history of the German Federal Republic,
that someone who was given a life sentence in their first trial has been
acquitted in a re-trial. Suspicion still surrounds the former husband of
Monika Weimar. He has been living in a mental institution for many years
and is not considered fit to stand trial.
