First President of European Central Bank designated
</H1>
 Wim Duisenberg of the Netherlands will be the first president of
the new European Central Bank.  Although the regular term of the president is
eight years, Mr. Duisenberg is expected to stay in office for only four years
and then to resign, freeing the position for his contender, Mr. Criche of
France. This arrangement  allowed the French government to achieve a
compromise between its own candidate Mr. Criche and the German favorite,
Mr. Duisenberg.  The heads of state and government continue to debate the
assignments for the other positions of the European Central Bank.  This
morning, the European Parliament voted in favor of enacting the European
Monetary Union on January 1, 1999. It will encompass eleven countries.  The
Parliament thereby has followed the recommendation of the EU Finance
Ministers.

Bertelsmann halts take-over of Random House
</H1>
 The media corporation Bertelsmann has suspended the purchase of
the largest U.S. book publisher, Random House, for the time being.  According
to the New York Times, Bertelsmann has made this move to address concerns of
the U.S. Anti-Trust Commission.  The latter was poised to subject the
take-over to heightened scrutiny, including subpoenaing top managers and
confiscating company documents.  The German media corporation now wants to
eradicate the monopoly concerns first and then refile for the take-over.
