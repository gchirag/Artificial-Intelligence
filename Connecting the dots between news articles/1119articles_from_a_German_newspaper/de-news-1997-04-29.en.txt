German President's speech at Czech parliament
</H1>
In his speech to the Czech parliament, German President Roman Herzog
asked the Czech people's forgiveness for the suffering and for the injustice
caused by the German people [in World War II]. Mr Herzog said German
people were well aware of the fact that this policy of violence and crime
had prepared the ground for the later flight and expulsion [of Germans from
the Czech Republic after WW II]. However, the vicious circle of blaming each
other did not help. Reconciliation could only be achieved when both Czechs
and
Germans showed magnanimity. To this respect, the German President
acknowledged
the German-Czech reconciliation treaty to be a "manifesto for the future".
After the end of the cold war, we now had the one-time chance to build a
Europe where peace and freedom reign.

<P>
Czech President Vaclav Havel called Mr Herzog's visit a new stage in the
relations between the two states. On Thursday, Mr Havel had called on
Germans
and Czechs to take up the historic chance for reconciliation.

Policy of "critical dialogue" with Iran still suspended
</H1>
The member states of the European Union will send back their
ambassadors to Iran in the next few days, though reject the resumption of the
so-called policy of "critical dialogue". At a meeting in Luxembourg, EU's
foreign ministers also agreed on not having any relations with Iran on
miniterial level. Moreover, representatives of Iran's intelligence services
will not get visas for the European Union. Arms exports to Iran will remain
illegal.

<P>
These measures were prompted by the so-called Mykonos verdict. In the
ruling, the Berlin Regional court accused the Iranian political leadership
of being responsible for the killing of four Kurdish opposition politicians.
All EU member states but Greece had recalled their ambassadors from Iran.

German journalist arrested in China
</H1>
Chinese police have arrested a German journalist in the east of
China.
The journalist works for the weekly "Der Spiegel". In a telephone interview
he told the Deutsche Presseagentur (DPA) press agency he had been accused of
having done illegal interviews. Police arrested him together with the
brother
of the jailed dissident, Mr Wei, and have now placed him under house-arrest.
Also, his passport and his air ticket were taken away from him. The
journalist
stressed that he has been in the area for personal reasons only, and that
his stay there had nothing to do with him working for "Der Spiegel".

<P>
Meanwhile, the German ambassador to China has asked for a consultation
with authorities in Beijing. According to the embassy, Beijing officials
have been asked to allow the journalist to return to Germany.

Corruption accusations against CDU
</H1>
According to newspaper reports, French oil group Elf/Aquitaine
paid a large sum of money to the CDU party at the same time as the takeover
of
East-German Minol petrol stations in 1992. The weekly "Le Parisien" writes
that the Christian Democrats received DM13.5mio via a Liechtenstein based
firm and a mediator in Bavaria. The paper cited sources in the judicial
system. A Paris Public Prosecutor's spokesperson confirmed that an
investigating judge was ordered to look into the whereabouts of some
DM13.5mio in the entourage of Elf/Aquitaine.

<P>
CDU head quarters deny ever having received any money from Elf/Aquitaine.
The party spokesperson, Kiefer, said the CDU party has never received any
money, either directly or indirectly.

<P>
In the early nineties, Elf/Aquitaine took over the petrol stations from the
then solvated Minol collective combine. Part of the deal was that the
French group build a new oil refinery.

Greens looses case against Garzweiler II lignite surface mining
</H1>
North Rhine-Westphalia's Green Party have failed in stopping the
Garzweiler II lignite surface mining in court. The state constitutional
court rejected a corresponding law suit. In the opinion of the judges
the rights of the state parliament's faction of the Green party had not
been violated in the decision making process for Garzweiler II. The Greens
had criticised that the state's SPD government had approved the mining
project without adequately consulting parliament.

<P>
After the ruling, the Greens said the Garzweiler II conflict had to be
resolved politically now. The quarrel has already caused several clashes
in the coalition government of Social Democrats and Greens in North Rhine-
Westphalia. [When the decision for Garweiler II was made, the SPD had an
absolute majority in parliament]. Only recently, the state party
conference of the Green party rejected any compromising in the mammoth
project. For the surface mining, 7,600 people have to be resettled.
Environmentalists fear grievous damages to the region's water supply.

Council of German Cities: No transitional period for the Euro!
</H1>
The Council of German Cities favours the introduction of the
new common European currency Euro at a fixed date. A transitional period,
when notes and coins in Deutsch Mark as well as in Euro were legal tender
was rejected by its president at a meeting of the council in Tuebingen.

<P>
The council also supports a comprehensive readjustment of the citizenship
legislation, not including, however, the general acceptance of
double-citizenship. An exception from this rule should only be allowed
for foreigners' children who were born in Germany.

Zwickel: VW example should be followed by rest of industry
</H1>
President of metal industry union IG-Metall Klaus Zwickel has spoken in
favour of introducing the Volkswagen work scheme of a four-day work week in
other large companies of the metal and electrical industry. Zwickel,
however, said,  he did not advocate a 28.8 hour work week as at VW but a
work week of 32 hours. VW was the best example that a shorter work week
would not ruin a company or put the economy at risk.

Intoxication no longer attenuating circumstance
</H1>
Offenders can no longer count on alcohol intoxication as attenuating
circumstance. The Federal High Court refuted current legal practice of
automatically considering 0.2 percent alcohol in the blood as reduced
accountability. The change was based on expert witness that habitual
alcohol abusers and people born with high alcohol tolerance may still have
sufficient control at high alcohol levels. In future, judges have to check
in each case whether the offender's control over his or her actions was
reduced.

Demand for moderate collective bargaining results
</H1>
The chairs of CDU and CSU factions in state parliaments have called on
unions and employers to aim low in their agreements. At a conference in
Warnemuende the chairpersons admonished to keep wage increases below
increases in productivity. In addition, bargaining policy must become more
flexible and take into account the situation of individual companies. To
create more jobs it was necessary to realize the federal government's
reform plans as fast as possible.

SPD politicians demand to reduce top income tax rate
</H1>
Top SPD politicians have deviated from the tax policy of party leader Oskar
Lafontaine. Schleswig-Holstein State Premier Heide Simonis and Hamburg
State Premier Henning Voscherau advocated a reduction of the top income tax
rate in opposition to Lafontaine. Simonis said, Social-Democrats want to
reduce the tax burden while maintaining the efficiency of the states. On
the other hand the planned tax reform must plug existing tax holes.
Therefore she could imagine reducing the top rate to 49 percent. Mr.
Voscherau, too, said a reduction of the top income tax rate is unavoidable.
However, it was not appropriate to prematurely fix rates.

programme to create new jobs. The union-related group stated that an
investment of DM210 billion was necessary to create about 4.7 million jobs.
