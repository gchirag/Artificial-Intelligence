WEU calls for more military responsibility for Europe
</H1>
The foreign and defence ministers of the West-European Union (WEU) [a
defence alliance] have called for a tighter linkage with the European 
Union
to strengthen the WEU. The participants from 28 countries concluded 
their
two-day meeting by demanding that Europe should take over more
international responsibility in security and defence issues. In future, 
the
presidency of both organizations is to be held by the same country. 
Germany
will be the first country in 1999 to head both EU and WEU. The WEU 
assembly also decided to establish a military committee of chiefs of 
general staff to advise politicians during crises. At the meeting, 
German Defence
Minister Volker Ruehe also called for close co-operation between WEU and
NATO. So far, the WEU has carried out peace-keeping operations in the
Balkan war and in Albania. Some countries of the former Warsaw Pact are 
to
become more involved in the planning and arms co-operation within the 
WEU.

Eduard Oswald new construction minister
</H1>
CSU politician Eduard Oswald will be the new Minister of Construction 
and
Housing. This is the result of consultations between Chancellor Helmut 
Kohl
and CSU leader Theo Waigel. The 50-year-old Oswald has been
secretary-general of the CSU faction in the Bundestag. He is replacing
CDU-politician Klaus Toepfer who will become head of the UN Secretariat 
for
Environment. The construction ministry was given to a CSU politician
because the post ministry that was headed by Wolfgang Boetsch (CSU) will 
be dissolved [when the postal service is privatized]. Wolfgang Boetsch 
had not
been considered for the construction ministry and he will also no longer
run for the CSU executive.

Federal High Court decides on 12 Dec about marketing of soccer reports
</H1>
The Federal High Court will decide on 12 December whether TV rights to
cover soccer games can be sold in bulk or whether this violates
anti-trust rules. This was announced by the court after two hours of 
oral
proceedings. The Federal Anti-trust Office had prohibited the German 
Soccer
Federation (DFB) to sell the TV rights as a package for those games of 
the
UEFA-Cup and the Champions' Cup that are played in Germany. Two years 
ago a Berlin Court had allowed the central marketing of the games. The 
DFB fears that the marketing of individual games will favour those 
associations that
have the top teams. The DFB, however, wants to distribute the expected 
DM60
million profit among all associations, even those that do not have a 
team
in the championships, as it has done so far.

</H1>
Eleven and a half years after the bombing of the discotheque "La Belle" 
in
the Berlin district of Schoeneberg the trial of five suspects began 
today.
After one hour the proceedings were adjourned until next week after the
defence challenged the impartiality of the three judges. The five
persons are accused of amongst others murder in three cases and 
attempted
murder in nine cases. According to investigations by the prosecution the
attack was ordered by the Libyan secret service. The attack in April 
1986
killed two male US soldiers and one Turkish women and injured about 230
persons, some of them seriously. The accused are two German sisters and
three former employees of the Libyan embassy in the GDR. The trial is
taking place under high security.

</H1>
The Catholic Church in Germany has demanded the improvement of the 
situation of illegal immigrants in Germany. The archbishop's office in 
Berlin presented the first list of demands by a church in Germany 
regarding this issue. It stated that in the long run, illegal immigrants 
must be given the
opportunity of legal residency. Germany was in fact an immigrant 
country.
People without a residency permit must not be criminalized as illegal
immigrants. They must be seen as neighbours in spite of their law 
violation.

Differing views on future apprenticeship market
</H1>
In the coming year, industrial and services firms plan to offer 300,000 
new training places. This number of training places should be seen as a 
promise, according to the President of the Council of German Chambers of 
Commerce, Mr Stihl. It would absorb the increased demand for years with 
a high birth rate. Stihl also presented a positive picture on the 
current year. Compared with 1996, training contracts rose by 8 percent - 
more than 270,000 places. In contrast, the German Federation of Trade 
Unions expects a reduction by more than 11 percent in the coming year of 
training places, including in crafts and public administration.
