Coal job cuts accelerated
</H1>
The number of jobs in the German coal industry is to be cut faster than
previously planned. The Ruhrkohle company in Essen announced today that
24,000 jobs will be cut in the next three years. The chairman of the
company, Gerhard Neipp, said that by 2005 36,000 employees will remain, as
agreed to in the coal industry compromise deal of 1997. At that point, there
would only be 10 operating coal mines left, producing approximately 26
million metric tonnes, as Naib emphasized. He said the reasons for
accelerating the job cuts were lower prices on the world market, and falling
sales.

Arrest warrant issued for hijacker of Egyptian flight
</H1>
An arrest warrant has been issued for the man, already being held in custody
in Hamburg, who hijacked an Egyptian airplane. A spokesman for the Public
Prosecutor's Office made the announcement today. According to authorities,
the man is thought to be mentally incompetent. His identity has not yet been
reliably determined. Investigators believe that the hijacker tried to enter
Germany illegally two weeks ago. At that time, he was seized at the
Frankfurt airport after disembarking from a flight out of Istanbul; he was
sent back to Turkey.

Germany to deliver test tank to Turkey
</H1>
Germany will deliver a Leopard II tank to Turkey to try out. The Federal
Security Council in Berlin made the decision. It added, however, that this
delivery does not mean that a decision has been made about the Turkish
request to purchase 1000 such tanks. The arms deal would be worth about 15
billion DM. No decision is due until 2001. The controversial proposal, made
by Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, was apparently supported by Economic
Minister Werner Mueller, and Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping, while
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer and Development Aid Minister Heidemarie
Wieczorek-Zeul opposed it.

Greens, CDU/CSU: criticism of tank delivery decision
</H1>
The Greens and the CDU/CSU have strongly criticized the plan to deliver a
Leopard II tank to Turkey. A statement released by the Green federal caucus
charged that the move contradicted the spirit of the Coalition Agreement
between the Greens and the SPD, in which human rights were made the most
important factor in arms export decisions.
The CDU/CSU charged that the federal government was not pursuing a
consistent course vis-a-vis Turkey. CDU Bundestag member, Karl Lamers,
complained that on the one hand, the government was pushing for Turkish
membership in the European Union, while on the other hand it did not
consider the country trustworthy of the full delivery of 1000 tanks.

Bergmann: family leave should be more flexible
</H1>
Federal Families Minister Christine Bergmann plans to introduce a legal
amendment to make it possible for women and men to work part-time at the
same time, while on family leave. Bergmann told the Stuttgarter Nachrichten
newspaper that family leave must be structured so that family and career
could be better reconciled. Mothers and fathers will be able to take family
leave at the same time, according to the plan. The 19 hours of work per week
allowed by law while on family leave will also be increased to 30.
