More attacks on railway lines
</H1>
Unknown perpetrators threw grab hooks up onto the electrical
wiring causing damage to railway lines in Brandenburg and Lower Saxony,
as well as close to Hamburg and Frankfurt airport. For several hours, no
ICE, IC or city trains were able to serve the airport. The city train
line from Frankfurt to Mainz  also had to be diverted. Police assume that
the attacks were committed by anti-nuclear activists. At a bridge, they
found graffiti saying "Stop Castor - sabotage everywhere".

<P>
Nuclear waste transports are planned to start next week from the  nuclear
power stations in Grundremmingen, Bavaria, and in Neckarwestheim,
Baden-Wuerttemberg.

Gale force winds in Germany
</H1>
Gale force winds (with speeds of up to 130 km/h) as well
as  heavy rain hit many parts of Europe today, killing seven people in
Great Britain. In northern Germany, there were also strong winds this
morning reaching gale force at the coast. Several streets were flooded in
the areas surrounding Hamburg. In the highlands of northern Germany,
trees fell down causing many streets to be closed. Bergisch-Glattbach was
affected by a black-out after a tree had fallen onto a high voltage cable.

No settlement in tax reform dispute
</H1>
A day after the start of the tax reform summit, the governing
coalition (CDU/CSU and FDP) have stressed their intention of reaching an
agreement with the Social Democrats. The parliamentary leader of the SPD,
Rudolf Scharping, however, still strongly opposes government plans to
make cuts in social welfare spending. Finance Minister Theo Waigel (CSU)
said the government were now willing to talk about lowering indirect wage
costs. However, before starting any discussions about restructuring the
general budget, the social welfare system had to be structurally reformed
to enable spending cuts. In reaction to this, Mr Scharping said that he
could not find any convergence of both sides' points of view in Mr
Waigel's statement. Mr Scharping claimed that more finesse was needed in
restructuring the financing of extraneous social insurance benefits (such
as maternity benefits) in order to lower labour costs. The tax reform
talks will be continued on Friday at the Finance Ministry in a smaller
circle where the parties will decide whether or not to continue the
negotiations.

<P>
The tax-reform talks are being continued, however, the third stage of
Federal Minister of Health Horst Seehofer's planned reform of the
health-care system, which has been heavily disputed within the coalition,
is now on hold. (Mr Seehofer had suggested that future health insurance
contribution increases should be covered by the employee portion alone;
the employers' portion would  remain at a fixed rate.) In contrast, the
dispute between Mr Waigel and East-German CDU Members of Parliament
regarding the abolishment of local trade taxes on capital has been
settled. The deputies agreed to the abolishment of trade tax after the
Finance Minister promised budgetary compensations for the states.

Unions to fight planned tax reform
</H1>
Both the Union for Public Service and Transportation (OeTV)
and the Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics (IG Metall) will
oppose the planned tax reforms. The unions are opposed in particular to
proposals for taxing extra payments for shift work which would mean an
increase in the annual tax bill of DM 2,700 to DM 6,000 for some seven
million employees.

<P>
The unions plan to have three phases of opposition. Firstly, signatures
will be collected for petitions in thousands of companies which will be
sent to local Members of Parliament. Secondly, the tax reform will be put
on the agenda of every workshop meeting. Finally, there will be protest
meetings both on and off company premises. Mr Zwickel and Mr May [the
union leaders] do not plan, however, to use strikes as a method of
protest.

Russian defectors will not be deported
</H1>
Around 600 defectors from Soviet troops stationed in the former
East Germany will be granted permission to stay in Germany. The governing
coalition in Bonn reached a decision today not to deport the soldiers and
their families to Russia where they would face severe prison sentences.
This ruling applies to soldiers from the Soviet Union (later Russia) who
were stationed in Germany until 1994. About 600 defectors have applied
for asylum which has only been granted in about 60 cases.

<P>
All applicants for asylum have apparently been cross-examined by the
German Foreign Intelligence Agency and other Western secret services. For
this reason, reports the international Association for Human Rights, the
asylum seekers would be charged with espionage and high treason and would
face sentences of up to 20 years if they return to their home countries.

<P>
It is not clear how many applications for deportation have been submitted
to the German authorities by the former Soviet bloc countries and
whether or not individual defectors have already been deported.

Arrest warrants for asylum seekers in hiding are not legal
</H1>
The higher regional court has resolved that arrest warrants
issued against asylum seekers and aliens in hiding are not legal; this
is a precedent ruling. Only temporary injunctions for detention of up to
six weeks will be permitted. Previously, arrest warrants were
issued against aliens who had gone into hiding to avoid deportation.

New leads in Schleswig-Holstein police murder case
</H1>
There are several new leads in the case of the policeman murdered
in Schleswig-Holstein. The police assume that right-wing activists were
behind the murder and have established that the same weapon was used in
this crime as in the murder of a bookseller in Berlin. Ballistic experts
have compared bullet shells at both crime scenes and have reached the
conclusion that the weapon used was an American pump-gun normally used
for hunting wild boar. The owner of the weapon, a certain Kai D, is
suspected of belonging to a right-wing radical group called "White-Aryan
Resistance". The Berlin public prosecutor's office applied for an arrest
warrant.

Leader of the CDU in Rheinland-Pfalz withdraws from politics
</H1>
The leader of the CDU in Rheinland-Pfalz, Mr Gerster, is
withdrawing from German politics due to his appointment as the new
representative for the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Jerusalem. Mr
Gerster stated that he had always done his duty as best he could and that
he had taken this decision independent of external pressure. He has
worked towards improving German-Israeli relations for some time and was
awarded an honorary doctorate from the Ben Gurion University two years
ago. Mr Gerster has recommended that Mr Christoph Boehr (sp?), the
vice-chairman of the parliamentary faction, be appointed to succeed him
as leader of the CDU party and the parliamentary faction in Rheinland-
Pfalz. Mr Boehr had already signalled at the last party conference that
he would be willing to stand for office.

Harald Juhnke drunk and disorderly at Munich airport
</H1>
The German actor, Harald Juhnke, was apparently in a drunken
state at Munich airport today, before his planned flight to the Dominican
Republic. He had apparently had an argument with his son Oliver. Mr
Juhnke had received enthusiastic applause at the Friedrichstadt-Palast
theatre only yesterday evening and everything seemed to be in order until
the scene in the Senator lounge at the Munich airport where his journey
ended. Mr Juhnke was apparently rude to several other first-class
passengers and as a result, Condor decided not to allow him to board the
plane. The Airport Police did not have to be called in, as Mr Juhnke
agreed to leave the airport voluntarily - by car.

sustaining critical injuries.
Police arriving on the scene found the culprit lying next to his son on

Soldiers call for boycott of exhibition

Soldiers have called for a boycott of an exhibition on crimes
committed by members of the Wehrmacht, the German armed forces in WW II.
In newspaper advertisements, the League of German Soldiers, the Association
of German Soldiers and the German Air Force Association accused the
exhibition organizers of bringing the Wehrmacht into disrepute. The
exhibition is due to open in Munich today. The Bavarian Minister for Culture,
Mr Zegmeier (sp?), said he would not recommend teachers and school
classes to attend.
