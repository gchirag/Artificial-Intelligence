BDI: Economic trend unsatisfactory
</H1>
According to an assessment by the German Industrial Association (BDI), the
current economic upswing in Germany is no cause for euphoria. In its
report on the economy, published today in Cologne, the BDI states that the
upswing has so far been one-sided because it is carried by foreign demand
while domestic demand lacks a lasting momentum. The BDI called this split
economic trend unsatisfactory and said the upswing would not have the
power to bring about a turn toward more jobs.

Waigel criticizes VAT debate
</H1>
Finance minister Waigel expressed his opinion that the debate on the
planned tax reform should be separated from the question of a VAT hike.
Prior to a CSU board meeting in Munich, Waigel said the VAT constituted
the remaining quantity in the financing of the comprehensive tax reform,
not the initial quantity. He rejected demands from within the CDU/CSU to
use a higher VAT partly to relieve pressure on social security budgets,
saying the financing of payments unrelated to insurance had nothing to do
with the tax reform.
<P>
The CDU board is meeting in Bonn to discuss the tax reform. Wolfgang
Schaeuble, head of the CDU parliamentary group, intends to inform the
board about the state of the negotiations. Earlier, a coalition meeting at
Chancellor Kohl's office had already discussed the topic. Waigel announced
that the results would be presented to the public on Thursday. According
to Waigel's ideas, the VAT rate would be raised to 16 % during the course
of the reform. He confirmed that his concept intends to lower the maximum
tax rate from currently 53 to 39 percent.

Signing of declaration between Germany and Czech Republic imminent
</H1>
According to its German chairman Vielhaus, the work of the German-Czech
Historians' Commission has been crucial for the coming about of the
declaration of reconciliation. Speaking on Deutschlandfunk radio, Vielhaus
said that the committee had not been consulted by politicians but that the
document's wording was mostly identical with the commission's suggestions.
Vielhaus emphasized that the declaration could only state that future
political relations between both countries should no longer be disturbed
by the burdens of the past. In
the historical sense, the books could not be closed, and the debate would
also continue in public. 
<P>
The declaration of reconciliation will be signed
in Prague tomorrow by the Czech head of government, Klaus, and Chancellor
Kohl. Foreign minister Kinkel will also be present.

Grundig's chairman of the board to quit
</H1>
Accompanied by protests, the Grundig board of directors today began to
discuss the future of the corporation in Fuerth. Several hundred employees
met in front of the administration building to protest the job cuts.
Altercations ensued when several employees tried to enter the building
where the board of directors was meeting at the time. The company's
problems aggravated after the Philips corporation withdrew from it.
<P>
One of the first results of the discussions is the resignation of CEO
Peter van der Vaal (sp?). He is accused of being partly responsible for
the company's decline. The meeting lasted two-and-a-half hours longer than
expected, but when the board members faced the press, they radiated
optimism. Christian Schwarz-Schilling, chairman of the board, reproached
Philips; until the end of last year, the corporation had run Grundig via a
control contract. An outside consultant will now develop plans for setting
a new course.

Kinkel reprimands Greek Cypriots
</H1>
According to foreign minister Klaus Kinkel, the intended stationing of air
defense missiles in the Greek section of Cyprus would put the country's
entry into the European Union at risk. Outside the meeting of the EU
foreign ministers in Brussels, Kinkel said that the Union could not cope
with countries bringing additional problems into the EU from the outside.
Kinkel added that the decision on the purchase of the Russian missiles did
not help the solution of the Cyprus question. The Turkish government had
announced that it would erect its own navy and airforce bases on the
island in reaction to the Greek Cypriots' action.

Final statements in Graf trial
</H1>
In the Graf trial, the defense's final statement asked for a
suspended sentence with probation for Peter Graf. The prosecution had
demanded a sentence of six years and nine months. In his statement, Graf's
lawyer Kurt Himmelsbach doubted the psychiatric expert opinion on Peter
Graf which had confirmed that Graf could be held fully responsible despite
his previous alcohol and medication addictions. Himmelsbach assumes a
reduced responsibility.
