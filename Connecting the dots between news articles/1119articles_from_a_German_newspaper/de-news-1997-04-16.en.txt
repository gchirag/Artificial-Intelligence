Yeltsin in Germany
</H1>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin began a 3-day visit to
Germany today, arriving in Baden-Baden in the evening. He is to meet with
Chancellor Kohl there tomorrow. Tomorrow evening, Yeltsin is to be given
the German Media Award. The president is expected to bring up the
controversial Russian Captured Art Law (German: Beutekunstgesetz) during
his talks with Kohl. The Russian Federation Council postponed the final
vote on the law, which had been expected today. According to this law,
cultural goods which were seized in Germany during the Second World War
and taken to the former Soviet Union will be declared Russian property.
According to a spokesman, Yeltsin wants to return some of the art
collection during his visit.

Iran: Mykonos judgement "illegal"
</H1>
The Iranian government has accused the Higher Court in
Berlin of arriving at its ruling in the Mykonos trial in an unfair,
biased, and illegal manner. A letter which Iranian Foreign Minister
Velayati (sp?) sent to the foreign embassies in Teheran also said that the
judgement was more a political declaration than a judicial document.
The public prosecutor's office in Germany meanwhile continues to look at
instigating legal proceedings against the Iranian leadership. A spokesman
for the office announced that the spoken legal opinion of the judges in
Berlin is presently being evaluated as a basis for such action.

Kinkel: Germany pursuing permanent seat on UN Security Council
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Kinkel has confirmed, speaking with UN
Secretary-General Anan, that Germany is aspiring to a permanent seat on
the Security Council of the United Nations. At a joint press conference,
Kinkel said that the question of whether the seat would include a veto was
not of primary importance. The secretary-general, on his maiden visit to
Germany, said that the Security Council reflects the realities of 1945,
and must be changed to fit those of today. He added, however, that how and
when that will happen is not yet clear, although he thought that the
suggestion of veto-less seats would not find majority support at the UN.
The president of the General Assembly had urged that Germany and Japan
should be given permanent seats on the Security Council but without the
right to veto.

Maastricht criteria to take costs of reunification into account?
</H1>
European Union Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies has called
for the decision over participants in European monetary union to take into
account the high costs of reunification in Germany. In a newspaper
interview, Wulf-Mathies said that Germany must be allowed to enter into
the monetary union even if it fails to meet the entrance criteria this
year. She also said that the Maastricht Treaty did permit this, and that
an exception was necessary for Germany because without reunification the
numbers would have been different.
Finance Minister Waigel, on the other hand, speaking in the Bundestag's
finance committee, reaffirmed that the criteria for the introduction of
the Euro must be strictly applied. He expressed confidence that Germany
could meet the criteria in time.

Greens present own tax model
</H1>
The Green Party has presented its own model for tax reform. Central
points of the model are a serious simplification of the tax system and a
lowering of rates in income tax. The finance spokesman for the party's
parliamentary group, Scheel, said in Bonn that this model was more
consistent than the Government's. The Greens want incomes below DM 15,000
to be tax-free, higher incomes to be taxed at rates between 18.5 percent
and (for incomes over DM 120,000) 45 percent. In all, the model foresees
redistributing 100 billion Marks in taxes, especially in favour of
families with children. A net tax break is not planned, given the
country's economic situation, Scheel emphasized.

Much catching-up to do in secrecy of information
</H1>
Germany has much work to do in ensuring the secrecy of information.
Federal information expert Jacob, in his report for 1995/96, called on the
state to change its protocols to suit technological developments. In the
private sphere, information must be made more secure, he said; the present
concept of privacy of information, concentrating as it does on the state,
is no longer in tune with the times. Given computer networking, citizens
should be better protected from the mis-use of information on them by
private companies. The report also says that it is unclear when video
surveillance should be permitted; the use of chip cards also needs to be
regulated - although, in any case, personal data on such cards should be
restricted to the minimum required.

Federal Government agrees on reforms in career training
</H1>
The Federal Government has announced a career training reform
project. The goal is to get companies to create more apprentice positions
by changing the training regulations. Federal Education Minister Ruettgers
called on unions and companies to correspondingly adopt concrete
agreements in their wage contracts. The minister also wants the states to
get rid of the second day of formal classroom instruction for apprentices
each week, and to make instruction times more flexible. He insists that
career training must be modernized by having less theory and more
operational practice. Furthermore, according to Ruettgers, foreign
companies should also be encouraged to offer more apprentice positions. He
wants the number of such positions to increase by 2 percent in each of the
coming years. The reform project also provides for the introduction of an
intermediate journeyman's ticket: apprentices who fail the theoretical
part of their exam will receive a certificate for the parts they passed.
Ruettgers explained that it was absurd to put young people with a talent
for any given trade on the sidelines just because they had difficulty with
formulistic knowledge.

IG Metall union: willing to strike over old-age part-time work
</H1>
Bad Neuenahr. The IG Metall union says it will go on strike if that is
what it takes to reach a settlement over part-time work for older
employees. Union leaders emphasized this position at a closed meeting in
Bad Neuenahr. The union also reaffirmed its demand for a shorter work-week
of 32 hours, beginning in 1999, saying that that was the most promising
path in the fight against unemployment.
The leader of the employer's association Gesamtmetall, Stumpfe, again
rejected shorting work times. He described the threat of a strike as
irresponsible.
