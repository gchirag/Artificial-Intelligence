Unions calling for defeat of red-green coalition in Hesse
</H1>
Members of the CDU and CSU parties have called for a defeat of the
red-green coalition at the state assembly election in Hesse. Bavaria's
State Premier Stoiber and his colleagues from Baden-Wuerttemberg and
Thueringia, Mr Teufel and Mr Vogel, supported a change in power in
Wiesbaden. The top candidate of the CDU, Mr Koch, is supposed to replace
the social democrat Mr Eichel as chief of government. The election has
importance throughout the states because the intention is to break the
SPD's majority in the Bundesrat, said Mr Stoiber. He also turned against
dual citizenship as a normal case. Mr Koch thinks that in case of a success
for the CDU, the social democrats will renegotiate this topic.

Federal High Court rules regarding bargain offers
</H1>
When a company advertises bargains, a customer can assume that these goods
are offered in sufficient quantities. If that is not the case, the company
is acting in unfair competition, ruled the Federal High Court today.
In the current case, the MediaMarkt TV-HiFi-Elektro GmbH offered a mini PC
tower for DM 2000 in one of their flyers. When a competition's test
customer asked for it after 13 days, the computer was not available.
The case is considered a guideline for the consumer: The buyer may expect
to see the goods in the store for one week after reading the flyer over the
weekend.

Lawsuit against former Gestapo man
</H1>
The Regional Court in Stuttgart started a lawsuit against a former Gestapo
member accused of murder and accessory to murder in several ten thousand
cases. Alfons G. volunteered for the German Wehrmacht in 1942. Later he was
a member of the security police in Loblin in Poland. The sentence accuses
the 79-year-old man of participating in a mass murder. 17,000 people were
shot during the "Aktion Erntedankfest" (Campaign Harvest Festival) in the
concentration camp Meindanek in 1943. Alfons G. is accused of shooting 500
people himself, and then loading the guns again. Accessory to murder of
additional 45,000 people is under investigation. An expert opinion will
show whether the 79-year-old man can be trialed.

Schily unsatisfied with doping decisions in Lausanne
</H1>
Federal Minister of the Interior Schily criticised the decisions made at
the World-Doping-Conference in Lausanne as insufficient. The planned
suspension of 2 years for doping offences is not long enough, considering
the fact that it includes exceptions which have not been put in concrete
terms. According to Mr Schily only a harsh penalty by law would cause
prevention.
