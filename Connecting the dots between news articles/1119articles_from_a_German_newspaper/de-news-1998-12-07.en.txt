Today, representatives from government, industry, and unions started a new
attempt in Bonn at an alliance for work. Under the leadership of Chancellor
Schroeder, the first point on the agenda dealt with the fight against
youth unemployment.
According to the participants, the talks were positive. During the meeting
which lasted several hours, they agreed on working together towards a
reduction in unemployment. Among other things, they agreed on a reduction
of the business tax to 35% as early as the year 2000. The chancellor said
that the alliance for work should become a permanent institution.
The next meeting is scheduled for the end of February. The three parties
to the negotiations attempt to achieve improved possibilities for older
employees to enter retirement prior to the legal age limit. However, they
also stressed that the legal retirement age not be reduced to age 60 in
principle. Instead, we are dealing with individual arrangements for
employees on a voluntary basis.

alliance for work to be successful, the unions will have to be the leader

PDS does not back demand for amnesty for GDR officials
</H1>
The push by the right-wing political speaker Kaenzler of the PDS in the
lower house of parliament for an amnesty for sentenced GDR officials
has not been sanctioned by the party, as the Chair of the PDS Berlin and
Bundestag representative Pau clarified. She said in an interview with
Berliner Zeitung that neither the Federal Party Commission nor the
parliamentary group had discussed the subject. Kaenzler stated that
the PDS demanded amnesty as well as compensation for false imprisonment for attorney generals, soldiers of the border troops, and GDR
national officials.
The head of the central investigative unit "Government and Unificationbased Crimes", Kitlaus, called the demand a joke. The perpetrators of a
dictatorship should not be allowed any compensation for their severe
criminal behavior.
Representatives from CDU/CSU, SPD, and Greens had also rejected the push
by Kaenzler.
