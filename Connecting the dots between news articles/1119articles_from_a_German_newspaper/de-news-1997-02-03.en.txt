Continuing coalition debate on Bluem's plans concerning pensions
</H1>
Federal minister of finance Waigel rejected FDP general secretary
Westerwelle's proposal to appoint a new pension committee. Certain actions
could not be postponed, Waigel said after a meeting of the party
executive board in Fuerth. Politics could not afford hesitation or
tactics. Waigel added that employment minister Bluem's plans concerning
pensions still required further discussions.

<P>
Today, federal employment minister Bluem obtained further support in the
controversy about the planned reform. In Windhagen near Bonn, the
responsible CDU committee passed proposals on the future of the social
security system. They essentially correspond with Bluem's concept.
However, further discussions are expected at Wednesday's meeting of the
CDU executive board.

<P>
Meanwhile, SPD leader Lafontaine affirmed his party's willingness to
cooperate with the government on the pension reform. He said that with
the CDU/CSU coalition's current proposals, however, there appeared to be
no basis for talks.

SPD agrees in part with Waigel's tax plans
</H1>
In the effort to work towards a tax reform, the SPD moved closer to the
coalition's position. The SPD executive board approved a lowering of the
basic tax rate to 15% and of the maximum rate to 35%. Afterwards,
minister of finance Waigel renewed his offer to the SPD to advance the
tax reform to 1998. 
<P>
However, Waigel rejected speculations about a grand
coalition [of CDU and SPD] to carry through these reform plans.

Increasing tensions in wage negotiations for printing industry
</H1>
The wage negotiations in Germany's printing industry are moving into a
critical stage. The employers' association in Baden-Wuerttemberg
questioned the binding nature of the collective wage agreement. A wage
settlement that would not be accepted by the association's members would
have drastic effects on the collective wage agreement, a spokesman for
the printing industry association stated in Ostfildern. In the
negotiations, which are scheduled to begin tomorrow, the association's
main goal is to achieve the abolishment of the current prohibition of
working on Saturdays. The IG Medien union strives for a guarantee of full
sick pay and refuses to accept financial cuts elsewhere in order to keep
it.

Further actions against swine fever and BSE
</H1>
The federal government passed a national decree in reaction to the latest
cases of swine fever. The federal ministry of agriculture stated that
this decree would limit the transfer of pigs for breeding and mast from
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, North Rhine-Westphalia und Lower Saxony. A
spreading of swine fever to other states would have to be prevented.

<P>
Regarding the BSE case in eastern Westphalia, minister of agriculture
Borchert conceded that even with improved labelling of the origin of
cattle there could be no total certainty. A committee of experts today
acknowledged in Bonn a resolution passed in January to kill all cattle
imported directly from Great Britain, Ireland or Switzerland.

<P>
The ministry of agriculture continues to examine the origin of the cow
Cindy (sp?) which died of mad cow disease in eastern Westphalia. The
genotype analysis is expected to be concluded at the beginning of March.

and Swiss Simmentaler breeds will be mainly affected.

Kruemmel nuclear power plant in Schleswig-Holstein, a train carrying
exhaust fuel rods left the site. A spokesman for Hamburgische
Electricitaetswerke (sic!) announced that the containers would be shipped
in the direction of the Channel. Their destination was the reprocessing
plant in Sellafield, Great Britain. Previously, police had dispersed a
week-long protest demonstration by Greenpeace activists.

Military cooperation between Germany, Poland and France
</H1>
The ministers of defense of Germany, France and Poland have reached an
agreement to intensify their military cooperation. At the close of their

training as well as an exchange program for soldiers. In addition, a
coordinating group with an annually rotating presidency will be
established. France will be in charge of presidency this year.

<P>
Germany and France confirmed their support for Poland's wish to become a
member of NATO.

Albright visit: Kinkel wants to address Scientology accusations
</H1>
Federal foreign minister Kinkel wants to address U.S. accusations
concerning the treatment of the Scientology organization in Germany at
his American colleague Albright's inaugural visit to Germany. The German
government could not and would not to accept the incorrect assertions
from the U.S. concerning this issue, Kinkel told the Frankfurter
Rundschau newspaper. Any action taken against individual members of the
organization was only directed against those engaging in unlawful
activities, he said. Albright is expected to visit Germany later this
month.

Hintze criticizes insurance companies' campaign
</H1>
CDU general secretary Hintze has criticized insurance companies because
of their newspaper advertising against the tax plans. The insurance
branch hurt itself if it fought grimly against the tax reform. In fullpage ads, the Gesamtverband der deutschen Versicherungswirtschaft
(General Association of Germany's Insurance Economy) had attacked
government plans to tax interests earned from life insurance policies.
The ads claimed that long-term retirement plans would be punished and
flight of capital would be encouraged. Hintze replied that it would be
unfair to leave them tax-exempt as an increasing share resulted from
capital returns.

Spoeri returns his mandate in the state parliament
</H1>
The former minister of economics in Baden-Wuerttemberg Spoeri
returned his SPD mandate in the state parliament. His final retreat at
this point comes as a surprise. Dieter Spoeri stated professional reasons
for his move.

<P>
The 53-year-old SPD politician had retreated from all party positions
after the heavy defeat suffered by the SPD in the last elections to the
state parliament, for which he assumed responsibility. Until now, he had
still held his mandate as representative of the city of Heilbronn. It is
expected that Mario Kapizuto (sp?), the SPD candidate for the city of
Schwaebisch-Gmuend, will replace him.

<P>
Dieter Spoeri, who holds a PhD in economics, was a member of the federal
parliament from 1976 to 1988 for the SPD and made a name for himself as a
representative in the Flick committee of investigations. Since 1988 he
led the SPD faction in Stuttgart's state parliament before becoming
minister of economics and deputy minister president in the grand
coalition of CDU und SPD in 1992, with which he reached the climax of his
political career.
