European currency union expected to start with 11 members
</H1>
According to a recommendation of the EU-Commission, the European Monetary
Union can start with eleven countries at the beginning of next year.
According to the commission in Brussels, this will include Germany,
France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland,
Portugal, Spain and Finland. The European Currency Institute expressed
itself with greater reservation. Its president, Deusenberg, explained at
the presentation of his report on convergence that in most countries
corrections are still necessary. The Euro-readiness of Italy and Belgium
in particular are doubted. The Institute also requires further
consolidation steps on the part of Germany. Of the 15 European Union
states, only Greece did not meet qualifications for monetary union.
Britain, Denmark and Sweden do not want to introduce the Euro until later.
In Bonn, the government and SPD opposition welcomed both the
recommendations. Bavarian State Premier Stoiber said however, in respect
to the different evaluations in each of the reports, there are still open
questions. Now it is crucial how the concerns of the Currency Institute
will be taken into account. In May, the heads of state and government of
the EU want to make a final decision on the future membership of the
economic and monetary union.

the best way to handle it.
