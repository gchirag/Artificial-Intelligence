Criticism of Berlin building plans dismissed
</H1>
The Federal Ministry of Labor has dismissed criticism by the Tax
Payer's League of building plans for the new Ministry of Labor in Berlin.
A spokesman said that the Ministry had not made any special demands. He
also quoted the Federal Minister of Labor, Norbert Bluem, who had
apparently said that he would work in any office, regardless of how it is
equipped. Mr. Lau, the Vice President of the Tax Payer's League had
criticized that the building where the former Propaganda Ministry of the
Third Reich had been housed, was receiving a luxurious renovation
including stone and marble floors costing 127 million marks. Bonn reacted
by saying that the renovation would probably cost 40 million marks less
than originally estimated and that no final decision had as yet been made
about the building.

Criticism of SPD's proposal to hold talks
</H1>
Leading representatives of employers in trade and industry have
criticized industry's proposals to hold talks with the SPD. According to
Mr. Philipp, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, there is no
particular need at this point of time for industry to hold special
discussions with the SPD. Even Mr. Fuchs, the president of the Federal
Association of German Wholesale and Export Trade, has distanced himself
from the proposed talks. He said "I don't think much of rushed
compliance". Both the  Federation of German Industry and the Council of
German Chambers of Commerce had recently proposed to talk to the SPD
about the Social Democrats' election program.

Reemtsma's kidnapper captured
</H1>
Thomas Drach, the man assumed to be the leader of the group who
kidnapped the German industrialist Philipp Reemtsma about two years ago,
has apparently been captured. Both the "Bild" newspaper and the official
Argentinean press agency have reported that the 37-year-old Drach, for
whom the police have issued an international arrest warrant, was arrested
yesterday evening in a luxury hotel in Buenos Aires. German investigators
had traced him to Buenos Aires where he was going to attend a concert of
the Rolling Stones. The German Federal Office for Criminal Investigation
have confirmed that a German in Argentina has been arrested, but that his
identity is currently being investigated. Investigators have established
that Drach had organized the kidnapping of the Hamburg multimillionaire
in March 1996 and held him captive for 33 days. Reemtsma was released
after a ransom of 30 million marks had been paid. Drach's accomplices
were arrested in Spain only a few weeks after the kidnapping and have
already been sentenced to long jail sentences.
