Errors apparently made while calculating pension contributions
</H1>
According to "Bild," pension contributions will probably be even less than
expected, because the Coalition apparently made mistakes in the
calculations.  According to the newspaper report, pension contributions
will probably be lowered only to 18.9% instead of the 18.5% expected by
2003.  Pension contributions would therefore only drop by 0.6% over the
next four years, despite the phasing-in of the "ecological tax," supplying
the government with a new source of revenue.  Just earlier this week, the
governing coalition announced that the relief would be 1%, correcting
the previous figure of 2.3%. The newspaper reports that the Federal
Ministry of Labor falsely calculated the rising number of pension claims
that have developed as a result of the tax reform .

</H1>
Departing Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Hombach once again issued a
statement about the reasons why he is leaving the position.  Hombach

role in his decision to leave Bonn.  He complained that he didn't have a
power base in Bonn and that the personal criticism interfered with his
work.  Hombach will apparently be taking a position as Balkan coordinator
for the EU.  Austrian foreign minister Schuessel criticized the nomination
and prefers the former Austrian Vice Chancellor Bussek.

No uncertainty after the Bishops' vote
</H1>
Abortions will also remain unpunished with the new, controversial Catholic
"Beratungsschein" [proof of mandatory counseling] according to the
Bavarian Minister of Justice Sauter. Sauter stated in an interview that
Paragraph 218 of German federal law merely stipulates three conditions.
The woman is required to receive counseling, the counseling must take
place in a recognized counseling center and must be confirmed in writing.
According to Sauter, that is all that is required.  Upon request of the
Pope, Catholic counseling centers in Germany will add an additional remark
to the counseling statement in the future, saying that the paper cannot be
used for a legal abortion.

</H1>
The social philosopher from Frankfurt, Juergen Habermass, will receive
this year's Theodor Heuss award.  The jury is honoring him for his
contributions to the public discussions on democracy and society.  The
jury feels that Habermass' lifework in science and politics is aimed at
rationality in understanding and behavior.  The sociologist, who was born
in 1929, is considered the last prominent representative of the Frankfurt
School, which was founded by Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer.

32-hour week apparently no longer an issue
</H1>
According to various press reports, the heads of IG Metall [the German
union for metal, engineering and electronics] are retreating from their
long-term attempts to shorten the work week.  The union board is
apparently working on a new concept that they intend to present during
the next union congress in the beginning of October.  The regional union
leaders were the biggest critics of the suggested 32-hour work week, which
was suggested by IG Metall leader Zwickel.

German tobacco industry threatened with million Mark legal suit
</H1>
As reported in "Focus," a lawyer from Hamm is preparing to file damage
claims in Dortmund Regional Court for two health insurance companies from
the Ruhr area.  The law regarding product liability serves as a basis for
the claims.  The prosecution intends to prove that the tobacco industry
did not point out the addictive effects of nicotine and acetaldehyde even
though they knew about them.  Patients suffering from lung cancer will
testify on behalf of the plaintiffs.
