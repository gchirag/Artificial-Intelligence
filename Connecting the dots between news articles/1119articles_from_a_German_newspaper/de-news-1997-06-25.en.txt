Bundestag passes first organ transplant law
</H1>
After a passionate debate, the Bundestag today passed Germany's first
organ transplant law. Under the new law, a person will be considered dead
when all brain function has ceased, as attested to by 2 independent
doctors. The five-hour debate was unusually factual, yet still passionate,
in part due to positions which cut across party lines. Proponents of the
so-called Extended Assent Solution, including Federal Health Minister
Seehofer and SPD vice-parliamentary leader Rudolf Dressler, made reference
to current practices, pointing out that if only the deceased, and not
his/her family as well, could agree to the procedure, then there would be
hardly any organ transplants in Germany at all. Such arguments obviously
won the day, as the expanded assessment solution was passed by a healthy
majority: 424 in favour, 201 against.

First old-age part-time model at Volkswagen
</H1>
Volkswagen is the first German company to be introducing a plan
for old-age part-time. VW and the IG Metall union have come to an agreement
in this regard. It will apply to the 90,000 VW employees in western
Germany. The plan has workers between the ages of 55 and 60 working
half-time, but arranged in such a way that they will work full-time for 2.5
years, and then not at all. For all 5 years, they will receive 85 percent
of full pay. Furthermore, pension rates will not be cut; Volkswagen will
continue to pay into the pension scheme at the full rate for workers
between 55 and 60. The concessions on the union side were a matter of long
dispute. The company wanted cuts to the supplement for working Saturdays.
In the end, the union got its way; the agreement was reached without any
changes to the Saturday supplement. However, Saturday can be integrated
into normal shift operations. Both sides also agreed that wages and
supplements in the West would be increased by 1.5 percent this year, and by
another 2.5 percent in August of next year.

Old-age part-time negotiations in Baden-Wuerttemberg collapse
</H1>
The negotiations for an old-age part-time plan in the
metalworking industry in Baden-Wuerttemberg have been broken off. A
spokesman for the employers' association Gesamtmetall said they saw no
chance of an agreement with the IG-Metall union. The primary hurdle is the
flexibility of the contract. Local union leader Zambelli (sp?) said after
today's talks that the was going to recommend to his parent contract
commission that it declare the talks failed. He added that if necessary,
the union would not shy away from a strike. Chief negotiator for the
employers, Fritsche, said that he was only willing to make an agreement if
it was not binding on all affected companies. The union is aiming for a
contract similar to that reached at Volkswagen last night.

Kohl effects repudiation
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Kohl has forced the Hamburg magazine Stern to
grant him a repudiation. The magazine wrote that Kohl has said, during a
sitting of his party's parliamentary group, that CDU supporters were
smart-asses. Kohl said that that was wrong, that he had rather said spoken
of smart-asses in the media. According to the Chancellor's Office, this is
the first such official repudiation by Kohl during his term in office.

No more work permits for asylum-seekers
</H1>
The Federal Labour Office does not want to grant work permits to
refugees and asylum-seekers who entered Germany after May 15 of this year.
The Hanover Allgemeine newspaper reports that a memo to that effect was
sent to all the labour offices in the country. The reasons being given are
the critical situation in the domestic labour market, and the uncontrolled
flood of Albanians into Germany.

More construction jobs expected to be lost
</H1>
The central association of German construction companies expects up
to 80,000 jobs in the industry to be cut over this and next year. The
association's President Eichbauer said that this meant that the loss of
jobs would continue unabated. He reaffirmed his prognosis that investment
in construction would fall by 2.5 percent this year. Eichbauer accused
public tenderers of having a poor pay ethic - the leading cause of
bankruptcy among middle-sized construction companies.

Cancer researcher suspended
</H1>
Cancer researcher Friedhelm Hermann (sp?) has been suspended
indefinitely from his work. Baden-Wurttemberg's Sciences Minister von
Trotha made the announcement today. The doctor is thought to have falsified
research results. Until he has been cleared of all wrong-doing, Hermann
must cease his work. Von Trotha has suspended his access to the University
Clinic in Ulm until further notice because of the threat he represents to
the reputation of the University of Ulm and to university research in
general. Meanwhile, continuing investigations have indicated that it is no
longer a matter of 4 documents that need to be critically re-examined, but
of 28. The temporary suspension means that Hermann cannot teach or conduct
research for the time being. He will nevertheless continue to receive his
pay of about DM 10,000. Hermann denies the accusations but admits that in
some cases he may have committed an error in judgement. If the accusations
should be determined to be true - the public prosecutor's office in Ulm has
instigated proceedings on charges of fraud - von Trotha will have to
convene a disciplinary hearing, which could see Hermann dismissed for good.

More Nazi graffiti on church in Luebeck
</H1>
Unknown vandals defaced another church in Luebeck with right-wing
extremist symbols and slogans last night. The name of a Luebeck pastor,
whose congregation is granting a group of Algerian refugees church asylum,
was also written on the church wall. According to police, swastikas were
also sprayed on the house of writer Guenter Grass. Only a month ago a
Catholic church in the city was sprayed with Nazi symbols and then set fire
to. The public prosecutor's office believes that the 2 new attacks were
done in imitation of the prior one.
