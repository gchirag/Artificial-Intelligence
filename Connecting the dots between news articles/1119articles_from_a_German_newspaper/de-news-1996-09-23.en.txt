German-Czech Historians Commission in agreement
</H1>
In contrast to German and Czech politicians, the German-Czech Historians
Commission is mostly in agreement regarding its evaluation of the two
countries' common history. The statement was made by Professor Kren, the
Czech head of the commission, in Prague today. He said this was especially
true for the controversial subject of the expulsion of the Sudeten Germans.
Czech
scholars estimate the number of expulsed Germans at 24,000 to 30,000, a
higher
number than the 19,000 estimated by their German colleagues. According to
Kren, however, further expert examination of the results remains necessary.
The
controversy about the expulsion of Sudeten Germans has so far prevented a
joint
German-Czech declaration.

Natalie Astner murder case triggers heated debates
</H1>
The murder of seven-year old Natalie Astner has now triggered discussions in
Germany whether sexual offenders should be released early on parole. The
Bavarian Cabinet will debate the topic tomorrow. Minister president Stoiber
has
ordered a detailed report from the Bavarian Interior Minister. Today's
autopsy
of the girl's body supported the suspicion of sexual abuse. The official
results will not be presented until tomorrow. Information was leaked today
that
prior to her violent death, Natalie Astner was sexually abused but not raped.

<P>
According to the coroner, the abductor choked the child and threw the
unconscious girl in the river Lech where she drowned near a lock about one
kilometer from her parents' home. Heated arguments were caused by news of the
27-year old perpetrator's previous conviction. In the early 90's, the auto
electrician had been sentenced to four years and six months in prison for
assaulting three young women and raping three girls aged nine and eleven. He
was freed on parole after three years following a favorable prognosis on
future
social behavior. He was in voluntary therapy; both his psychiatrist and his
parole officer had certified a strengthening of his personality only four
weeks
ago.

it."
