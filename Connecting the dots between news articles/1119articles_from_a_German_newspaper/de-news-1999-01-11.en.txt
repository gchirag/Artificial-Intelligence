Schroeder demands more equitable allocation of EU contributions
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder appealed to the member nations of the EU
asking them to show willingness for compromise during negotiations
around the Agenda 2000 reform parcel. The EU Council president
spoke after a joint session between the federal cabinet and the
EU commission in Bonn today. Gerhard Schroeder led off demanding
that not only Germany's contribution quota but also those of other
countries be allocated under a more equitable scheme. After
today's meeting with Santer the German chancellor is convinced
he will get a green light from the commission chairman. It is
Schroeder's aim to have all Agenda 2000 matters still under
dispute on the German side clarified by the time the EU summit
meets in March. By that time also, viable alternatives for the
net contributions of member nations as well as a downward
adjustment of subsidies forthe planned EU wide agrarian reform
will have to be worked out. Otherwise, says Schroeder, the timing
for the planned eastward expansion of the EU will be in jeopardy.
