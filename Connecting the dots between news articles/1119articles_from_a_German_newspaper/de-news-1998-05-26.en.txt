Hoeppner re-elected in Saxony-Anhalt
</H1>
Saxony-Anhalt has a new government. One month after the state
elections, SPD politician Hoeppner was re-elected as State Premier
with the help of votes from the PDS. He reached the required absolute
majority in the first round. The new SPD minority cabinet, consisting
of six men and three women, was sworn into office in the afternoon.
Hoeppner offered to cooperate with all democratic parties and appealed
for cooperation to politicians who had not voted for him. 
<P>
Hoeppner's
re-election with the support of the PDS met with strong criticism in
Bonn's governing coalition. CDU chairman Chancellor Kohl accused the
social democrats of no longer having any scruples in their drive for
power.
<P>
"Now, the talks by the SPD concerning the new center turn out to be
an act of deception," according to chancellor Kohl. This decisive
point in German history indicates the departure to a leftist republic.
According to Kohl, the SPD betrays the principle of "No cooperation
with radicals from the left and the right." SPD candidate for chancellor Schroeder had tolerated Hoeppner and would be using the help of
the PDS in Bonn, too. Kohl's new governmental spokesperson, Hauser,
stated that this coalition is almost the same as if the Nazis had cogoverned under a new name after the war.  The CSU spoke in similar
terms of the dirtiest election since 1933. Schroeder would also count
on the votes by the PDS with the same lack of character.

for the troubles involving the Castor transports. The boards of directors of the companies involved had not been informed about the irregularities, said the president of the German Nuclear Forum, Steuer,
in Munich. 
<P>

party would file a petition for dismissal if minister Merkel would not
give any satisfying answers in parliament tomorrow.

several prosecuting attorney's offices. The charges are directed at

More and more students have to work for their upkeep
</H1>
According to the Office of Student Affairs=92 social report, more
and more students have to work for their upkeep during both their
semesters and their vacations. 
<P>
Students work on paid jobs for an
average of 13 hours a week. Some 14% fill regular half-day jobs
working over 20 hours a week. According to Prof. Hans-Dieter Rinken
(sp?), president of the Office, this is to a major part due to the
way state subsidies have developed. These are increasingly phased out
of educational financing. In Western states, only 24% of students
receive subsidies during their regular study time; in Eastern states
the number has been reduced to 35%. In the old (Western) states, state
subvention has shrunk to a calculated 10% of students=92 gross income.
