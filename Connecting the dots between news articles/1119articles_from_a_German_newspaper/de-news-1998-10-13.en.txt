Kinkel welcomes Kosovo accord
</H1>
German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has welcomed the agreement to
resolve the Kosovo crisis as being good news. Mr Kinkel added, the
pressure on Belgrade by the international community has to be maintained
nonetheless until implementation of the accord have been verified.
Next Friday, the Bundestag (Germany's lower house of parliament) will
vote on the question whether German forces would take part in a NATO
action [in Kosovo]. This question is rather disputed within Buendnis90/
The Greens, the expected junior partner in chancellor-designate Gerhard
Schroeder's new government, though the issue has been "dedramatized"
within the party, according to parliamentary party spokesperson Joschka
Fischer. After the Yugoslav Presidents's giving in [to international
pressure] the situation had changed. Mr Fischer said the Greens had
to make nonetheless a difficult decision. It was, however, impossible
that Germany fell out of solidarity within NATO. Several left-wing
politicians of The Greens stressed that a military action by NATO
within clear UN mandate would violate international law and hence
unacceptable.

the German industry towards the tax plans of the future Federal

having tax plans which are worse than everything that the German

New accusations and investigations against Schaufler
</H1>
In connection with the charity incident of the state-owned
"Suedwestdeutsche Verkehrs-AG" (South-West Traffic Ltd, SWEG) new
accusations have been brought up against its chairman, the minister
of transport, Mr Schaufler. Therefore, in his position as president
of the tourism association of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Schaufler has
apparently taken a five-digit amount out of the account in anticipation
of an upcoming fund-raising drive. Because the money were not returned
afterwards, the SWEG asked for a corresponding donation, to basically
fill the hole again. In connection with two further donations to the
SSV Reutlingen sports club and a private audience given by pope John
Paul II, the public prosecutor's office in Offenburg is now also
investigating against Mr Schaufler. Mr Schaufler said that he is
calmly awaiting the preliminary proceedings.
