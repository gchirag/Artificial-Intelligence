Volkswagen to start own temp agency
</H1>
Volkswagen apparently wants to found its own temporary employment
agency. According to a newspaper report, this agency will temporarily
place VW workers in plants requiring more manpower during peak production
periods.
The difference between these workers and more permanent employees: the
temporary workers will not receive the wages which VW normally pays, but
rather the lower wage which is usual in the industry as a whole. The union
criticizes the idea, fearing that the car-maker is trying to undermine the
negotiated wage package. The primary argument: VW would be paying
different wages for the same work. A spokesman for the company has
meanwhile confirmed the report in the Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung
newspaper, saying that Volkswagen was indeed planning a kind of internal
employment office, for the sake of a more flexible use of manpower.

No new leads in Krefeld arson case
</H1>
The motives and the culprits in the incendiary attack in Krefeld
remain a mystery. A spokesman for the Krefeld police reported this morning
that there are no new clues or information as to the identity of the
arsonist(s) or possible motives.
A 41-year old Turkish woman and 2 of her children were killed in the fire
on Easter Monday.
Authorities are assuming that a hatred of foreigners was not the motive
behind the attack on the multi-storey building. The public prosecutor's
office has offered a reward of DM 50,000 for information leading to a
breakthrough in the case.

Federal Statistics Office releases financial figures
</H1>
In January, the German balance of payments saw the deficit, at
DM 9 billion, more than double over last year. The Federal Statistics
Office released the figures today. In January of 1996, that amount was DM
4.1 billion. In the first month of this year, exports were up by 5
percent, to DM 64 billion, and imports were up by 3.7 percent, to 59
billion.
The municipalities managed to halve their deficits last year. The
Statistics Office states that the figure for 1996 was about DM 6.6 billion
lower than in 1995. Reduced social expenditures, due to changes in nursing
care insurance and in child allowance, were named as reasons for this
development.

Euro could become a danger for the Germany economy
</H1>
The overseas boss of the American auto manufacturer General
Motors, Hughes (sp?), sees some danger for the German economy in the
introduction of the common European currency, the Euro. He said that,
while economic decisions would become easier - because the data would be
more transparent with a single, unified currency - different wage costs,
social deductions, and taxes would become immediately visible as well, and
Germany could come out rather badly in such a comparison with other
European countries. Hughes made the statement in a talk with the Hamburg
newspaper "die Woche". He also said that some companies could get into
trouble because they would no longer be able to sell their products at
different prices in different countries within the EU; the inevitable
price reductions would unleash another wave of down-sizing, which would in
turn burden social coffers further.

Federal government rejects Erbakan's criticism
</H1>
The federal government has rejected criticism from Turkish Prime
Minister Erbakan in connection with the incendiary attack in Krefeld.
Erbakan had said, among other things, that the governments of European
countries also carried responsibility for atrocities committed against
Turks. Government spokesman Schmuelling (sp?) called on the Prime Minister
to refrain from making premature accusations of guilt. He added that
Germany was governed by the rule of law, under which criminals were
prosecuted without regards to their identity, racial or otherwise.
Schmuelling also referred to the determination of the public prosecutor's
office that there was no evidence of anti-foreigner motivation in the
attack. The investigation continues.

Amnesty International complains of human rights violations in Russia
</H1>
Two weeks before Russian President Yeltsin's planned visit to
Germany, Amnesty International has complained of systematic abuse and
torture in Russia.
According to the human rights organization: Russian prisons are a hell on
earth. Prisoners are systematically tortured, degraded, and tormented. At
Russian police stations, people are beaten and deprived of oxygen until
they almost suffocate. Not only police engage in torture, but doctors are
also involved. In some cases, doctors have monitored pulse rates during
torture sessions, telling the torturers whether the victims could take any
more abuse.
Amnesty International says that prison conditions in Russia are degrading
and inhumane, and it is calling on the German government to speak to
Russia about respecting human rights.

SPD and unions call for rethinking of politics and economics
</H1>
Faced with mass unemployment and public debt, the SPD and the trade
unions are calling for a rethinking of politics and economics in Germany.
They say there must be more social responsibility and willingness to
innovate again. The leaders of the SPD and of various unions issued that
statement today.
Calls by the National Union of Employees for a new concept for tax reform
from the SPD were rejected by the Social Democrats. A spokesman for the
party, Wiebusch, contradicted the suggestion by the leader of the union,
Issen, that SPD leader Lafontaine had agreed to such a concept. Wiebusch
said a new tax concept was out of the question; her party had already
presented its position on tax policy last fall, and had filled in the
details sufficiently since then. She did add, however, that the SPD was
still discussing various models for tax reductions for workers and
families; for example, adjusting the tax-free minimum income, the tax rate
in the lowest tax bracket, or child allowance.
