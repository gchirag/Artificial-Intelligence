Bundestag decides on blanket annulment of Nazi sentences
</H1>
More than 50 years after the end of WWII, the Bonn parliament
decreed the blanket annulment of all illegitimate Nazi court
sentences. The Union parties, FDP and SPD issued a law
rehabilitating several hundreds of thousands of victims of the
Nazi regime. By this law, all sentences based on political,
military, racial, religious or personal conviction grounds
are declared null and void. Forced sterilization is also
declared unlawful. No indemnities are to be paid. During
the discussion, several members voiced their discontent
with the fact that this law is coming much too late for
many of those concerned. Green Party and PDS abstained. The
Greens criticized that the law did not clarify the situation
of deserters and homosexuals, as these groups were not named
expressly.

Former Compuserve boss gets a 2 year suspended sentence
</H1>
A countrywide uproar was caused by a decision of the Munich
District Court in the action against Internet illegal porno.
Computer specialists accuse the judges of having decided
without any knowledge of technical facts. Fedral Minster for
R&D Ruettgers announced his intention to have a sharp look at
the decision. The Munich judges handed down a suspended 2-year
sentence to former Compuserve/Germany manager Felix Somm for
not preventing Internet distribution of child and violent
porno material. Even the prosecution was surprised, having
pleaded for absolution on the grounds that in 1995 it had
not been technically possible for Compuserve to filter the
contents of all messages. The defense was outraged and
horrified and announced their intent to appeal. It was
said that the prosecution was also planning something
along this line.

Federal govt. to return roughly DM 1 billion to power companies
</H1>
Germany's federal government will have to shell out about
DM 1 billion in arrears on coal subsidies. The Federal Administrative Court
in Berlin decided that the cutback in
subsidies for coal used by electrical power suppliers in 1986
had not been correctly executed. The judges thereby agreed
with several power companies who had asked for recalculation.
The companies' argument was that they were forced to use
expensive German coal, but the difference in cost had not
been compensated in full. They had asked for a total of
DM 3 billion in arrears.

it in other countries in the Union. The agreement, reached after
7 years of discussion, will now have to be ratified by the
15 member countries.

Gysi's emergency appeal to Federal Administrative Court flops
</H1>
PDS politician Gysi was unsuccessful, for the time being, with
his appeal to the Federal Administrative Court against the
accusation of having been a collaborator of STASI [the former
East German secret police]. The court refused to accept his
emergency appeal against the Bundestag's Immunity Committee.
The court found that an immediate decision in order to prevent
severe negative effects was uncalled for. The merits of the
appeal are to be decided by end June. The parliamentary
committee can now publish its findings which imply the official
collaboration of Gysi with STASI was a proven fact. SPD have
urged Gysi to face the political music.
