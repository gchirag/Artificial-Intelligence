FDP wants to start offensive to eliminate local trade tax on capital
</H1>
The Liberal Democratic Party wants to start the new year with an offensive
for the elimination of local trade tax on capital. The SPD governed states
will not escape their responsibility on this subject, FDP Secretary General
Westerwelle said in Bonn. The local trade tax on capital hurts the middle
class and is partly responsible for the fact that jobs are relocated
abroad. According to Westerwelle, the two SPD State Premiers from
Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg, Hoeppner and Stolpe, additionally violate
their oath of office if they allow the introduction of this tax in their
states.

Lawsuit against Egon Krenz continues
</H1>
In Berlin, the suit against the last GDR Head of State and Party Egon Krenz
continued. The defense had announced that they will show through witnesses
from the time that, in spite of decades of propaganda saying the opposite,
the GDR was not a sovereign state but acted mostly according to orders from
Moscow. It will not be possible to avoid making the trial somewhat of a
historical seminar, Krenz' lawyer announced. The defense wants to back up
statements by Krenz and the three other defendants that East Germany was
not able to perform any alteration of the wall or the inner German border
without approval by the Soviet Union. Krenz had repeated that the way the
GDR treated its borders was imposed by the Soviet Union. The politburo
never violated any GDR laws. Without approval by former Soviet President
Gorbatchov, all measures to open the borders in the fall of 1989 would have
to have been reversed. Krenz accused the prosecution of constructing
accusations. That shows that the real structure of state and society in the
GDR is being ignored.
