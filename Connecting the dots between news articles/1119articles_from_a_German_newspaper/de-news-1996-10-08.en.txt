Situation on job market slightly better
</H1>
The situation on Germany's job market improved only slightly in
September. According to the data published by the Federal Labor
Office today, the number of unemployed persons decreased by 53,000
to 3.9mio. The unemployment rate went down to 10.1%, compared to
10.2% in August. Compared to one year ago, this is however an increase
by 1% or 300,000 unemployed persons, up from 9.1%.
In West Germany the unemployment rate is now at 8.9%, and in the East
at 14.7%. President of the Federal Labor Office Bernhard Jagoda said
the usual consolidation of the job market in autumn was hard to recognize
this year because of the weak economic growth. In the East the situation
is better than in the West thanks to job creation schemes.

<P>
In Berlin, the unemployment rate decreased to 13.8% in September down
from 14% a month ago. Compared to one year ago there were, however,
23,000 more job seekers. Only the eastern districts profited from
the decrease this month - in the western districts the number
of unemployed persons rose slightly. In the State of Brandenburg, the
unemployment rate decreased from 14.6% a month ago to 14.4% in
September.

Comments on sick pay dispute
</H1>
Deputy chairman of the National Trade Union Federation Ursula Engelen-
Kefer called the result of talks about sick pay in the steel and
engineering industry a strong defeat for the employers' side. It came
out clear that their position was not acceptable, said Ms Engelen-Kefer in
ZDF-MORGENMAGAZIN T.V. TV program. After yesterday's talks, the employers
association for the steel and engineering industry advised their members
not to cut sick pay for the time being. Though they want to hold on to
sick pay cuts nonetheless yesterday's agreement with IG Metall union.
Secretary general of the employers association, Mr. Waina (sp?) said in
a ZDF TV program this morning it would be useless to fool the employees
by pretending that all social standards could be kept forever.
Both sides also agreed that talks about the disputed matter shall start
as early as coming Thursday.

New proposal: Work longer and get less pension
</H1>
A retirement age of 67 years and a lowering from 70% to 65%
of the average net income was proposed by CDU social politics experts
Mr. Luven and Mr. Kauder (sp?). The higher retirement age was justified
by the higher life expectancy, the financial burdens of which can not
be carried by today's contributors to the pension funds alone. In addition,
a gradual decrease of the pensions level to 65% for a pensioner who
worked for 45 years would be acceptable. The concept of old-age pension
consisting of state pension, companies pension and private provision
is not questioned by their proposal, they say.

Germany found liable by European Court
</H1>
The European Court ruled to day that the Federal Republic
of Germany has to pay compensation to customers of several package tour
operators after these companies went bankrupt. The judges declared the
German State liable since it did not implement in time a directive of the
European Union concerning package tours. According to the directive, tour
operators were obliged since 1993 to prove, that they have sufficient
financial reserves. A corresponding law was enacted as late as mid 1994
in Germany.
[Directives of the European Union do not automatically become part of
the law in each member state. They rather have to be implemented by
each state. When, however, a member state does not implement a particular
directive, it is liable for damages caused by the non-implementation.]

SPD expels member of parliament
</H1>
The Social-Democratic Party (SPD) expelled Klaus Neumann,
member of parliament. A final decision to this effect was taken today
by the respective party committee, said the regional secretary-general,
Mr. Hartung. The 51-year old lawyer has been reproached for party
impairing behavior. The Berlin member of the Bundestag (lower house of
parliament) had concealed several previous convictions, for example
for tax fraud. Later, additional criminal procedures were taken out
against him.
By expelling Mr. Neumann, the numbers of deputies in the SPD faction
of the Bundestag decreases to 251.
