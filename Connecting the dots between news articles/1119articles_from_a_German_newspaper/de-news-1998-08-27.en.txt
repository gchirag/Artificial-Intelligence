Green Party starts hot phase of election campaign
</H1>
An event in Berlin was the Green Party's commencement of the final phase of
the election campaign. Their chosen slogan is: "The countdown runs - still
one month Kohl". The major focus of the campaign, besides environmental
politics, is the fight against unemployment, mainly youth unemployment.
Juergen Trittin, one of the two chairmen, says: "We need an intensive
effort to reduce youth unemployment. Apprenticeships should be available
for every youth. Only splitting the costs for apprenticeships can make this
possible. We have to go into a tax reform which really eases the financial
burden of low and middle incomes, and which will not be levelled out by
taxation of night supplements."

DGB wants environmental politics to have stronger impact
</H1>
The German Federation of Unions (DGB) is in favour of giving environmental
protection issues more significance within politics. In this context, DGB
Chairman Heinz Putzhammer asks for an ecological tax reform. According to
Putzhammer this would include an increase in prices of all non-renewable
energy. In the future, environmental protection would also be of great
importance for the job market. As scientific calculations showed, more than
100.000 new jobs per year could be created by an expansion of energy-saving
techniques.

Aggravated arguments about children- and youth-report
</H1>
Discussions around the children- and youth-report have become
aggravated. The authors of the study accused Family Minister Claudia Nolte
of playing down its results and of denying an increase of child poverty in
Germany. Repeatedly the SPD asked for a public discussion of this study in
parliament. According to the study, about 12% (west) and 20% (east) of the
youth live in poverty because their families have less than half the
average income available. Yesterday, Family Minister Nolte denied such
estimates. In her opinion, experts defined 'poverty' wrongly.
