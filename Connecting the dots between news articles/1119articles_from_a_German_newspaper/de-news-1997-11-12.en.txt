New call for talks on tax and pension reforms from Kohl
</H1>
According to Finance Minister Waigel, Chancellor Kohl has issued a new
call to the SPD to participate in talks on the tax and pension
reforms. At a business and industry meeting last night, Kohl said that
now is the time to sit down together and sensibly discuss the issues
again. Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the SPD, had earlier rejected
the offer; in an interview with the TV channel SAT 1, he said that
there would be no point in having such discussions as the CDU/CSU and
the FDP were still arguing about the issue and that there could only
be debate on the topic if some concrete suggestions were put forward.
Hintze, the general secretary of the CDU, described Lafontaine's words
as highly irresponsible, and Friedrich Bohl, a CDU minister in the
Chancellor's office, said that the SPD were trying to erect a
political blockade on the issue. The was also a special parliamentary
session on the topic of pensions in the Bundestag today. The CDU/CSU
and the FDP wanted to push through a rise in Value Added Tax at the
same time as the pension reform, so that an increase in pension
contributions to 21 percent could be prevented, but the SPD spoke
against moving the reform forward.

Residents and municipalities to pay the price for tax deficit
</H1>
Germany's municipalities are to be faced with increased debt and its
citizens will have to pay higher charges because of the current tax
deficit. In an interview with the Saarland Broadcasting Company,
Bernhard (sp?), the president of the Federation of Towns and
Municipalities, also said that certain municipal services will have to
be cut and that it would be impossible to achieve the planned
provision of kindergarten places for 95 percent of children in the
foreseeable future. He also predicted that more swimming pools and
libraries would be closed.

Bundestag Economic Committee agree reform of energy law
</H1>
The CDU/CSU and FDP majority on the Bundestag Economic Committee have
agreed the planned reform of the energy law; this decision will allow
the Bundestag to vote on the issue this year. According to Guenther
Rexrodt, the Federal Minister of Economics, this reform in intended to
remove the restrictions on competition in the electricity and gas
industries, and should lead to lower prices. The SPD and the Greens
dismissed the planned change in the law as insufficient; moreover,
they are of the opinion that the new law should also be discussed in
the Bundesrat, a point which is disputed by the government.

New law against driving under the influence of drugs
</H1>
The government majority on the Bundestag Traffic Committee has decided
that driving while under the influence of drugs will in future be
punished by a fine of up to DM 3000 and the withdrawal of an
offender's driving licence. Although there are limits on the amount of
alcohol which has to be present in a driver's bloodstream before a
prosecution can proceed, for illegal drugs the slightest presence in
the bloodstream will suffice. The drugs which are covered by the bill
include cannabis, heroin, morphine, cocaine, amphetamines and
so-called 'designer drugs.'

agreements.

SPD wants Bundestag cross-party motion on dual nationality
</H1>
The SPD is planning to see whether a cross-party motion might yet
succeed in pushing through a law giving dual nationality to children
born in Germany to parents who are not German citizens. These plans
were rejected by a majority of the CDU/CSU parliamentary party
yesterday, but this decision was not unanimous. The SPD is reckoning
that those members of the CDU/CSU who are in favour of dual
nationality, and above all the FDP, might vote with the opposition on
the issue.

</H1>
Kofi Annan, the General Secretary of the UN, has officially nominated
Klaus Toepfer, the Federal Minister of Building and Construction, as
the head of the UN Environment Program. Toepfer voiced his ambition to
get this job in October. He is planning to take up the post at the
Environment Program in Nairobi on 1st January 1998. His position in
the Federal Cabinet will probably go to someone from the CSU, to make
up for the loss of the Mail Ministry, which is to be dissolved at the
end of the current parliamentary session.

Bavaria to employ 500 new teachers
</H1>
The state of Bavaria is to create 500 new teaching positions at its
schools from the next school year. This was decided unanimously by the
CSU parliamentary party in the state parliament, despite the strained
financial situation. A total of 4000 teachers are currently unemployed
in the state. The 500 new teachers will be employed chiefly at schools
in social hotspots and wherever there are large classes. They will not
be employed full time, but will only get a two-thirds time contract
and they will not be made civil servants (as is usual for teachers in
Germany), although they will stand a good chance of being taken on
permanently at the end of their one-year contracts. The money for the
new teachers is to be found by redirecting resources and from cuts
made to benefits paid to civil servants. The state parliament must
still vote on the concept; the SPD has said that 500 teachers are not
enough - they believe it should be 1,000.

Boetsch calls on SPD to abandon its opposition to new mail law
</H1>
Wolfgang Boetsch, the Federal Minister for Mail, has called on the SPD
to abandon its opposition to the new mail law. He said that the
government has already made several compromises, accepting the SPD's
positions, and that if no new law is passed, then the mail market will
become completely open to competition from next January. The SPD is
trying to enforce minimum standards to ensure that new mail operators
cannot fill their works with 'DM 610' jobs, but the CDU/CSU and the
FDP have rejected this idea. Buri, the SPD spokesperson on mail
issues, has said that the SDP is basically ready to compromise, and
called on the government to continue talks with the SPD as soon as
possible.

</H1>
The Higher Administrative Court of the state of Northrhine-Westphalia
has confirmed that the new spelling rules can be used at schools in
the state. In their judgement, which was issued today, the court's
judges rejected two emergency petitions which had been brought by
parents and which called on the court to stop the use of the new
rules. The judges said that the petitioners had not been able to show
that their children were threatened by a severe educational
disadvantage due to the new spelling rules.
