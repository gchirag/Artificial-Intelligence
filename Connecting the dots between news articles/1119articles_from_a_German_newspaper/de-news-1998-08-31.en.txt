Former slave workers sue German companies
</H1>
Former slave workers under the Nazi regime have brought suit
against several German companies. In New York, a lawyer for the
plaintiffs informed that the complaint is directed against Siemens, Krupp,
Daimler Benz, VW, BMW and Leica, among others. The
Munich lawyer said that the action is being filed in view of the
companies' refusal to pay wages and compensation for services
rendered to former slave workers. Last week, survivors of the Holocaust
in the US had gone to court against Frankfurt based
Degussa Corporation. This company had been co-responsible for the
production of the poisonous gas Zyklon B used in Nazi extermination camps.

Soccer: Vogts complains about training conditions in Malta
</H1>
The first training of the German national soccer team in Malta started with
some trouble. In
the evening, federal coach Vogts was not pleased by the training conditions
his team found
on a secondary field beside the stadium. On top of that, about 200
spectators watched the
first training unit of the German team. But the hosts did not provide any
personnel to keep
the order, so that domestic fans and vacationers watched the actions on the
training area
directly. Vogts did not like that at all.
