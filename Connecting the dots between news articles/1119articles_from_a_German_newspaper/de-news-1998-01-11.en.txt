Scharping announces new initiative for tax reform
</H1>
Rudolf Scharping, the SPD parliamentary leader, has said that he
considers it irresponsible to further postpone tax reform negotiations in
the light of the record high of 4.5 million unemployed. He said to the
"Deutschlandfunk" radio station that the necessary economic conditions
must be fundamentally improved immediately. He continued that the SPD are
still prepared to lower taxes immediately, to make concessions for
employers and families and to limit certain tax deductions. At this
point, Mr. Scharping announced the SPD's draft law in this regard, which
was proposed by Hans Eichel, the State Premier of Hesse. The draft will
be refined over the next few days and then possibly submitted for
consideration to the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament]. Mr Scharping
stressed that the coalition government's resolution not to negotiate on
tax reforms with the SPD for the time being was proof that the present
government was incapable of action.

Geier defends teachers' civil servant status
</H1>
Mr. Geier, the Chairman of the German Federation of Civil
Servants, has spoken out in defence of continuing teachers' civil servant
status.  Mr. Geier said in a newspaper interview that teachers who are in
civil service should not cost the State more than those who do not have
this status, and that they were considerably more flexible. For instance,
they could be transferred to areas where they are needed more quickly. Mr
Geier referred to several comparative studies in this regard. Mr. Mai,
the head of the Union for Public Service and Transportation (OETV), had
called for the civil servant status to be abolished and had said that,
except for a few exceptions such as the Fire Brigade, the Police, the
Judiciary and the state Tax and Revenue Offices, civil servants were not
necessary. He continued that the German civil servant system could only
be understood by looking at its history.

marks went into property, plant or equipment. The rest was put aside for
investment, particularly in countries providing a better interest rate.
