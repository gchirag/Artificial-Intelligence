Slump in number of unemployed persons
</H1>
For the first time in two years, the number of
unemployed persons fell below the figure of a year ago in May. At
the end of May, some 4.2 million people were registered unemployed in
Germany, 220,000 less than in April, and 58,000 less compared to one
year ago. The unemployment rate dropped from 11.4% to 10.9%.
President of the Labour Office Bernhard Jagoda said it is not the
time yet for an all-clear signal. The down turn in unemployment
figures can be attributed to the usual economic recovery in Spring,
a general upswing in the economic cycle, and to an expansion of
job creation schemes. The situation in the New States [former
East-Germany] remained precarious. Moreover, the state of the
apprenticeship market continues to be difficult - in Germany a
total of 220,000 apprenticeships are missing.

<P>
The job market in Baden-Wuerttemberg looks much better. In May the
unemployment rate fell to 6.9%. The President of the state's Labour
Office, Mr Schade, announced an upturn.

German-Russian consultations ended
</H1>
Russia's President Boris Yeltsin has spoken out against a
possible military intervention in Kosovo. At the end of two days
of German-Russian consultations, Mr Yeltsin said a direct interference
in the conflict involved the danger that the conflict spread across
the border lines. Mr Yeltsin announced he will meet the Yugoslavian
President, Mr Milosevic, in person to try to convince him to give in.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl agreed with Mr Yeltsin that it was
necessary to prevent another bloodshed in Kosovo.

<P>
Mr Kohl and Mr Yeltsin called the German-Russian relationship as
being excellent. Since the past year, Germany has been Russia's
biggest trading partner. In the morning, Mr Yeltsin had received
present President of the Bundesrat [upper house of parliament]
and SPD's candidate for chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder for
breakfast. SPD parliamentary faction leader Rudolf Scharping also
took part in the meeting.

Increasing sympathy of youth for right extremism
</H1>
More and more young people in Germany would not hesitate
to vote for a right-extremist party. According to the weekly DIE WOCHE,
the opinion research institute Forsa has found that some nine per cent
of all 14 to 25-year old tend to right-extremist parties. In East Germany,
the figure is even 17%. This represents a doubling of the right-extremist
potential among young people within three years. According to the Forsa
poll, anti-alien feelings of young people have risen dramatically.

Federal convention of German federation of unions
</H1>
The German federation of unions (DGB) have announced at their
federal convention a more critical analysis of the policies of the
Federal government. DGB's head Dieter Schulte said the unions do
not shy away from a conflict with the Federal government in order to
achieve a profound policy change in Germany. At the presentation of
the business report, Mr Schulte said the coalition government and
employers have destroyed in an act of political stupidity the "Alliance
for jobs" called for by the unions. Therefore it is them who are
responsible for mass unemployment. The decrease in unemployment figures
in May would not represent a turn on the job market, according to
Mr Schulte. The DGB will continnue its massive intervention in the
campaign for the general elections [in autumn]. Leading unionists called
for another "Alliance for jobs" at the convention.

<P>
The convention reelected Mr Schulte with a great majority for another
four years as head of DGB. Mr Schulte received 289 out of 360 votes,
that is almost 73% of all votes. Mr Schulte's deputy, Ms Engelen-Kefer
was reelected with almost 82% of the votes. A change of the by-laws to
move the head quarters of the federation from Duesseldorf to Berlin
did not get the necessary 2/3 majority.

</H1>
Deutsche Telekom AG wants to double the price it is allowed
to bill competitors for the lease of lines from customers to
local switches. The Deutsche Telekom board member, Mr Tenzer said
the company has filed a respective application with the regulator.

Telekom and the regulating body for postal and telecommunication
services.
