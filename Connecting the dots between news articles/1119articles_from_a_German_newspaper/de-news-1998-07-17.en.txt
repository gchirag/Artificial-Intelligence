Incidents at nuclear power plants of Kruemmel and Brunsbuettel
</H1>
There have been incidents at the nuclear power-plants of Kruemmel and
Brunsbuettel. At Kruemmel, a safety-nut on a control-rod for the reactor's
pressure chamber had come loose. Control-rods are used to regulate power,
and also to shut down the reactor, when/if required. The Ministry thought
that this was extremely serious, safety-wise. So far this had never
happened before in Germany. Kruemmel had been switched off 4 weeks ago for
maintenance and checks.

<P>
This afternoon the Brunsbuettel reactor experienced an emergency shut-down.
The company running the reactor said that this was due to an operator error.
If there is a danger of the reactor getting out of control, it will
automatically shut itself down. So far no-one knows when it will be started
up again.

CEO Ludewig disputes reports about price-hikes at German Railways
</H1>
German Railways (Deutsche Bahn AG) will not raise prices, according to
CEO Ludewig on ZDF television, and there were no plans for that either.
The debate had been started by a leaked internal discussion-paper.

<P>
Yesterday rumours had surfaced that German Railways not only planned
to run less long-distance trains, but also wanted to revamp their pricing
structure. To better their load-factor, prices should be lowered when demand
was low, and they should go up at peak-times, according to a company
spokesperson in Frankfurt/Main. Details would have to be worked out with the
federal states. Approximately 109 long-distance trains could be affected by
the revamp

Court rules that village has to be resettled
</H1>
The Brandenburg Supreme Constitutional Court ruled against all the
complaints about resettling the village of Hornow in the Lower
Lausitz district. According to the court, resettling the village to enable
opencast lignite mining was not against the state constitution. A complaint
by the PDS-party had been shot down a month ago, for the same reasons. On
27 September, Hornow will now disappear from the face of the earth, and
some 350 inhabitants will have to live somewhere else.

Row over billboard adverts in Bavarian state elections
</H1>
Billboard adverts used in the Bavarian state elections caused a bit of a
stir. The Alliance/Greens-party used the slogan "Mr Beckstein would also
deport Jesus" - referring to the Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein's
backing of re-patriating refugees from former Yugoslavia. A spokesperson
for the Augsburg bishop's office then recommended tit-for-tat, such as:
"The Greens would also abort Jesus". CSU-politician Beckstein said there
would be no counter-adverts. He had nothing to do with the church's
spokesperson's ideas.
