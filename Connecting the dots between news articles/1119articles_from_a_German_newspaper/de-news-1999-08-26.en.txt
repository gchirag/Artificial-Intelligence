SPD-fraction discusses savings program
</H1>
In its first meeting after the summer break, the federal SPD-fraction
discusses the saving program of the government. A general broad approval is
expected as the members basically had agreed on the future program already
before the summer break. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called upon
objectivity prior to the meeting. He also denied allegations that he and
SPD chairman Struck are in a fight over Struck's public statements on tax
reforms. Saarland President Klimmt remained on a confrontational course. He
explained to the daily "Berliner Morgenpost" that a consolidation of the
budget does not mean rigourosly realising randomly chosen data.  In a
report, published prior to the meeting, the left wing of the SPD critisised
the savings program. The authors accused the government of not having made
the changes in politics which were desired before the elections, and of
continuing the politics of the Kohl-government. They fear american
conditions within society.

Bad advise from German Rail
</H1>
German Rail admitted that its personnel gives bad advise to custumers. A
spokesperson said that a study of the "Stiftung Warentest" (a consumer
advisory organisation) confirms their own investigations. German Rail will
introduce better training for their personnel and completely new computer
systems. "Stiftung Warentest" revealed that customers often pay too high
fares because the rail personnel does not know the tarifs. Only in 13% of
the cases, the cheapest fares were quoted correctly. Three out of four fare

Employment acengies about to reach record in finding of jobs
</H1>
Despite an economic low, employment agencies are about to reach a record in
the finding of jobs. Jagoda, President of the Federal Agency for
Employment, said that during the first half of 1999, the agency arranged
1.86 million employments. This would be 5% more than during the equivalent
period of 1998. Such a positive balance, however, would not be a signal for
a structural improvement of the job market situation. Jagoda also
critisised the - according to his impression - slow reduction of over-time
and called upon employers to offer more temporary positions.

Still no compensation for NS forced labourers
</H1>
Former NS forced labourers will have to keep waiting for compensation. The
two negotiators, Otto Graf Lambsdorff and Stuart Eisenstat from the US
government, did not come to an agreement. The main argument was the amount
of compensation payments. The spokesperson of a foundation of German
companies, Gibowski, accused the victims' laywers of broadening the circle
of compensation-receivers. Also the Green politician Beck rejected the
demands of the laywers. Beck explained that, in the case of a final failure
of negotiations with the industry, the government cannot simply use
taxpayers' money to come up with the duties. The foundation will pay
compensation to forced labourers only if they were employed within the
public sector. The negotiators agreed to continue talks on October, 6th in
Washington.
