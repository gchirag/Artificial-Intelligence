Schroeder cautions against inflated expectations
</H1>
SPD chancellor candidate Schroeder cautioned against inflated expectations
of the tax policy if the SPD should win the elections. In Cologne, Schroeder
said that in spite of the announced decrease in taxation for employers and
companies, there would be no significant decrease of the total tax load.
Also the government share could only be diminished slowly. But there would
be a significant tax reduction for normal tax payers.

Demands of further social benefits cuts rejected
</H1>
The trade unions and the government rejected employers' demands to further
cut social benefits. The DGB (German Federation of Trade Unions) interpreted
the so called 'basic security' as an abolition and not as a reform policy.
The realisation of the proposals would lower the benefits below the level
of social benefits. The DAG (Deutsche Angestelltengewerkschaft, National
Union of Employees) and the federal minister of employment, Bluem, spoke out
against the plans to freeze pension insurance's contribution assessment
limit. Bluem declared that this includes great risks for the future finance
of pensions. In Bonn, employers' president Hundt had demanded cuts of social
benefits in order to drop social security below 38%.

Nissan confirms negotiations with Daimler Benz
</H1>
Today, Japanese car manufacturer Nissan officially confirmed talks with
Daimler Benz, regarding a possible venture between the Stuttgart company
and truck producer Nissan Diesel. According to a short press release, no
decision has yet been made, but negotiations will continue during the next
several days. The Japanese media expect the two companies to reach an
agreement by June. Daimler is striving for a one-third share of Nissan
Diesel in order to have a controlling interest. The deal would have advantages for both sides. Nissan, the fourth-biggest Japanese truck producer,
has to contend with a significant drop in sales that led to huge losses.
The parent company, Nissan Motor Company, wants to sell its share of the
truck producer, because of this and its own problems. A share of Nissan
Diesel would also be very profitable for Daimler Benz, because the German
company could realise its long-desired goal to enter the Asian market.
Only last Thursday Daimler announced a merger with Chrysler. Until now,
Mercedes trucks have played no role in Asia.

New coalition talks in Saxony-Anhalt
</H1>
There may be new negotiations in Saxony-Anhalt to form a state government.
SPD state premier Hoeppner signalled readiness for talks with the CDU under
the condition of a joint strategy of all Members of Parliament against the
DVU (right wing People's Union). Although this includes the PDS, the name
PDS would not be mentioned in any published papers. State premier Hoeppner
affirmed, that this would be no tactical manoeuvre. Rather, the examples of
Bremen and Schleswig-Holstein had shown that a fight against the right-wing
DVU is only possible with joint efforts of all parties. In reference to the
federal SPD in Bonn, where the SPD federal executive board met at noon, he
assumed that it would understand this tactic. The federal SPD chairman,
Lafontaine, declared that instead of possible dangers of a state government
in Magdeburg being tolerated by the PDS there would be no interference from
this side. Lafontaine accused the CDU of an untrustworthy demarcation from
the PDS. The East-German faction party CDU is said to have supported the
policy of the SED, e.g. in border affairs. The CDU state faction leader,
Bergner, demanded that a new dialogue must have the character of coalition
talks.

Gysi takes legal action against classification
</H1>
PDS politician Gysi filed a lawsuit with the federal constitutional court,
against his being classified as an unofficial member of the Stasi (Staatssicherheitsdienst, former national security agency of the GDR). Gysi had
announced this as early as Friday after the Bundestag immunity committee
determined that he had betrayed clients to the Stasi while working as a
lawyer in the GDR. The PDS faction in the Bundestag declared that Gysi
wanted to prevent a parliamentary discussion involving his case by filing
his complaint.

Additional improvement by Kirch and Bertelsmann demanded
</H1>
The European Commission will not ratify plans of the media companies Kirch
and Bertelsmann for digital television for the time being. Talks between
the official EU commissioner and company representatives resulted in no
progress, a commission speaker said in Brussels. In order to obtain
approval, both companies would have to offer significant additional
improvements. The Munich-based Kirch-group and Bertelsmann from Guetersloh
plan to merge their Pay-TV channels Premiere and DF1. The technical conditions will be realised by Deutsche Telekom. The EU-commission fears that
this would lead to a monopoly in the German-speaking area.

Future pregnancy consultation of the catholic church still undecided
</H1>
The Deutsche Bischofskonferenz (German Conference of Bishops) admitted its
helpless situation with respect to the future of pregnancy consultation by
the catholic church. The chairman of the conference, Lehmann, said that the
discussions had not yielded any results up to now. One proposal is a consultation letter instead of a consultation bill. But this letter must not
be used to start an abortion. This would leave the church the opportunity
to offer consultation in the case of conflicts.
