Upper House (Bundesrat) shoots down tax-reform laws
</H1>
In its last session before the summer-recess the Upper House (Bundesrat)
shot down the planned tax-reform. Previously Finance Minister Waigel had
already said that he would be prepared to compromise and give the opposition
SPD some rope as far as losses in tax-take, the maximum tax-rate and spending
tax-money on lowering additional labour costs were concerned. But there was
one condition: tax-rates would have to go down. The tax-burden has to be
lowered a bit, but it is mainly about re-structuring the tax-system, meaning
axing subsidies/exemptions and lowering tax-rates in return. Hamburg's mayor
(and state premier) Voscherau once again pointed the finger at the resulting
high amount of losses in tax-take, and emphasised: "If it stays that way this
reform is not socially acceptable." And he also mentioned, referring to
party leader Lafontaine: "We have to clear the huge backlog of reform-plans,
all on hold for the time being. We do need a big reform, but that's not on
a year before the federal elections." Therefore he proposed a small reform
now: axe tax on trade-capital and raise sales-tax and excise-duty on
motor-spirits, lower additional labour-costs, lower company tax and try to
establish a common catalogue covering privileges/exemptions to be axed, and
get that agreed to by both sides.

Mr Thierse welcomes compact on the creation of additional apprenticeships
</H1>
Deputy leader of the SPD Thierse welcomed the agreements between
federal and state governments to create additional apprenticeships.
On radio Deutschlandfunk Mr Thierse said that appealing to employers to be
more flexible had been a step in the right direction. He also was relieved
that the second day of vocational training/week had not been abolished, a
federal government's pet idea. Yesterday Chancellor Kohl and the State
Premiers had agreed on a catalogue of measures to fight the
apprenticeship-crisis: the amount of vocational training is to remain
unchanged, training, however, is to become more flexible.

Another scam in the medical sector
</H1>
The public prosecutor and health insurers apparently are about to
discover a billion-mark scam in the medical sector. According to the
newspaper HAMBURGER ABENDBLATT, cardiac specialists had bulk-bought medical
gear at discounted prices, and subsequently billed the health insurers the
full, non-discounted price, pocketing the difference. This would have
amounted to approximately 1.5 billion marks. The current scam would have
involved more specialists and the damage would have been bigger than in the
previous so-called heart-valve scam, according to the health insurers.

Fight against corruption to become more efficient
</H1>
The fight against corruption both in the public and the private sector
is to become more efficient. The Upper House (Bundesrat) agreed to a draft
passed by a vast majority of all parties in parliament (Bundestag). It
provides for new and heavier penalties, and up to 10 years' jail in
particularly severe cases. The Upper House (Bundesrat) also agreed to
a new tax-incentive concept to promote investment in former East Germany.

Churches criticise how asylum-seekers and other foreigners are treated
</H1>
Protestants, catholics and other churches think that a reform of the
laws on permanent residence and obtaining citizenship are long overdue
for a reform. They want a comprehensive law on immigration, using quotas if
need be. And they want to have any child born in Germany to be a German
citizen, automatically.

<P>
They also referred to the recent spate of arson-attacks on churches,
targeted at priests hiding refugees, who otherwise would have been deported
by the authorities. Whereas there could be no justification for perverting
the course of justice, this sometimes was the only way to demonstrate against
the current laws.

Process of deporting convicted and other foreigners streamlined
</H1>
The process of deporting foreigners with convictions (by a German court)
has been streamlined by a law passed by both houses of parliament. According
to the new law, foreigners may also be deported if they have taken part in a
banned demonstration, even before they have been convicted by a court
of law.

32 of cancer-scientist Herrmann's papers fakes
</H1>
This also goes for his ex-assistant Ms Marion Brach, according to a
final report by a national commission of enquiry. The report also concludes
that Mr Herrmann was directly involved in faking scientific results. And
there are concrete hints that one of the offences was committed only last
year, at a time when Ms Brach had already left and started teaching at the
university of Luebeck. Mr Herrmann originally had claimed that only Ms
Brach, his former de-facto, had been responsible and should carry the can.
The commission claims that they also had found proof that Mr Herrmann had
obtained tenure at the university using false pretenses, and the latter
should therefore be terminated. The fate of some 30 scientists who joined
Mr Herrmann is still unknown. There may be consequences even for them.

Tourists alarmed over tongue-in-cheek television report
</H1>
When German television's 'Monitor' reported, tongue-in-cheek, on
an alleged departure-tax, thousands of German tourists took that seriously.
Travel agents are afraid the damage caused will be worth millions of marks,
with phones ringing continuously since this morning. And there was also
mayhem at the airports. Thousands of citizens called Dusseldorf and
Cologne-Bonn airports, two of the busiest in the country. TV had 'reported'
that Finance Minister Waigel planned to hit tourists with a departure-tax of
150 marks per person.
