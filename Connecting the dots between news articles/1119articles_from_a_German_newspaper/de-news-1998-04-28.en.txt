Health insurance must pay treatment in other EU countries
</H1>
Patients in the European Union have the right to get
reimbursed by their health insurance for medical treatments in any
EU country according to a decision of the European Court of Justice.
Until now, only treatments in the country of residence were
reimbursed by public health insurance schemes. The judges, however,
decided that this practice was not conform to the principle of free
exchange of goods and services within the European Union. According
to their decision, health insurance schemes will have to reimburse
the amount of the same treatment in the country of residence.
With their decision, the judges ruled in favour of two plaintiffs
from Luxembourg whose health insurance schemes did not want to
reimburse the purchase of a pair of glasses in Belgium, and the
visit to a dentist in Germany, respectively.

<P>
The ruling has not been welcomed by everybody. Federal Health Minister
Horst Seehofer called the decision problematic. He warned against the
possibility that public health insurance schemes now had to reimburse
medical services that did not conform to German quality standards.
The health insurance schemes themselves do no expect big chances.
Consumer groups, however, welcomed the ruling.

After elections in Saxony-Anhalt: talk offered to CDU and PDS
</H1>
Two days after the elections to the state parliament
of Saxony-Anhalt, the Social Democrats (SPD) have officially invited the
Christian Democrats (CDU) and communist party PDS to preliminary talks
for forming a coalition. State Premier Reinhard Hoeppner (SPD) said
the talks could start as early as tomorrow. If the talks were succesful,
they could lead to coalition negotiation with the CDU, though not with
the PDS. A grand coalition [of SPD and CDU], however, is not certain yet,
according to Mr Hoeppner. Possible coalition negotiations could well
fail if the CDU's demands were to high in the opinion of the SPD.
Mr Hoeppner stressed that within a coalition government with the CDU
he would like to continue his politics [so far realised within a
coalition with the Greens]. Mr Hoeppner said the negotiations had
to reflect that the CDU is the looser of these elections. The
so-far opposition leader, Mr Bergner (CDU), called on SPD and CDU
to find a compromise, renouncing at the same any ambition to become
a Minister. Meanwhile, within the SPD criticism has been voiced
against a grand coalition.

<P>
In Bonn, heads of the parties and factions of the coalition government
[of CDU, CSU and FDP] discussed consequences that had to be drawn from
the election in Saxony-Anhalt. They agreed on working in the next weeks
on problems concerning small and medium sized companies, public order,
and the situation in East-Germany. Speculations about a restructuring
of government have been rejected. CDU/CSU and FDP demonstrated their
willingsness to go into the Federal election campaign with closed ranks,
and without any new personnel debates. The CDU/CSU faction of the
Bundestag [lower house of parliament] put their full support on
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and secretary-general Peter Hintze. Mr Kohl
urged everybody again to close ranks. Participants of the talks
said, not a single MP had asked Mr Kohl after the losses in the
Saxony-Anhalt elections to give up his candidacy for chancellorship.
Mr Hintze had called for hard campaign against the PDS, and against
a Red-Green coalition [of SPD and Greens]. In a newspaper interview,
CDU/CSU deputy faction leader Heiner Geissler has called on Mr Kohl
not to base the campaign on his person only, but on a team.

DGB ask for measures against youth unemployment; BDA starts campaign
</H1>
The German Federation of Trade Unions (DGB) has asked the
politicians to give more support to the youth unemployed. Due to the
election victory of the German People's Union (DVU) in Saxony-Anhalt,
the vice chairman of the DGB Mrs Engelen-Kefer expressed her concern for
too many young people to be exposed to danger. Mrs Engelen-Kefer also

its action group called "practical job qualification for youth
unemployed". The employers intend to reinforce the offer of so-called
"practical job years" representing a combination of practical work and
seminars in educational institutions. At the beginning of the initiative
BDA president Dieter Hundt seemed very confident that it will be possible
to offer 15,000 to 20,000 of practical training positions in the near
future. So far there are only 3,000 to 5,000 positions available,
mainly in Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria. Amongst others, the project
is going to be financially supported by the Federal Ministry of
Employment.
