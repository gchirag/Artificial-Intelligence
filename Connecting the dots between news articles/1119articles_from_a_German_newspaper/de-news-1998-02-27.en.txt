Euro-participation: Germany meets deficit criteria
</H1>
Germany, France, Italy, and Finland have met the most important
condition for joining the common European currency by keeping their new
public borrowing below 3 % of gross national product (GNP) with Germany
reaching 2.7 %. Both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Finance Minister Theo
Waigel were very pleased with these figures. According to Theo Waigel
they are a result of the sound German fiscal policy, which has to be
continued to ensure the stability of the Euro. Helmut Kohl is now
convinced that the Euro can be introduced in January 1999.

Armed forces video: public prosecutor drops investigation
</H1>
The public prosecutor's office in Schweinfurt will no longer investigate
against seven soldiers from the armed forces, who had produced the
"Hammelburger Skandal-Video". During a press conference the public
prosecutor Karl Brauer stated that the video contained macabre and ugly
scenes of violence, but it did not glorify violence. He also did not
think that the Bundeswehr was ridiculed maliciously, nor could he detect
extreme right-wing tendencies. The seven soldiers, who had trained for
military action in Bosnia, had staged rape and execution scenes in front
of the camera.

Warning strikes: public servants keep up the pressure
</H1>
Several thousand workers have participated in warning strikes in
Hamburg, Saxony-Anhalt and Baden-Wuerttemberg. In Stuttgart the
employees of the municipal sewage plant and the engineering department
met for a protest rally. According to trade unions about 2000 blue- and
white collar workers marched to Hamburg's Ministry of the Interior, and
in Saxony-Anhalt school lessons were cancelled because the teachers were
not prepared to teach. With these measures the trade unions try to force
the public sector employers into putting an offer on the table during
the next round of collective bargaining next week.

Review of German environmental policy
</H1>
The expert committee for environmental issues in Germany has warned in a
report that the protection of the environment should not be sacrificed
in favour of the economic policy. According to the Minister of the
Environment, Angela Merkel, there are no indications that comprehensive
green legislation would weaken Germany's economic power. The expert
committee diagnosed a backlog of reforms, especially in the area of
water protection. Genetic engineering on the other side was a far lesser
problem, but genetically engineered food and food additives should be
labelled clearly. The committee also missed a clear concept for waste
disposal. They argue for more market forces to implement green ideas in
this area.

by Russia, France, and China.

Commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the revolution of 1848
</H1>
The president of the Federal Constitutional Court, Jutta Limbach, asked
all Germans to protect the basic rights guaranteed in the German
constitution. This was the best way to show respect to those who fought
for a free Germany 150 years ago. The state premiers of
Baden-Wuerttemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate and Hesse, Mr. Teufel, Beckmann
and Eichel, acknowledged the legacy of the revolution. A mobile
exhibition about the revolutionary years starts touring Germany by train
today. Another exhibition, which will be on show until 2 August, has
opened today in Karlsruhe.
