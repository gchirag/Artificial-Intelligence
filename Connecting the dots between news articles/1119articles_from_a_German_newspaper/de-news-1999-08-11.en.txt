Solar eclipse
</H1>
The total solar eclipse darkened large sections of southern Germany
for
several minutes.  However, in many places the view of the once in a
century event was marred by cloud cover and rain.  Prior to the
eclipse,
chaos reigned on the southbound Autobahns.  In the direction of
Stuttgart, Karlsruhe, Saarbruecken and Munich, police reported 300 km
worth of traffic jams in total.  A spokesperson for the railways said
all the trains to southern Germany were fully booked, with some even
having to turn passengers away.  Near Kaiserslautern, a 42 year old
driver was killed when he drove into a bridge piling while looking at
the eclipse, according to police.  At Landau in the Palatinate, a 24
year old man was severely injured as he apparently tried to secure a
better observation post on a power pole.  The student suffered a life
threatening 20,000 volt shock and received burns on both hands as a
result.

No new duties for the Bundeswehr
</H1>
According to statements by the government, the German Armed Forces
(Bundeswehr) will not be employed against criminal and terrorist
organizations nor will it be used for border security.
Inspector-General von Kirchbach today discounted a newspaper report
according to which he had suggested the use of soldiers to support the
police and border patrols.  A spokesperson for the Defense Ministry
said
an alleged secret report on the subject contained nothing
controversial
and was merely misread.  The newspaper "Bildzeitung" had reported on
an
allegedly confidential speech prepared by the Inspector-General.
Kirchbach has requested "Bildzeitung" issue a full retraction of its
false statements.

Taxation of capital life insurance
</H1>
The government wants to grant a exemption of up to 30,000 DM as part
of
the planned taxation of capital life insurance.  This was confirmed
today by the Finance Ministry in Berlin.  A spokesperson said the
exemption would be 20% to a maximum of 30,000 DM. The basis for
assessment will be the total taxable payments.  The intention of the
government is that proceeds from capital life insurance will only be
taxable after the law goes in to effect, which is expected by the end
of
the year.  At present, policies with a duration of at least twelve
years
are tax free.

a
result of allowing shops to be open on Sunday.  The Trade, Banking and
Insurance Union (HBV) has requested the town council institute a
disciplinary proceeding against Rauen.  The HBV has accused the mayor

a serious violation of his official duties.  Rauen approved the Sunday
openings against his better knowledge, and thus showed contempt for
the
law, they allege.

</H1>
The investigation of the corruption scandal involving illegal price
fixing in the construction of gas, water and heating pipelines has
shifted into high gear.  The investigators renewed their inspection of

small workshops.  According to the Public Prosecutor's Office, these
companies have been driving up the price of piping for five years
though
systematic arrangements.  The damages to municipalities, public
