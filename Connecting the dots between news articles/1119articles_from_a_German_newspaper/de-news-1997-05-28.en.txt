No agreement on tax reform
</H1>
The divide between the ruling coalition and the SPD on the tax
reform question has widened again. Bohl, a Secretary of the
Chancellor's Office for the CDU, said after a telephone conversation
with the secretary-general of the SPD, that the Opposition seemed to
have no interest in further talks on the issue. Bohl's greatest
criticism of the SPD was that they were not prepared to present their
own plan for the tax reform as a parliamentary Bill for debate in the
Bundestag. He said that the government would still meet the SPD for
expert talks, however. The government hopes to have the reform passed
by the Bundestag before the summer break.

Still no accord on planned pension reform
</H1>
Employers representatives, the unions and employment minister
Blum, have still not succeeded in working out a common position on the
planned pension reform, but, according to the Ministry for Employment,
all parties involved intend to continue the talks on the issue. The
greatest sticking point is the fact that the government plans to lower
pension rates, but there is general agreement that the current system
of financing pensions through contributions should remain.

Remembrance service for soldiers killed in accident
</H1>
A Remembrance service has been held for the two German
soldiers who recently died in Bosnia. The soldiers, who belonged to
Jaegerbataillon 292 which is stationed in Donauschingen, were killed
by rounds fired from a scout tank. Most of those present at the
service were soldiers. Klaus Ruse, secretary of state in the Ministry
of Defence, said in a speech at the service that everyone had been
shocked by the terrible accident. Later in the week, the two soldiers
are to be buried with full military honours in their home towns of
Freiburg in Baden-Wuerttenberg and Guestrow (sp?) in Neubrandenburg.
The two, members of the German contingent of SFOR in Bosnia, died last
Friday. They were checking over their vehicles when the tank's cannon
went off accidentally, firing several rounds which penetrated into the
interior of the tank in which they and one other soldier were sitting.
The two who were badly injured, a sergeant and a lance corporal, died
shortly after the accident. The third soldier, who was also injured,
is now being treated in the army hospital in Ulm.

Bundesbank to discuss revaluation of gold reserves
</H1>
The Bundesbank's central banking committee is to discuss
today the government's plan to revalue Germany's reserves of gold and
foreign currencies. Finance Minister Waigel has sent the Bundesbank a
paper with benchmark figures for the revaluation. According to a
report in the Boersenzeitung (a financial newspaper) Waigel plans to
achieve a distribution of over DM 10 billion through the move. The
newspaper also reports that Tietmayer (sp?), the president of the
Bundesbank, has advised against the revaluation. The Bundesbank's gold
reserves are valued at the lowest level, in accordance with the law. A
revaluation to the current market price could bring in a profit on
paper of up to DM 40 billion.

Deutsche Telekom must allow competitors to use its network
</H1>
Post Minister Boetsch has decided that the Deutsche Telekom
telecommunications company will have to allow its competitors to use
its telephone network in future, including its connections in the
home. He said that Telekom will not be allowed to abuse its position
as the market leader, but will have to make its connections available
to other companies. He continued, saying that Telekom had reckoned
with this decision and has already made offers along these lines to
possible competitors. The Post Ministry also warned Telekom against
setting the price for the use of its network too high; if there should
be any disagreement about the price again, Boetsch said, then his
ministry would give a quick and precise response to the question.
Telekom also announced today that it does not want the government to
sell its shares in the company on the stock exchange. There was no way
that the company would agree to a further sale of shares in this way.

Daimler Benz Annual General Meeting
</H1>
The Daimler Benz company is expecting more than 8,000
shareholders to attend its Annual General Meeting. Last year, Schremp,
the chairman of the board, had to account for a loss of DM 5.7
billion, but this year the company will be paying dividends again
based on present figures and the trend in the current year. Between
January and April 1997, the company's turnover increased by 15 per
cent to DM 96.3 billion. Sales increased most in the other countries
of western Europe and in the USA. The profits are also reflected in
the numbers employed by the company: 289,000 people are employed by
Daimler Benz world-wide, an increase of one per cent over last year.
These positive developments have also made jobs at the company in
Germany safer.

Tennis
</H1>
Steffi Graf has won her second round match in the French Open.
Even though she won 6:3 and 6:3 in 55 minutes, her performance was not
particularly convincing. Graf, who has won the French Open five times
was struggling to beat her French opponent who was ten years younger
than her. Graf's game was not nearly as impressive as that which she
played yesterday against the Argentinean Paola Suarez, which lasted 54
minutes and in which she only lost five games. Today Graf took one
minute longer and lost one more game. She will meet either Naoko
Kitchimuta (sp?) from Japan or Marie Serna form Spain in the third
round.
