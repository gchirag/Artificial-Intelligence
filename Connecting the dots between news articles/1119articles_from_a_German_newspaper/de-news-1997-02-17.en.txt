SPD: No change in nuclear policy
</H1>
The Social Democratic Party have announced that they do not intend to
make any fundamental changes to their nuclear policy. The SPD Federal
Secretary General, Mr Muentefering, said after a meeting of the Federal
Executive Board that SPD nuclear policy would not converge with that of the
government. He denied reports that the SPD had agreed on compromises after
talks with nuclear experts. Mr Muentefering stressed that the document
referred to was not supported by the SPD party executive who were only
prepared to compromise with the government on the general question of
nuclear waste; specifically nuclear waste repositories, interim storage and
transport.

<P>
The SPD Executive Board also agreed on their line of approach for the
coming tax reform talks to be held with the governing coalition on February
24. The SPD will require that there be no significant lowering of the
maximum tax rate, but that taxes for the general population be decreased
instead. They will also call for a decrease in employers' secondary labour
costs and the reinstitution of wealth tax. Furthermore, they will continue
to reject any attempt to tax supplementary pay for working nights and on
public holidays.

Postal workers continue their protests
</H1>
Postal workers' protests reached their high point in Bonn today with
more than 20,000 workers attending a mass demonstration called by the
Postal Union. The governing coalition are to hold discussions tomorrow in
Bonn on the future of the German Federal Post Office. The head of the
Postal Union, Mr Vanharen (sp?), accused the government of endangering
thousands of postal jobs with their proposed changes.

<P>
Meanwhile, the CDU/CSU have reached a compromise with the FDP in that the
monopoly will continue to apply for the delivery of letters. A
Deutschlandfunk Radio correspondent reported that the Federal Post Office
will retain the monopoly for the delivery of letters up to 100g for a
period of four years, but that postal delivery of items weighing more than
this will be open to private competition at an earlier stage.

</H1>
It has been decided that there will be no uniform system for
labelling cattle and beef products in the EU in the foreseeable future. The
German State Secretary, Mr Feiter (sp?), said Brussels where he attends a
meeting
of EU Agricultural Ministers in Brussels, that he did not expect any
concrete decision in this regard. 
<P>
Many EU members were sceptical about
German demands for strictly controlling source, breeding and marketing of
beef.

Lehmann calls for more social justice in proposed tax reforms
</H1>
The chairman of the German Conference of Bishops, Bishop Karl Lehmann, has
called for more social justice in the planned tax reforms. At the opening
of the annual spring conference at Kloster Mallersdorf (sp?) in lower
Bavaria, Bishop Lehmann emphasised that there should be more
differentiation in the taxation of the upper income group, as there was,
all things considered, a large difference between earning DM 90,000 or
800,000 per annum. As part of proceedings of the annual meeting which ends
on Thursday, Catholic bishops plan to produce a social document in
collaboration with the Protestant Church entitled "Considerations on the
Economic and Social Situation in Germany".

Prodi warns against excluding Italy from EU monetary union
</H1>
The Italian prime minister, Romano Prodi, has warned of possible
consequences if Italy should not be included in monetary union from the
beginning. Mr Prodi said to journalists in Frankfurt that this could have a
negative effect on Italy's fight against inflation, which had until now
been successful. Mr Prodi is of the opinion that none of the EU states will
be able to meet the criteria laid down by the Maastricht treaty for
economic and monetary union. He plans to meet with top representatives of
German commerce this evening (February 17).

As many EU countries as possible for inclusion in monetary union
</H1>
Federal Minister of Finance Klaus Kinkel and his Austrian counterpart, Mr
Schuessel, have made a plea for the inclusion of as many EU countries as
possible for the planned introduction of economic and monetary union on
January 1, 1999.  At a meeting in Bonn both ministers stressed,
however, that the criteria for economic stability could not be lowered. 
<P>
As
far as the expansion of the EU is concerned, the ministers assured that they
would support reform measures of all applicants, as peace and security on the
continent was not possible without the participation of the Middle and
East-European states.

Weber testifies in Suedmilch trial
</H1>
Former president and CEO of Suedmilch, Wolfgang Weber, has denied all
charges against him in connection with the Suedmilch receivership and the
bankruptcy of Sachsenmilch (both dairy companies). Weber's testimony, which
had been recorded in Paraguay,  was presented at the Suedmilch trial in
Stuttgart today.

<P>
As a citizen of Paraguay, Mr Weber is exempt from prosecution in Germany.
He mainly used his testimony to prove that his successor, Frank
Staudacher (sp?), was responsible for the decline of the dairy concern.
Mr Staudacher, however, is not in the dock in Stuttgart, in contrast to three
of Weber's former colleagues on the executive board who are accused (amongst
other things) of fraud and breach of trust. Roland Ernst, a building
constructor from Heidelberg charged of aiding and abetting, has
stated that even after Mr Weber's testimony no evidence has been produced
of any illegal activities by his company.
