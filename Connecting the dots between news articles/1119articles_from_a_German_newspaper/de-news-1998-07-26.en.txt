Bavaria's SPD President opens hot phase of election campaign
</H1>
Bavaria's SPD (Social Democratic Party) State Party President,
Renate Schmid, wants to turn the elections for the Bavarian State
Parliament on September 13 into a signal for the General Elections two
weeks later. "We have 50 days to make sure that Gerhard Schroeder wins the
election and becomes Social Democratic Chancellor of the Federal Republic
of Germany", Ms. Schmid said in Nuremberg during the "Bayernfest", the
SPD's opening of the hot phase of the election campaign. The Bavarian SPD
President encouraged the more than 3000 participants to work full steam
ahead for a change of power in Bavaria as well. She said that two thirds of
the population were sick of the CSU's (Christian Social Union) autocratic
rule. She continued that "The small splinter parties cannot succeed in
breaking the dictatorial behavior, only we can do that."
SPD Candidate for the Chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder told the delegates
that a new Coalition for Work is the most important instrument for tackling
mass unemployment. Economists, unions, employers and the government should
get together and decide what needs to be done. According to Mr. Schroeder,
an SPD government should be able to drastically reduce unemployment within
two years. If this is not achieved, he continued, the SPD does not deserve
to be in power.

Justice Minister against tougher laws on child pornography
</H1>
The German Minister of Justice Mr. Schmidt-Jortzig is against tougher
laws to fight child pornography. Instead he wants the police and the legal
system to be given better instruments for investigation. In this context,
the Minister mentioned Bavaria, where specially trained police agents
search the Internet for offenses in the area of child abuse. Mr.
Schmidt-Jortzig said: "Calling for tougher laws of course is cheaper than
providing modern computers with Internet access and training." 
<P>
At the same
time there are a number of new proposals on how to fight child pornography.
Most of them are concerned with the distribution of such materials over the
Internet. The German Ministry of the Interior is considering introducing
compulsory identification for users of on-line services. Also,
investigators plan to use special software to make it easier to find
material with illegal content.

Biedenkopf does not see change of direction in job market
</H1>
Contrary to the view of the German Government, State Premier of
Saxony Biedenkopf does not perceive a change of direction in the job
market. The seasonal development is good news, but the peak of unemployment
is still ahead, the CDU politician said on "Deutschlandfunk" radio. He
thinks that the old job market, where 70 percent of the population or more
had full time positions, is now a thing of the past. In June , the number
of unemployed decreased by 122,000. The government had interpreted that as
a change in direction.

Dispute between SPD and the Greens
</H1>
The SPD and the Green Party are again in disagreement on a possible
government program. More than two months before the General Election, the
Greens are attacking a minimal tax proposal made by Candidate for the
Chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder. The Green Party's spokesperson on
financial policy, Ms. Schiel, said in a radio interview, that someone who
is thinking about minimal taxes only wants to divert attention from the
fact that tax breaks and the tax system as a whole have to be overhauled. A
discussion about minimal taxes makes a discussion about a simplification of
the tax law impossible. In spite of all that, a red-green government could
take the first step towards a tax reform by January 1, 1999.
