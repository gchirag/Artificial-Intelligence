Lafontaine criticizes Schroeder
</H1>
Former SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine has now, six months after handing in his
resignation, for the first time issued a direct attack on Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder. He said that he gave up his duties as party leader and
finance minister because he fundamentally could not agree with Schroeder on
either style or substance in the government of the country. Lafontaine also
said that a different set of politics than that pursued by Schroeder could
have prevented the recent electoral defeats suffered by the SPD. In his
opinion, it would have been better for the government to stick to its
original course.

<P>
Leading Social Democrats took Lafontaine to task. Federal Justice Minister
Herta Daeubler-Gmelin reproached him with damaging the SPD and the
government with his current statements and his book which due to be released
soon. She said that Lafontaine had the chance when he was Finance Minister
to pursue the policies he considered best.

<P>
Lower Saxony's Premier Gerhard Glogowski said that Lafontaine was primarily
responsible for the mistaken politics after the SPD ascended to power.
Glogowski, himself of the SPD, said in an interview: "The problems did not
begin with his departure; quite the contrary". Other prominent SPD
politicians accused Lafontaine of running from responsibility. One SPD
member of the Bundestag, Wieczorek, even demanded that the former party
leader hand in his party membership.

Coalition talks in Brandenburg
</H1>
In Brandenburg, the SPD and the CDU have adjourned their coalition
negotiations without having reached a conclusion. A negotiator for the SPD
said that there were still unsettled questions in every area of discussion.
Apparently, the question of a state budget is especially contested.
Nonetheless, both sides hope to conclude the negotiations successfully by
Thursday.

Run-off elections in North Rhine-Westphalia
</H1>
The downward trend for the SPD continued today in municipal run-off
elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. The Social Democrats did win in
Dortmund, Wuppertal, and Bonn; however, the CDU took Cologne, Duesseldorf,
and Gelsenkirchen. Juergen Ruettgers, the state chief for the CDU, spoke of
excellent results, and said that the CDU was now the party for the Ruhr. The
SPD's Secretary-General, Franz Muentefering, on the other hand, said that
his party had only just got in gear, after the disastrous primary election
two weeks ago.

<P>
Today's run-off results will have virtually no effect on the overall results
of the state elections. Two weeks ago, the CDU became the strongest party in
the municipal parliaments of North Rhine-Westphalia, with 50.3% of the
seats, leaving the SPD far behind, at 33.9%.

Pregnancy counseling conflict
</H1>
The Chairman of the German Bishop's Conference, Karl Lehmann, has not ruled
out the possibility of bishops stepping down if the Pope does not reverse
his order that the Church stop giving pregnancy counseling which can be
used by women to obtain legal abortions. On ZDF television, Bishop Lehmann
said he did not think it likely, but it could be that someone might declare
himself unable to remain in office under those circumstances. Asked if he
expected more parishioners to leave the Church now too, Bishop Lehmann said
that it was certainly a possibility.

<P>
The German bishops will discuss the matter with the Pope in Rome again in
November. Until then, many bishops want to continue with the counseling as
before.

Deportation of refugees
</H1>
Federal Internal Affairs Minister Otto Schily does not rule out the
possibility of deporting Kosovo refugees presently living in Germany. During a
visit to Kosovo, Schily said that it could become necessary, out of national
interests, to force refugees to repatriate. He said that the principle of
voluntary return had precedence, but since the situation in Kosovo was
stabilizing, it would be difficult in the long term to convince the German
population that the refugees did not have to return home.
