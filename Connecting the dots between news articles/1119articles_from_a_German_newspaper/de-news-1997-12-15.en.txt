Government coalition criticizes Green Party electoral platform
</H1>
CDU and FDP have expressed criticism of the new electoral platform draft
presented by the Green Party, saying that the call for raising gasoline
prices to DM 5 per litre was particularly unrealistic. FDP secretary
general Guido Westerwelle called the foreign-policy demands a formulaic
compromise in NATO policy. In its new version, the draft now rejects
Germany's unilateral abandonment of the military security treaty. The
Greens do maintain as a long-term goal the abolition of NATO, to be
substituted by an all-European security alliance. In the area of social
policies, the draft calls for the introduction of basic social security;
instead of the current unemployment compensation and social welfare, the
socially weak are to be paid DM 800 per month per person. This model is
supposed to be funded through reintroduction of property tax, an energy
tax, and a gradual increase of the mineral oil tax.

police spokesman called it the most brutal attack on record in that
region; saying that the injuries were not life-threatening but the girl
was still in shock. It was highly improbable that her testimony might be
taken today. Two young men of about 17 years of age had ambushed the 15
year old girl in Wuppertal in the morning. They ordered her to undress.
When she refused, they drenched her with alcohol and set fire to her.
Then they pushed her down a slope and fled. Police are searching for the
perpetrators but have had no success so far.
