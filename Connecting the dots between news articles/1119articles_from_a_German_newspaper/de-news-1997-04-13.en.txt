Unions want to ally themselves with president of IG Metal
</H1>
The unions for public service plan to ally themselves with the head of the
Union for Metal, Engineering and Electronics (IG Metal) proposal to reduce
working hours with a corresponding reduction in wages. The president of the
OETV (Union for Public Service and Transportation) confirmed to the news
magazine "FOCUS" that the unions for railway workers, postal workers,
teachers and the OETV and DAG (National Union of Employees) have agreed to
raise these demands in their next wage negotiations. They calculate that
the reduction of working hours by just one hour a week could allow 70,000
jobs to be created in the public sector. According to Mr Schauble, the head
of the CDU and CSU parliamentary fraction in the Bundestag (lower house of
parliament), employment has to remain affordable. He said to the
"Suddeutschen Rundfunk" radio station that increasing hourly wage costs not
only makes employment more expensive, it also does not create any new jobs.
He continued that it was, however, not the place of politicians to
interfere in wage negotiations.
