Fewer trainee positions provided by German companies than promised
</H1>
According to the Federal Institute for Professional Education and Training,
the German economy has provided fewer trainee positions than promised for
1996/97. Despite claims to the contrary, there has been no increase in the
number of contracts for trainees. The Institute's analysis has been made
available to the German Press Agency, where it could be seen that although
industry, trade and service industries had increased the number of trainees
employed, there was a perceptible decrease in trainee positions in manual
and other trades.

Bluem denies errors in calculating West-German pensions
</H1>
Norbert Bluem, the Federal Minister of Labour, has denied reports that
West German pensioners have received less money than they should have
due to a computer error. Mr Bluem told the "Express" newspaper in Cologne
that the Federal Department of Statistics had recently adjusted pension
data. He said that such adjustments were made every year and accommodated
in the pension payments for the following year. Mr. Bluem thus claims that
this year's pension adjustment had been in accordance with German law. The
newspaper "Bild am Sonntag", however, reports that pensioners have been
losing out on up to 200 marks a year due to the statistical error.
