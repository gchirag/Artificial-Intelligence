Attack on Chinese embassy in Belgrade
</H1>
NATO places the blame for the attack on the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
on faulty intelligence. A NATO spokesman in Brussels said that the
embassy was thought to be a Yugoslavian army building. The intelligence
was used by the military to program the missile guidance systems. CIA
director Mr. Tenet and American Defense Minister William Cohen have both
officially acknowledged the mistake. They also stated that this was an
anomaly that would be unlikely to occur again. Furthermore, NATO has
apologized for the attack once more. The Chinese embassy in Belgrade was
bombed and destroyed overnight on Saturday. Four people died and several
were injured.

<P>
About 100 people protested in the Chinese capital in front of the German
embassy. The demonstration was peaceful with participants demanding an
end to the NATO air raids in Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of people
yesterday [Saturday] protested in front of the US embassy and consulate
buildings. Fire bombs were thrown into the embassy compound. A spokesman
for the US embassy said that it is a siege-like situation. The embassy
and four US consulates have been closed for the time being. The Beijing
government has been supporting the protests in front of Western embassies
since the NATO attack on the Chinese delegation in Belgrade.

that the Kosovo war may burden German finances more heavily than
expected. The sum of 300 million marks which has been budgeted for

</H1>
The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) has officially nominated Uta
Ranke-Heinemann, a theologian from Essen who is not affiliated with a
political party, as their candidate for the German presidency. At a
national convention, PDS representatives chose the 71-year-old daughter
of former President Gustav Heinemann in an open election with few
abstentions. However, in the election in two weeks only the SPD and
Christian Democratic Union (CDU) candidates Johannes Rau and Dagmar
Schipanski are expected to have a serious chance of becoming the
successor to President Roman Herzog. The PDS only has 65 out of 1338
votes. Ms. Ranke-Heinemann lost her professorship in Essen after a
dispute with the Catholic Church in 1987. The theologian is engaged in
the peace movement and was the first woman to become a professor of
Catholic theology. PDS president Gregor Gysi said that both Ms.
Ranke-Heinemann and the party hope to use this candidacy to protest the
war in Kosovo.

New regulation of 630 mark jobs
</H1>
The Council of German Chambers of Commerce forecasts that the
implementation of the new regulations on 630 mark jobs will 800,000 jobs.
They further predict that only a small portion of these lost jobs will be
replaced by other employment opportunities. Mr. Riester, Minister of
Labor on the other hand, stresses that of the 5,6 million employees with
630 mark jobs, 4,2 million will be better off when they become eligible
to receive a pension. According to Mr. Riester, these laws will test the
willingness of the governing coalition to implement reform. The Minister
also said that if this abuse is not stopped, the future of the social
security system as a whole is in danger.
