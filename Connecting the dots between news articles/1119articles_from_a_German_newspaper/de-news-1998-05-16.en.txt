G-8 Summit Deals With Indonesia and India
</H1>
The G-8 Summit in Birmingham also dealt with the tense situation in
Indonesia.  The heads of state and government leaders of the 8 largest
industrialized nations condemned the violence the Indonesian government
has shown towards demonstrators.  A joint statement declared, "We call on
the authorities to show extreme restraint and to observe human rights."
India also played a large role at yesterday's dinner.  The government in
New Delhi was sharply condemned for its nuclear tests and called upon to
finally sign the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.  But the group could not
agree on sanctions.  Today, Tony Blair has invited the statesmen to a
secluded country home for informal fireside chats as in previous years.

<P>
According to statements by the German government, the members of the G-8
have come to an understanding concerning closer cooperation in the fight
against organized crime.  The goal would be to tackle the problems of drug
smuggling, arms smuggling and people smuggling as a group and therefore
more effectively.

DGB: No More Red Alert Over Pension Fund Contributions
</H1>
"The pension fund has financial problems, the generational contract isn't
working any more, the whole system is urgently in need of reform."  Many
experts start from the assumption that, in the medium term at least,
contribution levels will have to be raised again.  But the German
Federation of Unions (DGB) sees no occasion for panic.

<P>
Engelen-Kefer, the acting chairwoman of the German Federation of Unions,
wants to call off the red alert over pension fund contributions.  In a
newspaper interview, Engelen-Kefer said the contribution level can remain
at its present level of 20.3 percent until 2010.  This is based on an as
yet unpublished report by the "Prognos" Institute in Basel.  From then
until the year 2040, the contribution level will rise to just over 23
percent.  The financial situation of the statutory pension fund is
therefore not that dramatic.  Thus, Engelen-Kefer continued, there is no
justification for a complete overhaul of the pension system, because a
contribution level of over 23 percent was unlikely for the next 40 years
-- especially if one assumes that, by then, unemployment will be halved.
She called the discussion between the government and the opposition over
the contribution levels a political exhibition bout.  But pensions are not
suited to a knock-down, drag-out fight, and reforms are nonetheless
necessary.  She added that pension obligations must be expanded to include
both very part-time employees and the nominally self-employed.

CSU announces directional election campaign
</H1>
Party head of the CSU Waigel emphasized at a delegate meeting the
differences with the opposition. Waigel said in Munich that the SPD and
anybody else who welcomes help from the legacy of the SED dictatorship (in
other words the PDS)  is tearing up the very foundations of democracy.
Waigel claims that is it is a bit much when the party is expected to work
with an ex-Stasi employee, minister of the interior Gysi in taking action
against Frei. Mr. Waigel then said he would say 'Shame on you' to both of
them and that he doesn't want anything to do with any of them.  Bundestag
vice president Michaela Geiger, parliament leader Michael Glos, the
chairperson of the Women's Union Maria Eichhorn and the Federal Minister
of Health Horst Seehofer hold second to fifth place on the CSU list. The
Woman's Union was unhappy. Five women occupied spots within the top
twenty;  their goal had been eight. According to Chairperson Eichhorn, a
discussion over the quota for women in the CSU will take place after the
elections as a result.

Quarrel over radio channel for foreigners
</H1>
There is apparently an intense argument between the German national trade
union (DGB) and the CSU regarding foreigner politics. Both sides are
fighting over a radio program for foreigners. The discussion began with
comments from the CSU politician Zeitelmann. The speaker for domestic
affairs of the CSU members of parliament had attacked the radio program
being planned by the ARD. Zeitelmann feels that it is a bit much to design
a channel for foreigners due to the large numbers of them living illegally
in Germany. The leader of the DGB Schulte reacted to this opinion with the
accusation that the CSU was doing the work of rightist extremist groups by
excluding the foreigners.

economic psychologist Alfred Gebert, who studies the interaction between
behavioral patterns and economic trends, the number of compulsive shoppers
has risen 50-fold over the last ten years. He believes that credit cards
are the principal culprit for this trend.

Volkswagen recall
</H1>
The Volkswagen Beetle has been on the North American market since March
and has already become the big seller.  The Beetle has become the sales
hit in the USA and Canada in just a few weeks, and a regular "beetle
mania" has developed.  The high demand for the new model has led to a
considerable backlog of orders. However, now the 8,500 vehicles sold in
the USA and the 1,500 sold in Canada thus far have been recalled because
of problems with the electrical wiring. A spokesman said there was a risk
of fire if the wiring was not redone.  The company became aware of the
problem due to three customer complaints about poorly working air
conditioning systems. The car's motor cable were apparently damaged by
friction. There haven't been any accidents or other problems caused by
this yet.
