Schroeder livens up "Buendnis fuer Arbeit" with compromise
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder wants to help the faltering
negotiations in the "Buendnis fuer Arbeit" [Partnership for Labor]
succeed with a new compromise paper. The fifth round of talks between
the federal government, unions, and employers is planned for Sunday.
Government spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye stated that Schroeder personally
spoke with those involved and has made progress. The unions and employers
have said they are optimistic.

<P>
The last round of talks broke down in the middle of December due to the
debate on retirement at 60. As a result IG Metall [the trade union for
metal, engineering and electronics] announced the next round of collective
bargaining would be more difficult, because they would set their wage
claims would be considerably higher than four percent if an agreement
could not be reached over "retirement at 60".

CDU leadership stands behind Schaeuble
</H1>
The CDU leadership is standing behind party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble in the
donations scandal. Schaeuble stated in an interview after a closed doors
meeting in Norderstedt, a city near Hamburg, that the entire board was
in agreement that they must undertake everything within their power to clear
up the scandal so that they can again devote the party's attention to other
political topics. However, the CDU also wants to ensure that the historic
achievements of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl will not be forgotten.

<P>
According to the participants, the board discussed the donations scandal for
approximately one hour. Mr. Kohl cancelled without specifying a reason. The
focus of the CDU board meeting are tax and educational policies.

<P>
General Secretary Angela Merkel and Party Vice President Volker Ruehe have
already begun a leafleting campaign in which they describe the Red-Green
eco-tax to be economic nonsense. They claim that the tax presents an
unbearable burden to citizens.

<P>
In the meantime, the CSU has signaled their willingness to negotiate with
the Red-Green government in the tax reform. The head of the CSU members of
parliament, Mr. Glos, stated at a meeting behind closed doors in the Bavarian
city of Wildbath Kreuth that an agreement is definitely possible. According
to the head of the CSU, Edmund Stoiber, their tax concept will bring about
net relief of about 50 billion German marks. The plan will be voted on by the
CSU and the CDU and introduced tomorrow.
