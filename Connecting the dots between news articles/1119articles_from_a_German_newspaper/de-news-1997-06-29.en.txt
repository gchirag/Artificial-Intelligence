Another arson attack on a church in Luebeck
</H1>
 Members of the extreme right scene are once again suspected of
setting fire to a church in Luebeck.  According to the fire service, the
fire was discovered at around 3 o'clock in the morning in the Protestant
parish church of St. Augustine.  The offenders had smashed a window, and
then set fire to the building.  Several swastikas and the sentence "Harich,
we'll get you!" had been sprayed in white paint on the front of the church.
Luebeck priest, Guenther Harich, is known for his commitment to refugee
families threatened by deportation.  During the past few weeks, right
extremists have committed several arson attacks on churches in Northern
Germany.  At the end of May, a church in Luebeck was completely burnt out.
Swastikas and threats against Mr. Harich were found there as well, daubed
on the front of the building.

Mr. Stoiber demands strict adherence to stability criteria
</H1>
Bavarian State Premier, Mr. Stoiber, has again demanded strict adherence to
the stability criteria drawn up for the introduction of the Euro.  Speaking
on "Deutschlandfunk" radio, the CSU politician said that he expected the
government to stand by its word.  However, should there be any watering
down of the stability criteria, Mr. Stoiber said, he would vote in favor of
postponing the monetary union in the Bundesrat.  The criteria must dictate
the timetable for the introduction of the Euro, not the other way around.
Otherwise, Mr. Stoiber emphasized, citizens could lose faith in the whole
project. The Bavarian State Premier also voiced reservations about the tax
reform law.  Among other things, he rejected the taxation of pensions.

Mr. Tietmeyer intervenes in Euro dispute
</H1>
 The president of the German Federal Bank, Hans Tietmeyer,
has intervened in the current dispute on the Euro.  Speaking on Hesse
radio, he said that the upper deficit limit of 3.0 percent of GNP set out
in the Maastricht Treaty is an important reference figure.  However, a more
important question should be whether the public finances of member
countries are really in an enduring and stable condition.  Mr. Tietmeyer
went on to call for the tax reform measures to be implemented swiftly.  He
said this was essential, not only to accelerate Germany's economic growth,
but also as a precondition for public budgets being able to share in this
growth.  The financial policy of the Federal Bank will not change in the
near future, according to Mr. Tietmeyer.  He said, there was no need for a
cut in interest rates.  He also officially denied that Bonn had promised
France it would be able to appoint the first president for the planned
European central bank.  Mr. Tietmeyer said, he personally considers
Holland's Wim Duesenberg to be a good candidate for the post.

Mr. Stihl in favor of return to 40-hour week
</H1>
 The president of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, Mr.
Stihl, has demanded a return to the 40-hour work week without an increase
in wages.  This way the economic position of Germany would be improved
while tackling the problem of unemployment, Mr. Stihl said in an interview
with the tabloid "Bild am Sonntag."  The head of the CDU parliamentary
fraction in the state of Hesse, Mr. Koch, and the FDP spokesman on economic
issues, Mr. Friedhoff, expressed their support for Mr. Stihl's demand.  Mr.
Stihl declared that the unions had introduced the 35-hour week by force,
adding that this had resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs.

Vacation jobs are becoming scarce
</H1>
 Vacation jobs for high school and university students are
scarce, according to the labor offices in Baden-Wuerttemberg. The number of
people interested in jobs far outweighs actual jobs available.  Those who
are willing to take on unusual or less-pleasant work have a better chance
of finding employment.  Employment agencies say that most of the larger
companies were retrenching staff and thus had no vacation work to offer.
