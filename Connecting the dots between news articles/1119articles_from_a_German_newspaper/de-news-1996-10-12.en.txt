Hostage-taking in a savings bank ends without bloodshed
</H1>
A hostage situation in a Hohenlosekreis savings bank ended early
this morning without bloodshed after over 13 hours. The suspect turned
himself in to the police. All six of the hostages were uninjured, and were
under doctors' care in local hospitals. The kidnapper took an anesthetic,
which he passed to all but one of the victims, the police said. The size
of the police force reached 350 officers during the night. Special force
director Rudolf Thoma explained the reason that the suspect surrendered
after 14 hours by reporting that the suspect openly admitted that his
tactic of holding out could lead no further. In negotiations with the
police and the State's attorney the suspect exhibited neurotic, almost
psychopathic signs, and continuously added demands with no demand of their
fulfillment. An escape vehicle stood ready for hours, as well as the
demanded 5 million DM, but the negotiations continued to plod. The 25 year
old suspect, born in Emmendingen in Baden, has multiple previous
convictions, for extortion among other crimes. He was only freed from
prison in Heilbronn this past July. A social worker who worked with him
during his prison time was flown in alone from Mannheim. Only she and the
suspect's attorney were able to successfully influence him, and bring him
finally to the hostages' release.

</H1>
Federal labor minister Bluem denied press reports about the plans of the
Bonn coalition to pay unemployment benefits only after a one week waiting
period. Bluem characterized a similar report in the "Bild-Zeitung" as
false. Also, he said, he had no intention of lowering unemployment
compensation or other aid in order to save money. In its Saturday edition
"Bild" reported that Bluem was having the constitutionality of a waiting
period tested presently by attorneys. According to the paper the
unemployed would then receive unemployment payments only after one week had
elapsed after the loss of their position.

Doering: Baden-Wuerttemberg is not attractive enough to business
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg is not business-friendly enough in the view
of Federal economic minister Doering. Due to protracted approval processes
the State has fallen behind other regions in the eyes of foreign and
German investors alike, Doering said in Stuttgart. The minister had
recently returned from his first foreign trip as economic minister, into
the southern states of the USA. He, along with a group of project
managers, wants to encourage businesses to settle in the southwest.
Doering traveled with forty businessmen and delegates to Georgia, Alabama
and South Carolina, to test the waters for export of Baden-Wuerttemberg
products.

</H1>
The Free Democrats agree that the first part of the planned major tax
reform be enacted in 1998, rather than one year later as the union
planned. A quick change is necessary in the interest of fighting
unemployment, FDP General Secretary Westerwelle told the Sunday edition of
the "Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung". The goal of tax reduction and
simplification has support in the Coalition, but not the timetable.

SPD wants to agree to postage increases with specific conditions
</H1>
The Social Democrats would only agree to the planned postage increase for
letters and postcards in the regulatory council on Monday if a concurrent
broad funding were guaranteed with the postal profits. The temporary
speaker of the SOD Bundestag caucus, Buri, declared this to the news
agency ddp/adn in Bonn. Above all, a binding declaration by Post AG would
be necessary regarding the future number of branches. Buri revealed that
the federal government confirmed only this week that a further closing of
5,000 of the present 17,000 post offices was planned. The chair of the
Union of Postal Customers declared himself against the planned postage
increase. On "Deutschlandradio Berlin" he said the German postal system
was already the most expensive in Europe by a wide margin.

Green Party congress begins in Hannover
</H1>
In the Lower Saxon capital a 2 day congress of Buendnis 90/the
Greens began, on economic and social policy. The party wants to debate its
conceptions of the future of the social state, as well as possibilities
for battling unemployment. Other themes are tax reform and budget
politics. Guests from other parties, as well as from the private sector,
were invited too. The factional leader in the Bundestag, Fischer,
challenged his party to create the preconditions for the dissolution of
the Kohl government. Fischer said that if the Greens wanted to enact their
ideas on tax fairness, the social state and environmental politics they
would need majorities. Earlier, keynote speaker Sager demanded real-world
concepts for the economic plight of Germany. As examples she named the
ecological reconstruction of the tax system, a socially equitable income
tax reform as well as a social safety net rather than social aid. Sager
renewed the call, controversial among Greens, for a reduction of the
highest tax rates.
