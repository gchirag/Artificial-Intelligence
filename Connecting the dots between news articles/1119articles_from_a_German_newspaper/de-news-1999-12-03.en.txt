Mr Schroeder's planned social policies draw criticism
</H1>
Mainly the opposition CDU/CSU-parties were critical of Chancellor
Schroeder's property-tax plans. CDU General Secretary Merkel said in Berlin,
that instead of the promised tax-cuts, more and more new burdens were
planned for citizens and medium-sized businesses. Bavaria's Finance Minister
Faltlhauser spoke out against plans to tax real-estate at a higher rate, as
far as inheritance-tax was concerned. He said that this would jeopardise many
jobs, as it would make it harder to transfer companies.

New aspects of party-donations scandal
</H1>
More and more are asking for the investigation into the CDU party-donations
scandal to be more comprehensive, for example the manager of the FDP Esser.
Referring to an interview with SPD Treasurer Rettig-Danielmeier, Mr Esser
said that the SPD had also split bigger donations into smaller amounts.
Ms Rettig-Danielmeier refuted that claim

Gale-force winds wreak havoc in Northern Germany and Denmark
</H1>
At least 4 people were killed in Denmark during the strongest gale of this
century, and there were numerous fires following short-circuits. The nuclear
power-plant of Barsebaeck had to be shut down, following a short-circuit.
Apparently the high-tide had peaked around midnight in Northern Germany;
Hamburg was expecting the all-clear soon. A freighter in distress is
expected to beach at the island of Sylt. Currently a tug-boat is fighting
a five-meter swell while trying to hook up to the freighter.

Mr Schroeder: give Turkey a glimmer of hope of joining EU
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder spoke out in favour of the EU offering Turkey some
glimmer of hope for membership during their next meeting at Helsinki.
During a speech in parliament (Bundestag), Mr Schroeder said that it was not
on to emphasise Turkey's strategic importance for Europe on the one hand, and
refuse to become more explicit on the political front on the other hand.
Respect for human rights, however, would be not negotiable. The opposition
parties were for extending the EU, in principle. Head of the CSU Stoiber,
however, emphasised that carefulness was not to be sacrificed to speed.

Mr Duisenberg: German government partly to blame for euro's low rate
</H1>
Head of the European Central Bank (EZB) Duisenberg said that the German
Federal government was partly to blame for the plummeting exchange-rate
of the euro. The partly taxpayer-funded bail-out of construction-company
Holzmann, and the criticism of Vodafone's attempt at an unfriendly take-over
of Mannesmann, had had a negative influence on the euro, according to an
interview with the WALL STREET JOURNAL. For the first time since its
introduction almost a year ago, the euro had slipped below the magical
rate of 1.0000 on Thursday night, recovering to 1.0032 dollars on Friday
afternoon.

Administrative Court puts sale of railway flats on hold
</H1>
The Frankfurt Administrative Court put the sale of 110,000 railway flats in
Germany on hold. The court ruled that selling the flats would be tantamount
to liquidating a company-owned social institution, backing a complaint by
German Railways, who had gone to court against the federal government. Now
federal government will have to do without 4.6 billion marks, an amount that
had already been included in this year's budget. Amongst others, a Japanese
bank had shown interest in buying the flats.
