First session about federal budget of 1997
</H1>
The Bundestag (lower house of parliament) started the
debate about the federal budget of 1997 today. Finance Minister Theo Waigel
called it a "budget of responsibility". According to the budget draft,
Dm440bn are going to be spent. This is a decrease of Dm11bn compared to
this year's budget. Waigel wants to limite the deficit to Dm56bn in oder
to meet the Maastricht criterias for the European monetary union.
To keep the deficit this low, almost all ministries have to cut spending.
Most affected are the Federal Labour Office, subsidies for coal mines,
and the budget for personnel. The most controversial point is that the
budget does not contain any subsidies for the Federal Labour Office.
The Federal Government hopes that unemployment will decrease considerably
next year. Only recently the government had to increase this year's
subsidies to over Dm11bn. Therefore, the Social-Democrats (SPD) estimate
an up to Dm18bn higher deficit. The Liberals (FDP) still see some considerable
budgetary risks, as well. Even Waigel admitted that it is necessary to make
further cuts to neutralise possible additional spending at the Federal
Labour Office. Therefore it is necessary to push through the cuts in the
job creation scheme, which are, however, hard to swallow for the CDU deputies
of East Germany. Waigel believes the cuts to be necessary to secure Germany's
position as base for economic activity.
SPD financial expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier criticized the budget draft
to be non-serious and socially unfair. She says the government blocks
budgetary rehabilitation because it does not tackle the problem of high
unemployment. The SPD demanded an amendment to the budget. The budget
debate will continue for four days, though the voting will not take place
until november.

Attorney of Peter Graf refuses testimony
</H1>
In the tax fraud trial of Peter Graf the interrogation of
codefendant Joachim Eckhardt continued today. During the first two days
of the trial at Mannheim regional court, Eckhardt stated that he had known
of payments of sponsors to the firm Sunpark in Amsterdam, which were
then transfered to the Antilles and Liechtenstein. According to him,
Steffi Graf had been informed, too. Peter Graf, father of tennis player
Steffi Graf, and his former adviser Eckhardt are on trial for tax fraud since
last Thursday. Today though, Eckhardt refused further testimony. His attorney
said his defendant is not able to answer questions because of the conditions
in Heidelberg jail where he is kept. The cell is to small and his defendant
is exposed to extortion. The jail director refused Eckhardt's
accusations. It is normal that these cells are occupied by two persons,
and nothing is known about any extortions.

Inflation on lowest level since 1990
</H1>
Consumer prices rose by 1.4% in August compared to one year ago.
Compared to last month, this is a decrease of 0.1% according to the
Federal Department of Statistics. In the past 12 months in particular
food prices rose. The main reason for the lower inflation is the development
in the East where inflation is down to 1,8%, compared to 3,0% in July.
In the West, inflation slighly increased from 1,3% to 1,4%. This is still
lower than the 1988 level, though.

Higher social welfare spending feared
</H1>
Social Federation REICHSBUND fears higher spending on social welfare
when cuts in health care take effect. Federation Head, Ms Martin said
unemployed and chronically ill persons will apply for social welfare benefits
as substitutes for not provided healt care or unemployment benefits, if certain
laws pass the Bundesrat (Upper House of Parliament). This could lead to an
increase of spending on social welfare from Dm52bn to Dm70bn.
