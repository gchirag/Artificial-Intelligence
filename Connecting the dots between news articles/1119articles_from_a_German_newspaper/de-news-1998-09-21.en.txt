German politicians and media condemn transmission of Clinton video
</H1>
All over Europe, the reaction of politicians and media to the publicizing
of President Clinton's deposition was one of nausea and revolt.
Chancellor Kohl declared himself shocked by the way the affair was
being handled. "It's so sickening I'd like to vomit", he said. SPD's boss
Gerhard Schroeder said the transmission was sickening and nauseating.
The media union appealed to German TV companies not to broadcast
the recording. Freedom of the press and of information is not the
supreme value, they said.
Baden-Wuerttemberg's premier Teufel said the transmission of the tape
by public channel "Phoenix" was a scandal. It is unconceivable to him
that even public broadcasting was playing along with this kind of smut
theater. The manner in which the affair is being aired publicly he called
"a disgusting show".

Major parties going after party-list votes
</H1>
One week before election day, SPD and CDU, the major parties, set
their aim at getting secondary (party-list) votes. CDU leadership in
Bonn decided on a general appeal to this effect. Chancellor Kohl
repeated his stand excluding any idea of "great coalition" (meaning
joint Union/SPD government).
SPD chairman Lafontaine announced that his party was going to stress
the importance of secondary votes for candidate Schroeder's victory.
SPD will also reinforce their views on fiscal reform in the campaign.

Metal industry sector strives for nationwide agreement
</H1>
8 years after Germany was reunited, bargaining partners in the
metalworking and electrical sectors strive for a nationwide wage
agreement. This was the consensus reached at a summit meeting
between the industries' employers' federation and the union
IG Metall. Both entities stated that a pilot agreement worked out
in one of the Western regions will be applied in the "new"
(East German) states with a one month grace period. Until the end
of the year 2000, a 38 hour week was established. The "emergency
clause", permitting companies in a difficult economical situation to
temporarily pay wages below the agreed rates, will be extended.

Bavaria upgrades security measures after terrorist arrest
</H1>
Security measures in Bavaria were reinforced after the arrest of
suspected terrorist Salim. State  minister of the interior Beckstein
had announced that the 40-year old Arab confirmed his identity. Salim
also confessed to knowing bin Laden, who is suspected of
masterminding the terrorist attacks against US embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania, although he denied having been involved in the actions.
It is reported that Salim was in charge of finances and weapons
procurement within the bin Laden organization. Bavarian authorities
will apply for a warrant of arrest and extradition against Salim by
tomorrow at the latest. They had arrested Salim near Munich last week.
In the US, Salim is under suspicion of being bin Laden's finance
manager and therefore co-responsible for the terrorist attacks against
US embassies in Africa.
