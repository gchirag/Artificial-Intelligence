Stollmann continues to criticize Lafontaine's politics
</H1>
Independent businessman Jost Stollmann has renewed his criticism of SPD
party leader Oskar Lafontaine. Stollmann said to the "Berliner Zeitung"
newspaper that any business expertise was wholly lacking during the
SPD/Green coalition negotiations. He added that there had been absolutely
no talk of reducing expenditures either. Stollmann emphasized that, in his
view, the problem was that Lafontaine had succeeded in implementing his
political convictions, over the more modern approach of Chancellor-elect
Gerhard Schroeder. Stollmann continued, saying that it was also
Lafontaine's fault that the Federal Economic Ministry was being
"catastrophically fragmented".
Lafontaine, leader of the SPD, as well as future Finance Minister,
rejected Stollmann's criticism. He told the "Sueddeutsche Zeitung"
newspaper that he regretted the businessman's decision not to take over
the Economic portfolio after all, but that the impression he was giving,
that the new government was starting out in the wrong direction, was
groundless.

from the cultural department of the Ministry for Internal Affairs. The
article also says that Naumann has already reached an agreement with
future Foreign Minister, Joschka Fischer, whereby the Ministry of State
would exercise considerable influence on German cultural policies

CDU leadership in disagreement over deputy-leader position
</H1>
A serious disagreement has become apparent within the CDU party leadership
over the question of who should be second-in-command. Departing Federal
Labour Minister Norbert Bluem has told "Stern" magazine that he definitely
intends to run for the deputy-leader position of the party at the CDU
convention on November 7. According to sources within the party, however,
future party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble wants to dissuade Bluem, as well as
Baden-Wuerttemberg's state premier Erwin Teufel, from running. Environment
Minister Angela Merkel is being considered for the job, unless she becomes
CDU Secretary-General. According to the AFP news agency, Science Minister
Ruettgers is the favoured candidate for deputy leader.

Dentists withdraw legal suit
</H1>
German dentists have declared their years-long dispute with Federal Health
Minister Seehofer to be over. Their national association announced it has
withdrawn its pending suit in the Social Court because the fight over
dentists' fees belongs in the past now that a new government is coming to
power.
However, a new fight is in the making, as dentists want to continue
billing patients directly, whereas the SPD/Green coalition agreement
specifies a return to billing through the health insurance companies.
