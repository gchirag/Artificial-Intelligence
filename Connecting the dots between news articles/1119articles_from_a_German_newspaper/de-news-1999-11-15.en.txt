Vodafone takeover of Mannesmann failed
</H1>
The British-American mobile communications group Vodafone failed in its
first attempt to take over Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann rejected an offer
of 205 billion German marks. "The offer is not desireable and its value
is extremely unfriendly toward shareholders." This was Sunday night's
reaction by the head of Mannesmann, Klaus Esser, to the takeover bid
that the head of Vodafone, Chris Patton, had made earlier during a long
phone conversation. After rumors had been spreading for weeks, the
British telecommunications group finally made an offer which Mannesmann
rejected as anticipated. "We cannot recommend to our shareholders to
give up the growth potential of Mannesmann. Our strategy is the right
one," said Esser. Presently, they are feverishly looking for new
strategies in Duesseldorf in order to fight off the British offer.
Mannesmann, Germany's largest private telecommunications provider, is
especially attractive to the British because of its mobile phone shares
D2 and Omnitel with 17 million subscribers. If the takeover should
succeed, it is to be expected that the former historic company will be
broken up and that thousands of jobs could be lost.
The leadership of the Vodafone group is now considering a new takeover
offer for Mannesmann. It is still not clear whether the British group
will start a so-called unfriendly takeover. Mannesmann and representatives of the shareholders recommended to their shareholders that they
refrain from exchanging their shares for Vodafone shares.

Clement to become vice-chairperson of SPD
</H1>
The SPD leadership nominated State Premier of North-Rhine Westphalia,
Clement, for the post of vice-chairperson of the party. SPD leader and
federal chancellor Schroeder made the announcement in Berlin. Clement
is to become one of five vice-chairpersons of the party.
Starting today, all social-democrats will be in the same boat. The
chancellor and party leader was especially keen on conveying this
message to the public after the meeting behind closed doors in Berlin's
Willy-Brandt-Haus over the weekend. This applies to the big topics such
as the savings package or the budget as well as to personnel issues,
said Schroeder. Thus, there is no discussion about the election of the
State Premier of North-Rhine Westphalia, Clement, to vice-chairperson
and that of Franz Muentefering to secretary-general at the party
conference in three weeks.

Stihl demands matching wages and salaries to inflation rate
</H1>
The president of the Council of German Chambers of Commerce, Stihl,
spoke out in favor of raising wages and salaries over the next 2 years
only in reference to the inflation rate. If a reduction in unemployment
were to be taken serious, a development similar to that taking place for
pensions should also prove meaningful for the upcoming collective
bargaining, according to Stihl.
