Coalition agrees on alternative financing for the solidary surcharge
</H1>
The coalition government intends to finance the projected 2 % reduction
of the solidary surcharge on income tax from 7.5 to 5.5 % without any
tax increases. During the debate in the lower house of parliament in
Bonn Finance Minister Theo Waigel declared that the losses of revenue
would be compensated by reducing the contributions to the Debt
Redemption Fund. As an additional measure some real estate could be
sold. The parliamentary party leaders of the FDP (Liberals) and CDU
(Conservatives), Hermann Otto Solms and Wolfgang Schaeuble, termed this
approach an "act of solidarity with the unemployed".The parliamentary
party leader of the Social-Democrats, Rudolf Scharping, however, called
the compromise an accounting trick and a victory of the FDP over
integrity and common sense. The parliamentary party leader of the Green
Party accused the coalition government of having abandoned the state's
interests in favour of maintaining their power. Theo Waigel defended the
reduced contributions to the repayment of the Debt Redemption Fund with
the low interest rates. According to Waigel this has lead to higher
capital repayments than originally projected. The current compromise
sets out that the contributions for 1998 will be reduced by DM 5 billion.
But the government still intends to repay the remaining DM 325 billion debts
of the GDR/THA (privatization and restructuring agency) within
the next 30 years. Originally, the solidary surcharge was introduced to
repay those debts.

interview on Deutschlandradio (national German Radio station).

New NATO members should finance the modernisation of their armed forces
</H1>
Defence Minister Volker Ruehe demanded that the new members of NATO
should bear the costs of modernising their armed forces largely
themselves. During a meeting with his 16 colleges in Maastricht Volker
Ruehe stressed that the costs of the expansion have to be kept as low as
possible. This view was opposed by Mr. Cohen, Ruehes American counterpart,
who stressed that the costs of expansion were higher than the Europeans
presently anticipated. Each member of the alliance would have to share
the burden.
