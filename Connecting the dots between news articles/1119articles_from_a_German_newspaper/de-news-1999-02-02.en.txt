Coalition strikes positive balance after first 100 days in office
</H1>
Social Democrats and The Greens have stroken a positive balance of their
work after 100 days in office, though at the same time they admitted some
mistakes. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said some mistakes were inevitable
at the speed they were attaking the problems. So, for example, the discussion
about the reform of the so-called 630-DM-Jobs went a bit astray. Perhaps,
Mr Schroeder said, Social Democrats and The Greens had forgotten that it
was impossible to fulfil all election promisses within 100 days. As a
consequence, he suggests to himself and to the coalition to relax a little.
The Factions Leaders of the Social Democrats and The Greens, Peter Struck
and Rezzo Schlauch, admitted the existence of problems as well. In the
preparation of some legeslative bills, the project had not been entirely
thought through, Mr Struck said. The new motto for the government's work
will therefore be thoroughness instead of speed. Mr Schlauch said it was
normal that mistakes had been committed. However, The Greens had survived
their crash course in government in good shape (after 18 years in the
opposition, this is the first time that The Greens ar ein government).
The new government had lived up to his election promisses.

<P>
On the contrary, CDU General Secretary Angela Merkel said Social Democrats
and The Greens had not achieved much [so far]. FDP General Secretary Guido
Westerwelle called the 100 days a series of flops, bad luck and mishaps
[the German original is a reference to a "hidden camera" TV show]. The
taxpayers' association reproached the governemnt for having produced
a tax political chaos without precedence.

Riester: "Alliance for Jobs" no toy for bargaining
</H1>
Federal Labour Minister, Mr Riester, has warned employers
to drag the "Alliance for Jobs" into the ongoing labour dispute in the
metal sector. The Council of German Chambers of Commerce had earlier questioned
the "Alliance for Jobs" if it came to a strike in the metal sector.

<P>
Meanwhile, the bargaining has started in Bonn for the 270,000 employees at
Postbank
(the banking spin-off of the German Postal Service) and Deutsche Telekom. The
German Postal Union demands a 5.5% wage rise.

Continuing bargaining conflict in metal sector
</H1>
An agreement between employers and employees is still
out of sight in the metal sector bargaining in the South-West. In the
bargaining districts of Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and of Saarland
as well the bargaining talk had been adjourned without having made any
progress. At the same time, the IG Metall union have expanded its token
strikes: nationwide, 50,000 employees took part in the temporary walk-outs.
The labour actions were concentrated in North Rhine-Westphalia where some
30,000 employees supported the protest actions. IG Metall head Klaus
Zwickel said a labour conflict was very likely. Head of the employers'
federation Gesamtmetall, Mr Stumpfe called on the unions to move away
from their demand of a 6.5% increase to a more reasonable figure.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder asked both employers and unions to take
into the account the broader economic picture and not to forget that
the bargaining will have an impact for longer than just one year.
Employers and employees should orient themselves by the productivity
[gains].

Republikaner offer CDU/CSU co-operation in foreigner policy
</H1>
The far right-wing party Republikaner (Republicans) have called on the
Union parties to co-operate with them in foreigner policy. Mr. Schlierer,
head of the Republikaner hopes that the time has come for joint action with
CDU and CSU. In a letter to Bavaria's State Premier Edmund Stoiber and CDU
president Wolfgang Schaeuble Mr. Schlierer wrote that one should not stop
at a collection of signatures but should go for a referendum on double
citizenship. A CSU-spokesperson rejected the proposition. The party would
not co-operate with the Republikaner. Even in foreigner policy there were
large differences between the two parties.

Bavaria's beer-gardens to remain open until 11 p.m.
</H1>
The favourite outside seatings of restaurants, so-called beer-gardens, will
be allowed to remain open until 11 p.m. in Bavaria. This is the main point
of an amended beer-garden by-law that has been adopted today by the state
government. The by-law allows music until 10 p.m., the last order must be
served by 1030 p.m. and the beer-garden has to close by 11 p.m. The noise
limits and the definition of a beer-garden have been changed. Mr.
Schnappauf, Bavarian environment minister, said regarding Bavaria's defeat
before the Federal Administrative Court that now the by-law was legally
water tight.

Quarrel about teacher wearing a headscarf in school now before the courts
</H1>
The argument about a teacher wearing a headscarf in school is now before
the courts. The Muslim teacher Ms. Ludin has started action against the
Higher School Board at the Administrative Court in Stuttgart. The lawyers
of the German teacher of Afghan descent stated that the school board had
not yet decided about Ludin's objection although the admissible time had
already expired. The Higher School Board had refused to accept the Muslim
for tenured public school service because she does not want to renounce to
wear her headscarf in school for religious reasons.

Wuerttemberg Synod does not share criticism of Union's rally
</H1>
The Evangelical Church of Wuerttemberg has distanced itself from a
statement by its commissioner for foreigners. Last weekend, the
commissioner, Mr. von Bose, said that the Union's collection of signatures
against double citizenship would have a disastrous effect on the
integration of foreigners in Germany. The Higher Church Council stated
today that von Bose had not been charged with making statements on behalf
of the Wuerttemberg Church.
