Partial support for Guenter Grass
</H1>
Government politicians have partly supported author Guenter Grass's
statements on the refugee and Turkey politics after biting criticism by the
federal government. Deputy leader of the CDU/CSU faction Heiner Geissler
said in an interview there was no guarantee that Kurds are not tortured in
Turkey or imprisoned unlawfully. At the same time, Mr. Geissler disapproved
of arms exports to Turkey. The Government Commissioner for Foreigners
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobsen (FDP) said Grass's words contained a core of
bitter truth such as those about latent anti-foreigner attitudes but he had
also exaggerated several points in his speech. For example, Germany was not
a state with arbitrary rule.

Continuing protests against cuts of civil servant salaries
</H1>
Protests against a possible reduction of civil servant salaries continue.
State Premier Kurt Beck (SPD) of Rhineland-Palatinate and Finance Minister
Huber (CSU) of Bavaria are against further special sacrifices. Mr. Huber
said cuts in the social support system of the public service were indeed
necessary but they had to be appropriate. The public service must not
become the nation's piggy bank. He also reminded that only last year the
salaries of young civil servants had been increased to strengthen the
performance principle. The state finance ministers will discuss on Thursday
amongst others reduction of salaries for newly employed civil servants,
reductions of Christmas gratifications, and the abolishment of the pension
equalization.

Immunity of Europol police officers to be discussed by Bundestag
</H1>
The criminal immunity of officers of the future European police authority
will be brought before the Bundestag according to a decision by the federal
cabinet. The European Union wants that Europol officers cannot be held
criminally responsible for offences while on duty. There are constitutional
considerations against this rule. Originally, the government wanted to
regulate the immunity as a by-law without parliamentary involvement. Now
the government decided to draft a law because of the political
explosiveness.

Central bank demands higher net incomes
</H1>
The net incomes must rise to increase the domestic demand, according to
Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank. The Bundesbank states in its latest
monthly report that this should be achieved not only by higher wages but
also by lower taxes. Therefore, the Bundesbank called on the parties in
Bonn to significantly reduce the difference between gross and net incomes.
At the same time, the Bundesbank advocated moderate income raises in the
coming years. To decrease mass unemployment there also had to be more
competitive jobs.

Schaeuble expects compromise with FDP regarding DM610-jobs
</H1>
Wolfgang Schaeuble, leader of the CSU/CDU Bundestag faction is aiming at a
compromise with coalition partner FDP in the argument about "DM610-jobs"
[jobs not covered by social insurance]. Schaeuble welcomed signals from the
FDP that they were ready for talks. He said the argument was not as
exciting as it was presented in public. Mr. Schaeuble, however, did not
want to discuss any concrete plans how to reduce the abuse of
less-than-part-time jobs. He stressed though that CDU/CSU did not plan to
abolish DM610-jobs because that would only encourage moonlighting. Mr.
Schaeuble suggested to discuss the topic in an expert hearing.
The Liberals underlined that jobs exempt from social security contributions
must be retained. Lower Saxony's State Premier Gerhard Schroeder advocated
to introduce a company quota of 10 percent or less for DM610-jobs.

SPD wants to make unemployment the main issue
</H1>
If the Social-Democrats win the next general elections they will make the
fight against unemployment and the creation of social justice the focus of
their politics. Party leader Oskar Lafontaine announced during the SPD
congress "Innovation and Justice" that the Social-Democrats wanted to do
everything to abolish mass unemployment. Germany needed a new government
that understands the economic trade. His party would also make sure that
freedom, justice, and solidarity regain their role as leading principles
for change in society. Lafontaine announced the SPD would start a programme
against youth unemployment immediately after their election victory. They
wanted to give each youth the opportunity of education. When the economy
was not capable of this, the government had to take over. Lafontaine called
for a reduction of work time and taxes, a tax reform that increases the
consumer potential of employees and incentives for environmental
investments and energy saving. According to Lafontaine Chancellor Kohl had
showed that he could not give the country a new upward trend. It was not
the country that was weak but the government.

Federal Court cancels fees for NSF-transactions
</H1>
Banks must not charge fees for transactions that failed due to insufficient
funds. In a ruling published today the Federal High Court prohibited a bank
to apply its fee schedule. The bank had charged customers between DM3 and
DM10 for transfers and cheques that failed due to insufficient funds. The
judges found that the bank acted solely in its own interest when it refused
to carry out transactions when the account is overdrawn.
