Minister Rexrodt will help businesses affected by floods
</H1>
When visiting the area, Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt
assured businesses affected by the floods that they would get quick
help without the red tape, pointing out that federal and state governments
would pool resources to the tune of 40 million marks. This would be enough
to pay out an emergency cash-grant of up to 10,000 marks/case. According to
the minister, more than 900 businesses in the state of Brandenburg were hit
by the floods.

Chancellor Kohl: Compromise with SPD in tax-reform matters possible
</H1>
Gilgen. Chancellor Kohl, who was holidaying in neighbouring Austria,
was confident that there would be a compromise with the SPD as far as the
tax-reform plans were concerned, otherwise this would become an issue for
the upcoming federal elections, and the SPD would then lose them. Come
rain or shine, his government would reform pensions this year, and he ruled
out any interference from the Upper House (Bundesrat) in this matter. He also
declined to comment on plans to change the constitution in order to clip the
Upper House's (Bundesrat) wings, stating that this was a non-issue as no-one
had the required majority for this sort of amendment.

Discussion about scrapping conscription
</H1>
Coalition partners keep discussing the eventual scrapping of
conscription, as well as opening up the armed forces to females. Defence
Minister Ruehe was all for getting females into the armed forces, but said
that this required a 2/3-majority decision in parliament. FDP Secretary
General Westerwelle, however, stated that female recruits carrying arms
should be volunteers only. The FDP is planning to have their party-members
vote (internally) on the matter in autumn.

Vietnamese cigarette-Mafia trial in Berlin
</H1>
Today the so far biggest trial of the Vietnamese cigarette-Mafia
began at the Berlin Regional Court. 16 perpetrators were accused of having
committed 9 murders. Defence counsel were trying to buy time by asking for a
recess, to enable them to check on court staff. The 16 persons use 2
duty-lawyers each. Defence counsel had their doubts if the prosecution had
enough evidence to convict them of 9 murders and taking hostages. In 1996 a
tip-off by a female chief-witness had led to the arrest of the alleged
gang-leader, and she will be very important for the trial. The lady,
from Vietnam, had witnessed the execution of her husband (a Mafia-member).
The accused will be protected by bullet-proof glass and several
police-officers. The 32 lawyers will be assisted by 7 interpreters.

Ambulances refute claims they were cheating
</H1>
The association of ambulance services refutes claims that they were
cheating, claiming that 99% of them would file claims with public health
insurers without fiddling. The system was to blame, not individuals. A mere
1% of the 11,000 ambulance services had got into the firing-line because of
manipulations. The paperwork, however, had grown over the years, quite often
becoming too much for many staff, but they intend to fix that with more
staff training.

Baden-Wuerttemberg public health insurers do not plan to give refunds
</H1>
Contrary to what the public health insurers in the states of
Berlin, Hamburg and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania did, Baden-Wuerttemberg
was not planning to refund contributions. In return, they intended to cap the
current contribution-rates at 13% until the end of 1998. Refunding
contributions to patients who had made little or no claims had raised other
insurers' hackles.

Today the trial of Mr Kai Diesner, who allegedly killed a police
officer, began at the Higher Regional Court. Prior to the trial Mr Diesner,
a right-wing radical, had already admitted to having shot a police officer
at a road-block, though he denied that this was murder, claiming that he
did what he did because he hated government. A few days before the killing,
the 24-year old had caused grievous bodily harm to a Berlin bookseller.

Skinheads attack campers on the shores of Lake Constance
</H1>
Friedrichshafen/Lake Constance. Skinheads attacked a group of young people
holidaying at a campground at Hagnau, injuring two persons. The youths aged
between 16 and 18 years came from the Suebian Alps and wanted to have a
week's holiday on the shores of Lake Constance. The attack lasted for a mere
two minutes. Supposedly the skinheads had been evicted the day before for
having been too noisy and unruly, and that was their way of getting back at
the 'system'. The caretaker thought they originated from the Ludwigsburg
area, and from his memory they had been to this campground before, together
with their parents. That's why their faces looked familiar to him.
