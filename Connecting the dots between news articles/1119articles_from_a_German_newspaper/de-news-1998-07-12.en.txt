Waigel proposed adjustment of EU contributions
</H1>
In the dispute regarding future financing of the EU budget, German
Minister of Finance Theo Waigel has rejected demands by Southern European
states. Portugal and Greece support the proposition by Spain to calculate
contributions based on the per-capita income of a member state. Mr.
Waigel told the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag" that is completely
unrealistic. This would mean that Germany would have to contribute up to
8 billion Marks more. Mr. Waigel stressed that he will lobby hard to
reduce the burden on Germany. With a net contribution of 22 billion
Marks, Germany contributes the most European Union coffers.

Legal limits for radioactivity too high
</H1>
According to experts, the risks of radiation are higher than was believed
so far. They say that the legal limits have to be tightened. The laws
defining those limits have been based on incorrect data. Radiation
experts have pointed out that present limits were set in the 50s. At that
time it was not known that low doses of radiation can cause cancer. New
insights from Hiroshima, nuclear tests and the reactor accident of
Chernobyl have not been taken into account when the limits were put into
law.

Hospital surcharge can be deducted from taxes
</H1>
The special fee which members of public health insurances for the
maintenance of hospitals have to pay can be deducted from taxes. A
spokesman of the Ministry of Finance confirmed the validity of a
newspaper report today in Bonn which claims that the so-called hospital
emergency fund of 20 Marks can be deducted from annual taxes in the same
way health insurance premiums are deducted. The surcharge has to be paid
in 1997, 1998 and 1999 by approximately 40 million medically insured. It
does not have to be paid by civil servants and members of private health
insurance schemes.
