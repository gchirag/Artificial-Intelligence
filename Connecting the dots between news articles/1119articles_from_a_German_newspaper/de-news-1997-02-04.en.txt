SPD rejects reduction of maximum income tax rate
</H1>
The Social-Democrats reject reform plans by the government to reduce the
maximum tax rate for personal incomes from 53 to 39 percent. SPD
secretary-general Oskar Lafontaine commented that the maximum tax rate must
remain at the current level because the constitution stipulates that people
must be taxed according to their [financial] capabilities. Therefore, a
trained worker cannot be put at the same level as an executive board
member, a chancellor or a state premier.

Cabinet discusses situation of German Agriculture
</H1>
Today, the federal Cabinet dealt with the new report on the situation of
the German agriculture. One topic was the resurfaced BSE crisis that
already affected the German beef market. According to a report by the daily
Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung the number of farming enterprises in
Germany has declined by 3% to about 540,000 farms. However, the winnings of
the farmers have increased by 6.6%.
The farming report, however, is for the period ending June 1996. This means
that the financial losses due to cattle pest and swine plague have not been
included. Therefore the government expects losses as the whole-year average.

CDU continues to back Bluem
</H1>
The Christian-Democrats continue to back Federal Labour Minister Norbert
Bluem in the pension debate. Last night, at an event celebrating the 50th
anniversary of the Ahlen CDU platform, Bluem was given demonstrative
applause. At the event in Ahlen, North-Rhine Westphalia, Chancellor Helmut
Kohl said the reform proposals by Bluem were a good base for further
discussion. Kohl assured he would have the pension reform passed as quickly
as possible because Germany must be fit for the next century. Incisive
changes were therefore necessary.
Meanwhile, the Liberal FDP has warned against a co-operation between Bluem
and the SPD in matters of pension reform. Ms. Babel, the FDP's social
expert, said in an interview, such a co-operation without the FDP would be
a misfortune for the German people. Yardstick for the pension reform must
be the stability of pension contributions. For the FDP the upper limit is
20 percent. Ms. Babel said: "For us, the Bluem proposal to increase
contributions to 22.9 percent is not acceptable."

Train with atomic waste containers derailed
</H1>
A goods train carrying German nuclear waste has derailed this morning on
its way to the British reconditioning facility in Sellafield. According to
police the accident near Apach, Lorraine, did not cause an increase of
radioactivity. No-one was injured. The accident has presumably been caused
by a shunting mistake. The casks containing exhausted fuel rods from the
nuclear reactor Emsland in Lower Saxony were undamaged.

Comments on derailed nuclear waste transport
</H1>
A ministry spokesman in Saarbruecken stated that police did not want to
exclude the possibility of an attack on the nuclear transport. Police are
investigating whether the rails were broken. Another explanation is that
the train was too heavy.
The Saarland state government called for consequences. More than 120
nuclear waste transports cross roads and rails of Saarland annually. SPD
Minister of Environment Leonard (sp?) repeated his demand to send nuclear
waste by ship instead of by lorry or train. This, however, is rejected by
people living near North Sea or Baltic Sea ports.

Inner security less threatened
</H1>
The threat of Germany's inner security by terrorist organizations has
declined according to Prosecutor-General Nehm. At the annual press
conference Mr. Nehm was optimistic. Terrorist group Red Army Faction and
right-wing terrorism have become almost insignificant, and terrorists of
the Kurdish PKK have come to political reason. Nehm criticized violent
attacks on nuclear transports because the groups abused the freedom of
assembly. Iran's threat of violence against judges and prosecutors in the
Mykonos-trial was a threat to justice.
