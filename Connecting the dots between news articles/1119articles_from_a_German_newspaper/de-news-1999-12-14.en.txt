Agreement on compensation for forced labourers
</H1>
The negotiations for a compensation of forced labourers in Nazi-Germany
have come to an agreement, says the Jewish World Congress. The JWC
stated further that US Foreign Minister Madelaine Albright and US
negotiator Stuart Eizenstat will fly to Germany to sign the treaty.
Apparently, the German government has guaranteed that the German
contribution to compensate the forced labourers will be raised from
eight to ten million marks. One half of the amount will be covered by
the German government, the other half by a group of German companies.
At the traditional fall meeting of State Premiers on Thursday,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will try to get the federal states to
contribute to the government share.

the finding of the Hesse Administrative Court. Thus, a PKK member can
still be considered an asylum seeker if he were threatened by political
persecution after returning to Turkey.

for 1999. Starting next year, welfare, pension and unemployment
insurance payments will be tied to the inflation rate. The government
had assumed that the prices would increase by 0.7% on an annual average
when it was presenting the austerity package.
