New financing concept for EU?
</H1>
EU budget commissioner designate Ms. Schreyer is considering EU
taxes. The Buendnis90/Gruene politician said in an interview with the
Hamburg magazine "Stern" that this option should be discussed. The EU
should become more independent in deciding about its revenue. Those who
decide about expenditures should also be responsible to the citizens for
the revenue. Schreyer added that this was not about a higher financial
burden but a different financing scheme. Currently, EU revenue comes mostly
from contributions of the member states.

LWS affaire: Stoiber rejects personal responsibility
</H1>
Bavarian State Premier Edmund Stoiber rejects any personal
responsibility in the LWS affaire for the losses of millions of marks. The
suggestion that he was always informed about each real estate transaction
and, thus, that he was responsible, was off the track, said Stoiber. At a
press conference he announced the resignation of the current LWS upervisory
board. The CSU chief also strongly incriminated the discharged Minister of
Justice, Mr. Sauter. In the presence of Sauter, Stoiber said a supervisory
board president who excuses himself with that even he was not informed and
who despite the incomplete information had trusted the executive board was
ignorant of his tasks and duties. The fired justice minister had
participated in today's cabinet meeting against Stoiber's will to justify
himself again. Sauter rejects the sole responsibility for the LWS's losses
of 367 million marks. The Bavarian government still expects more losses. A
list of measures adopted today is to improve the supervision of
government-owned companies in the future.

Little change of job market situation
</H1>
The situation of the job market is nearly unchanged. The Federal
Labour Office reports that the number of unemployed decreased by 3400 in
July to just under 4.024 million in August. The unemployment rate stayed at
103 percent. There were 72'000 fewer unemployed than in August of last
year. In Baden-Wuerttemberg the number of unemployed increased slightly,
contrary to the federal trend. State-wied there were 323'000 people without
a job or just under 7000 more than in July. The unemployment rate was 6.4
percent. In view of the unchanging high rate of unemployment the German
federation of unions (DGB) called on the government to put economic
development first. The DGB thinks that the released numbers show that the
weak economic growth prevented an improvement of the job market. Deputy
president of CDU/CSU faction of the Bundestag Dr. Herman Kues accused
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of failure in fighting unemployment.Deputy
FDP-president Rainer Bruederle called the situation a disaster of red-green
policy.
