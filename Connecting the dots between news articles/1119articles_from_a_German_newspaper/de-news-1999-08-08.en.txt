Discussion of Sunday shopping continues
</H1>
Members of the CDU/CSU, as well as members of the SPD, and the FDP, have
voiced their reluctance to violate Sundays as a day of rest.
The German Industry and Trade Commission (DIHT) has called for stores to
be allowed to set their own hours on workdays. According to the
Commission, such a move could ease the urgency of the Sunday-shopping
debate.
<P>
The highest drama in the debate so far occurred today. About 100 shops
were open for the second Sunday in a row in Halle, and the throngs of
shoppers were met by protesting labour union members handing out pamphlets
saying "Leave me in peace on Sundays". While protests have been growing
all over the country, merchants in Halle announced record sales today.
Shops in Dessau remained closed. The Kaufhof department store on the
Alexanderplatz square in Berlin, which was the center of the Sunday
offensive last week, also remained closed.

Eichel defends austerity budget
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Hans Eichel has defended his savings plans
against fierce criticism from trade unionists and the left wing of the
SPD. Speaking at the 50th anniversary celebrations of the German Postal
Union in Cologne, Eichel said that while the plan was a bitter pill to
swallow, it was nonetheless essential medicine. He said he would not
apologize for doing the clean-up work on the errors committed by the
former government. Eichel also said it would be impossible to keep social
services outside of the cuts, as around 40 percent of government
expenditures were incurred there.

SPD/Greens want higher inheritance tax
</H1>
Giving ever-increasing inheritance wealth in Germany, more and more SPD
and Green Party members are speaking out in favour of higher inheritance
taxes. SPD social policy expert, Dressler, told Bild magazine that wealth
acquired as a gift could not, on principle, be treated differently from
wealth acquired through work. Lower Saxony's State Premier Glogowski
insisted that any changes must not affect the small home-owner.
The labour unions reject the entire suggestion.

Calls for regulatory body in energy market
</H1>
Given the fierce battle going on in the electrical energy market, calls
for a body to regulate the industry are becoming more insistent.
SPD and Green politicians have come out in favour of an authority which
would oversee the market, similar to the one which watches telephone
rates. SPD energy expert, Scheer, justified the move, telling Bild
magazine that there was the danger of the energy giants engaging in unfair
practices to drive the smaller electrical providers out of business.

New discussion of Catholic pregnancy counselling
</H1>
The Archbishop of Fulda, Dueba, is calling for a new discussion of
participation by the Catholic Church in state-sanctioned pregnancy
counselling. Only is June had the Council of German Bishops reached an
agreement to conclude the certificate issued after pregnancy counselling
with a sentence saying "This certificate may not be used in order to
obtain an abortion". Dueba told the Welt newspaper that that was a
labelling swindle, disobeying the Pope and threatening the credibility of
the Church. Dueba also criticized the chairman of the Bishop's Council,
Lehmann. He said that Lehmann initially also considered the agreed
solution to be impossible, but his objections were gnawed away by his
legal counsel.

Germany world's second-largest arms exporter
</H1>
Washington, USA. Last year, Germany was the second-largest exporter of
arms in the world, second only to the United States. According to an
American study, Germany sold abroad weapons worth approximately 5.5
billion US dollars. The United States topped that with over 7 billion
dollars. The most weapons were bought by such countries as Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirate, Malaysia, and Egypt. Compared to previous years,
however, weapons sales are down significantly. The report indicates the
cause for that change lies in the financial crisis in Asia, and financial
problems in Third World countries.
