Initial reading of bill regarding the nest egg subsidy
</H1>
The Bundestag debated the first reading of the bill regarding the nest egg
building subsidy.  The coalition's plans specify an increase in the income
limit for the employee bonus for single persons to 35,000 DM, and for
married persons to 70,000 DM.  For targeted home ownership savings, as
before, a maximum of 936 DM per year with a savings bonus of 10%
will apply.  For investments taking the form of participation in an
enterprise, there will be an additional annual subsidy in the future of 800
DM in the West and 1000 DM in the East.  The bonus for this will amount to
20%.  The opposition criticized the bill, saying it was not enough.  SPD
delegate Schreiner referred to the fact that his faction had already made
legislative proposal two years ago with substantially higher income limits.
