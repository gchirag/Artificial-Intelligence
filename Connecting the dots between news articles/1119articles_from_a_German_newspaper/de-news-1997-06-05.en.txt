Health insurers in the red, despite savings measures
</H1>
Public health insurers continue to be in the red, after the first quarter of
the year.  The total deficit amounts to 2.5 billion marks, Minister of Health
Seehofer said.  The reason for this is that the insurers have accumulated
high debts in previous years.  Even though cuts have been effective in
administration, sick pay, rehabilitation and advertising since the beginning
of the year, these savings were dissipated by higher costs of in-patient care
and a large volume of dental treatments, the latter arising from wide-spread
anxiety about the health care reform which drove people to get new dentures
before the new legislation came into force.  Mr. Seehofer stressed that
the debates about the reform are over now and that the Bundestag will put
the new laws in effect on July 1st.  He defended the DM 5 flat deductible
therein as being necessary to fund medical progress.

Tenant association against passing operating expenses onto rent-payers
</H1>
The German Association of Tenants has criticized the fact that, according
to a government bill, property owners can continue passing operating
expenses onto tenants.  The Association's director, Mr. Rips, said in the
newspaper "Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung" that this would be inviting abuse.
In the interest of millions of households, a fundamental reform is
necessary, he demanded.  In the future only expenses such as water or
heating, which vary according to consumption, should be picked up by the
rent-payer.  All other operating expenses should become part of the rent.
Mr. Rips pointed out that the cost for utilities exploded last year.  This
is compounded by municipal fees which, for many households, have reached
unbearable levels.

Disputes over new environmental laws
</H1>
Environmental organizations have protested against new environmental
legislation passed by the Bundestag.  The President of "Bund fuer Umwelt und
Naturschutz" [Organization for Environmental Protection], Mr. Weinzier, said
the law is a slap in the face of environmental protection.  The SPD-run
states intend to block the law in the Bundesrat.  In particular the
Opposition criticized the fact that farmers are being given a green light
for the excessive use of fertilizers.  SPD environmental expert Ulrike
Mehl accused the government of failing to set clear guidelines for
environmentally compatible farming, and instead doing the opposite by
declaring current agricultural methods as standard.  Environmental
Minister Angela Merkel defended the law: "Nature is always influenced by
man.  What is our guiding example?  The 11th or the 12th century?  We
have to accept that the environment has changed with man, and there cannot
be a group within society who protects the environment for its own sake,
while stigmatizing the rest of the world as evil and destructive."

Opposition accuses government of obstinacy over issue of immigration
</H1>
The parties of the opposition have accused the government of blocking the
reform of naturalization regulations and the updating of immigration
legislation.  During a discussion of several proposals put forward by SPD
and The Green Alliance for a liberal immigration law, the SPD expert for
domestic policy, Ms. Sonntag-Wolgast, described the government's attitude
as obstinate.  She and Mr. Oezdemir (The Greens) both endorsed granting
German citizenship to German-born children of foreigners automatically.
The spokesman on Interior Policy for CDU/CSU, Mr. Marschewski, underscored
that the Coalition will reform immigration law before the end of the
legislative term.  He rejected the general admission of dual citizenship
just as much as a legally fixed immigration quota.

Prison terms for ex-soldiers
</H1>
Almost three months after the assault on foreigners in Detmold, five former
Bundeswehr soldiers have been sentenced to prison terms or youth detention.
The principal perpetrator has to go to jail for 14 months.  The four
co-defendants were sentenced to eight and six months in prison or juvenile
correction centers with the possibility of parole.  The Detmold Regional
Court found them guilty of inflicting severe bodily harm.  In March, the
former soldiers had assaulted a Turk and two Italians with baseball bats
and knives.  The presiding judge called the deed an act of racial hatred.
Two of the defendants admitted sympathizing with right-wing parties.
After the incident, the soldiers were discharged from the Bundeswehr.
