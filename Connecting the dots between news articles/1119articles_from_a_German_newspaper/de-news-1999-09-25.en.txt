Green fight over future leadership structure
</H1>
The fight over the future leadership structure of the Green Party heated
up. While one of the speakers of the executive committee, Antje Radcke,
spoke out in favor of the present dual leadership structure, her
colleague, Gunda Roestel, said she was for ending it.  In an interview,
Roestel said that anyone who wanted to end the unholy feuding among
factions that has been going on in the Greens must abolish the dual
leadership set up.

<P>
Environmental Minister Juergin Trittin agreed with Radcke in rejecting
Roestel's call to abolish the dual leadership.  He said there was no
majority in the party for this position.  He said abolishing the dual
leadership would be in no way a reform.

<P>
In contrast, Representative Cem Oezdemir said the Greens stood before a
crossroads.  The problem with the current set up, according to Oezdemir,
is that the Greens are trapped in a structure suited to opposition.  This
has to come to an end.

<P>
Luettkes, the Green candidate for Mayor of Cologne, was somewhat
critical of how the dual leadership had performed thus far.  She said it
was imperative for there to be competent leadership, and she was not sure
this has been the case.

Strengthening the European Union
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and the French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin have spoken out in favor of strengthening the European Union. At a
German-French conference at Genshagen in Brandenburg, Schroeder said that
German and French citizens have to be committed to building Europe and to
completing the work of unification. A lasting peace can only be ensured if
Europe does not end at Poland's western border. This is the lesson learned
from the Kosovo conflict, he added.  Jospin proclaimed that Germany and
France are friends and that their relationship is the basis of the
European unification process. It is important to accept each other and
remain able to compromise, Jospin stressed.

Return of the refugees
</H1>
Federal Minister of the Interior Otto Schilly and the head of the UN
mission in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner have called for a voluntary return of
the refugees now in Germany. Both made the announcement after talks in
Pristina. Schilly presented the UN leadership in Kosovo with a draft for
an agreement on practical issues such as the means of transportation for
the trip home. At the meeting, Mr. Kouchner spoke of doubling the UN
police force to 6,000 men. This should greatly improve communication. The
Interior Minster also met with HashimThaci, the leader of the

German Rail rejects the one-track idea for the Transrapid
</H1>
German Rail is unanimously against a plan to construct the Transrapid as a
single track system between Hamburg and Berlin.  A spokeswoman for German
Rail confirmed a report by "Bild am Sonntag" magazine.  "Bild" said that
former Transportation Minister Franz Muenterfering had suggested the idea
of building only a single track, and after an internal review, German Rail
had rejected the idea as uneconomic.  The spokeswoman said German Rail had
only agreed to the construction of the magnetic suspension train on the
assumption that there would be two tracks.  According to "Bild am
Sonntag," German Rail also turned down the idea for technical reasons.
One German Rail manager was quoted as saying, with a single track, if one
train broke down, the whole route would come to a halt.

Pregnancy counselling debate
</H1>
The head of the Lutheran council in Germany called on Catholic Bishops to
resist the demands of the pope.  German Bishops, he said, rather than the
pope, should decide what to do about pregnancy counseling.  The Bishop of
Hamburg, Hans Jochen Jaschke, said that, compared with abortion,
contraception was a lesser evil.  He said that, in certain situations,
condoms could be an important aid.
