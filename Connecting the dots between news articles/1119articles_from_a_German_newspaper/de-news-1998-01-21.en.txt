Kohl calls for "great efforts" from CDU Congress on Innovation
</H1>
Germany must undertake great efforts to remain internationally
competitive according to Chancellor Kohl.  Instead of many small
steps, a large jump is necessary, said the leader of the CDU at his
party's Congress on Innovation in Bonn.  He conceded that a large
decrease in umemployment could no longer be counted on this year and
said that the key to new jobs is innovation in science and technology.
 The Chancellor called on employers to fulfill their social
responsibilities.  Firms should not simply caal for ever greater cuts
to the social and welfare system.  The Social Democrats and Buendnis
90/The Greens critized the Congress on Innovation.  SPD
Secretary-General Meuntefering explained from Bonn that the CDU/CSU
government had driven research activities to a historical low, and
thus ideas for innovative products had been suffocated at birth.

Metal industry employers welcome union's offer of reform
</H1>
Werner Stumpfe, chair of the employers' association "Gesamtmetall",
welcomed the offer of the trade union "IG Metall" to reform the
industry-wide wage agreements.  It is a positive sign that the trade
union realized the need for reform of the industry-wide agreements,
Stumpfe told the economic news agency ADX. IG Metall had previously
admitted that in many respects, the wage agreements lagged far behind
developments in the industry. The union wants to speak with employers
in all districts about reform, said IG-Metall President Zwickel after
a closed conference of his organization in Frankfurt/Main.  The trade
union still rejects the firms' call for flex time of between 30 and 40
hours a week.  Moreover, Zwickel warned the employers not to undermine
the wage agreement system.

German Catholics: withdrawal of counseling would be 'criminal'
</H1>
Prior to the official arrival of the Papal letter, the Central
Committee of German Catholics (ZDK) affirmed their intention to
continue providing counseling for pregnant women.  Mayer, The
president of the organization, said in Bonn that through the work of
Catholic establishments, the lives of thousands of children had been
saved annualy.  A pull back would amount to a 'criminal' failure to
give assistance.  The ZDK therefore sees it as their duty to preserve
the possibility for Catholics, in the context of the legal system, to
continue in service to life.

Caritas: more and more Germans are living in poverty
</H1>
The Caritas association sees more and more German families and single
parents slipping into poverty.  It stinks to high heaven that it is
financially rewarding not to have children, said President Buschmann
of the German Caritas association in Frankfurt/Main.  Despite the
protests of politicians, the current policy toward families is not
socially just.  Hidden poverty is a problem present in many families.
Caritas has therefore selected the slogan "Poor Families -- Poor
Society" as their theme for the year.

Construction on A20 motorway stopped
</H1>
The Federal Administrative Court has suspended construction of the
Baltic Sea motorway near Luebeck.  The judges in Berlin found the
State of Schleswig-Holstein may not have observed European Union
guidelines on environmental protection when approving the decision to
build.  The complaint of an enviromentalist group against the
construction of the A20 may therefore be successful.  Immediate
implementation of the decision to build has been prevented.  Several
sections of A20 in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania are already finished.

Hesse and Schleswig-Holstein: Halt to deportations of Algerians
</H1>
In reaction to the massacres in Algeria, the Ministers of the Interior
for Hesse and Schleswig-Holstein arranged a provisional halt to
deportations for refugees from the North African country.
Schleswig-Holstein Interior Minister Wienholz justified the decision
by noting the situation in Algeria was close to civil war.  Hesse also
will not return any Algerians to their homeland, at least until the
Conference of Ministers of the Interior on February 2nd.  This
excludes criminals.  Meanwhile, the European Union has called on
Algeria to provide concrete proposals for the containment of
terrorism.  A bomb explosion today in the capital city Algiers killed
at least two people, according to eyewitness reports.
