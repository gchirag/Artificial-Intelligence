Stoiber demands adherence to the Maastricht criteria
</H1>
Edmund Stoiber, the prime minister of Bavaria, has demanded the
strict adherence to the Maastricht criteria for monetary union; convergence
should determine the timetable, Mr. Stoiber said. Monetary union should
rather be delayed, instead of lessening the criteria for monetary union. He
said that a common currency for Europe meant a union "for better or worse",
and that it was a "marriage" which could not be dissolved.

Kohlhausen comments on the convergence criteria for monetary union
</H1>
The president of the Federal Association of German Banks, Mr.
Kohlhausen, has entered the discussion on the convergence criteria for
monetary union. He said to the Sunday newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeine
Sonntagszeitung" that it was acceptable if Germany had a net national debt
of 3.2 or 3.3. percent. The three percent limit set by Maastricht took this
into account, according to Mr. Kohlhausen. A lasting policy of stability
after the introduction of the Euro was much more important than the extent
of the new debt. He thus hoped that the Federal Minister of Finance, Theo
Waigel, be prepared to deviate from his current policy.

Endurance test for the governing coalition
</H1>
The argument over the reorganisation of the budget and tax increases
is leading to an ever increasing endurance test for the governing
coalition. Minister of Finance Waigel announced further drastic austerity
measures while referring to the 1998 budget. Mr. Waigel said that it was
essential to make extreme savings in all areas. He said that there should
be no taboo areas and he could not even rule out increasing national debt.
Even benefits  and subsidies would have to be re-examined. In the light of
the austerity measures undertaken by federal, state and communal
government, Mr. Waigel was confident that Germany would meet the criteria
for monetary union. The rumour, however, that the Federal Labour Office
alone would face cuts of over 2 billion marks this year caused furore in
opposition ranks. Rudolf Scharping,the Head of the SPD parliamentary
fraction, said that such measures would result in an additional 200 000
unemployed. The expert for social affairs for the Greens, Ms. Andrea
Fisher, said that this confirmed that the governing coalition was
absolutely desperate.
