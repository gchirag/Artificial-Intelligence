Baden-Wuerttemberg's SPD will elect new state party board
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg's Social Democratic Party (SPD) will hold
its elections for the state party board sooner than originally scheduled.
The state party board and district party leaders agreed on calling a
special state party conference to hold this election. This special state
party conference will also serve as a platform to compose a party reform
of Baden-Wuerttemberg's SPD. Ulrich Maurer, the current state party
leader, wants to continue to lead the party. There are no opposing
candidates so far.
However, many SPD officials call for his resignation. They view Mr. Maurer
as partly responsible for the SPD's lack of success in the last elections.
The special party conference is scheduled before summer break but there is
no official date known at this time.
