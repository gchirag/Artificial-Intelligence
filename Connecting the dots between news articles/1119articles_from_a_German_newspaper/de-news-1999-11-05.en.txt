Chancellor Schroeder: visit to China a success
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder said in Beijing that his 3-day visit to China had been
a success, both as far as business as well as politics were concerned. He
also said that Ms Vollmer, Deputy Speaker of Parliament
(Bundestagsvizepraesidentin), who had accompanied him, would look into
intensifying the dialogue about matters of law/civil rights, as agreed
previously. On Thursday, German chemical companies had signed agreements
covering 6 billion marks in investments. China also showed some interest
in the high-speed magnetic levitation train 'Transrapid'.

Experts: tax-take will rise by 10 billion marks in 1999/2000
</H1>
Governments' revenue will rise by some 10 billion marks during the next two
years, according to a working committee on tax-take that had been meeting at
Hanover for the last two days. Finance Minister Eichel, however, thought
that this windfall would not be enough to make up shortfalls caused by
*additional* tax-cuts. The experts revised their May estimates and
projected tax-take to be up by 6.8 billion marks in 1999 (plus 3 billion
marks in the year 2000).

More laws on ecological tax-reform passed
</H1>
Parliament's finance committee used the coalition's votes to pass the law
on continued ecological tax-reform. Step 2 will see petrol-tax rise four
times (every 3 months) by six Pfennigs (.06 marks) per litre, and tax on
electricity by .5 Pfennigs (.005 marks) per kilowatt-hour - as of 1 January
2000. The committee also decided to tax capital life insurance where
policies were taken out after 1 January 2000. Life insurance with regular
payments - similar to pensions - however, will remain tax-free.

According to the tabloid BILD, government is planning drastic cuts to
politicians' pensions. This was based on a draft by the SPD and the Greens

from their pay by parliament. So far only 50% is taken into account.

sounded positive: important decision had been made as far as recording and
monitoring of greenhouse-emissions were concerned.
