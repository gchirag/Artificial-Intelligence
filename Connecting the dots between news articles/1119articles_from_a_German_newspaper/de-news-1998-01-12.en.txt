cloning. In Paris, they signed an amendment to the Council's biomedical
convention to that effect. This is the first legally binding
international ban of such experiments. France, Italy and the 4
Scandinavian countries are among the signatories of the agreement.

Mercedes accused of bribery and attempted money laundering
</H1>
A Luxembourg bank has brought severe court charges against the former
Mercedes Benz AG corporation. The firm is accused of bribery and
attempted money laundering with regard to a 1993 planned Mercedes export
deal to Russia to the tune of US$ 870 million (about DM 1.4 billion).
According to internal Mercedes documents obtained by Sueddeutscher
Rundfunk radio, the funds had been illegally transferred to Switzerland
in the 1980s, by former Soviet bigwigs, including KGB officers. With a
Monaco businessman, well related to the Russians, acting as broker, the
money was to be transferred into Mercedes accounts via several areas of
business. A Mercedes document states that the transfers were to be
effected using Russian p.o. box businesses in order to avoid arousing
attention within the international financial community. Mercedes then
intended to ship 11,000 passenger cars to Russia. To get the action
going, Mercedes shelled out US$ 20 million to the broker. The bank calls
this "bribe money." The deal, however, fell through. Now Mercedes, the
broker, and his bank take turns at leveling charges against one another
generating a flood of court actions in several countries.

Henkel says he did not come out for breaking the law
</H1>
In the controversy about proposed changes to the collective
bargaining procedures, the chairman of the German Federation of
Industries (BDI), Henkel denies having called on employers to break the
law. He stated that by calling "exemplary" the action of thousands of
East German companies pulling out of collective wage agreements, he
really meant to say that this kind of action should be legalized.
Talking to the news agency "dpa", Henkel was positive that nobody within
the Federation of Industries wanted to do away with collective
bargaining, but rather a change towards greater flexibility should be
attained.

Task force to decide on telephone changeover fees
</H1>
Telekom and the private telephone companies are not coming to terms in
the matter of changeover fees. The representatives of the companies and
the government regulation board have agreed on setting up a task force
which has until the end of January to examine the future procedure of
changing over from one service provider to another; it will also
research who should cover the resulting costs. The controversy came up
in the first days of the year when Telekom wanted to charge DM 95 just
for a change of provider of long distance calls. The task force will
have to find an answer to the questions of whether the fees should be
paid by the new provider, or divvied up between the former and new
provider, or passed along wholly or partially to the consumer. The
chairman of the regulatory board, Scheuerle said that the goal of the
study would be to avoid burdening consumers with the switchover fees.

Stock markets and exchange rates
</H1>
The heavy losses incurred by East Asian financial markets have taken
their toll on the German and US stock markets.
By the end of floor trading, the German Index of Shares (DAX) had gone
down 3.5%, closing at just 4087 points. Dealers called today a "hectic
and tense" day. Not just in Frankfurt, but all over Europe stock
exchanges had to take noticeable losses. New York's Wall Street also
opened with significant losses.
The East Asian financial crisis has thereby led to a world-wide
financial shake-up. The prime reason for today's crisis originated in
Hongkong,, where the breakdown of Asia's largest investment company had
caused a drop of almost 9% at Hongkong's stock exchange.
