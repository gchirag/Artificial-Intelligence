Green Party wants to show colors in economic policy
</H1>
The Green Party wants to become more involved in economic policy and set
its own accents. Chairman of the Executive Board Trittin demanded today
during a strategy congress to concentrate on the three priorities of
ecological renewal of the economy, fair distribution of work and income,
and basic social security. In the parliamentary election of 1998, a shift
in economic policy will be at stake. Either Germany will become radically
free-market, or it will show solidarity. Party speaker Sager encouraged the
delegates to engage in a debate about the future. The Green Party has to
show that it is prepared for tough subjects and tough times.
Yesterday, State Premier of Saxony-Anhalt Hoeppner (SPD) argued for a
red-green alliance on the federal level. Hoeppner is the first social
democratic State Premier participating in such an event sponsored by the
Green Party.
