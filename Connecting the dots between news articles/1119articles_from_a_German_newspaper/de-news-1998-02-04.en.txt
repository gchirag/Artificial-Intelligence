Eight Germans amongst dead in cable car accident in Cavalese
</H1>
It is now known that a total of twenty people died in the cable car
accident in the Dolomite mountains in Italy, including eight German
citizens. The authorities in Cavalese have announced that all the
victims have now been identified. A military aeroplane from the
American contingent of the SFOR troop for Bosnia clipped the cable
yesterday and cut it clean through during a low-level flight over the
ski resort near Trient, causing a full cable car to fall 100 metres to
the ground. Following the accident NATO has cancelled all low-level
flights over Italy. President Clinton has offered his sympathy to the
families of the victims.

No improvement in unemployment rate
</H1>
The 'ap' news agency has reported that the German unemployment rate
reached 4.8 million in January, an increase of 300,000 over the rate
for December; the official figures are due to be announced tomorrow.
As usual, there is a great difference between the figures for the east
and the west of Germany - in the east, the rate has now exceeded the
20% mark by more than 1%, whereas the west German rate is 10.5%. There
is thus no sign of a change in the current employment trend: the
diagnosis is for "a high degree of stagnation." Only in the west has
there been a slight reduction in comparison with last year. In the
west, there were 13,000 less people without jobs than in January 1997;
in the east, there are 200,000 more than last year, largely due to the
crisis in the construction industry. These figures will doubtless
provoke some comment in Bonn, even if the psychologically important 5
million barrier has not yet been reached.

Unions reject employment support programme
</H1>
The government's initiative for a new employment support programme has
been rejected by the German Federation of Trade Unions. The
Federation's deputy president, Engelen-Kefer, told the ARD TV station
that any such programme which is not properly financed is sure to
fail, given the expected record high in unemployment. She said that it
is paradoxical that the local authorities are expected to provide
funds to increase employment when they are suffering funding problems.
In an interview with the broadcasting company 'Deutschlandfunk,'
Wiesehuegel, the president of the trade union Bau, Agrar, Umwelt
('Construction, agriculture, environment') said that the initiative
was an attempt to mislead people, and it would not help the situation.

Education committee approve outline of new university law
</H1>
The government used its majority on the Bundestag education committee
to approve the outline of a new university and higher education law.
The reform provides for a shortening in the time spent by students at
university and for the assessment of students and lecturers. The
opposition voted against the bill because it did not exclude the
possibility that students might be charged fees.

Audit Office criticises cost of new Berlin government buildings
</H1>
According to the 'Sueddeutsche Zeitung' newspaper, the Federal Audit
Office thinks that the cost of the new governmental and parliamentary
buildings in Berlin is far too high; this is the newspaper's
interpretation of the Office's first interim report for the
Bundestag's budget committee. The report criticises the fact that the
government is spending too much money on the new buildings and that
the whole move to Berlin is so generously provided for. The newspaper
reports that the Audit Office's greatest criticism is that the
Ministry of Building and Construction's financial projections are not
being respected. Especially the new parliamentary buildings and the
Chancellor's office are accused of being too luxurious.

Nestle blackmailer demands DM 800,000
</H1>
The state criminal police in Baden-Wuerttemberg announced this evening
that the firm Nestle has received a demand for DM 800,000 from an
unknown blackmailer who has been poisoning 'Alete' baby food in the
state. The demand arrived on 26th January with a package of poisoned
Nestle products at the firm's head office in Frankfurt. The
blackmailer has sent two further letters in which he claims to have
sent 40 poisoned packages to various addresses; the police has
intercepted all of these, apart from one, which they are searching for
in the area around Munich. Following a tip-off from the blackmailer,
the police discovered five jars of 'Alete' baby food which had been
poisoned with the agricultural chemical E605 in a chemist's shop in
Leibelsheim near Ludwigsburg.

Herzog criticises poor security for investors in Ukraine
</H1>
Roman Herzog, the federal president of Germany, has called on Ukraine
to improve security for investors in the country. Following talks with
the Ukrainian president Kuczmar (sp?) in Kiev, he said that it was not
good, for example, that tax incentives were simply abolished after
five years; he said that investors should not be scared away. As
regards Ukraine's ambition to join the EU, the president said that
there was no doubt that Ukraine was part of Europe, but that it would
take years before the country would be ready to join the EU.
