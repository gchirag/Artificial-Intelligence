Trial against German in Israel
</H1>
Tel Aviv. The trial against a German, who is accused of planing a
suicide attack on behalf of the terror group Hisbollah, has been opened
at an Israelite court today. The 26-year old man from Braunschweig is
accused of being part of a terrorist organisation, conspiracy in favour
of the enemy of the Israelite state, and deliberate compromise of
Israelite safety.
According to the police the man, who had converted to Islam, was
arrested four weeks ago at Ben-Gurion-Airport. Allegedly he had been
trained in the use of explosives and light weapons in Lebanon and was
supposed to find suitable targets for terrorist attacks. Afterwards he
should have met a contact person in Turkey to finalise preparations for
an attack.
The accused, who has a criminal record and a history of drug taking in
Germany, has pleaded guilty. But according to his lawyer this confession
was extorted by the police under duress. Hisbollah has denied any
connection to the man and accused the Israelite secret service of
inventing the whole story. The trial will continue on 4th January.

Berlin Liberals: Federal party without profile
</H1>
According to the head of the Berlin Liberals [FDP], Mr. Matz,
the parliamentary group of the party in Bonn has no profile and no
concept for the future. During an interview Mr. Matz said he feared the
worst for the federal elections in 1998, if the FDP in Bonn continues
along its way. According to him the Liberals have abandoned whole areas
of policy years ago and should redefine their profile especially in the
area of social policy.

Jagoda: Reforms already needed during 1998
</H1>
The president of the Federal Labour Office, Bernhard Jagoda,
demanded that decisions regarding reforms of his agency should be taken
before the general elections next autumn. During a newspaper interview
Mr. Jagoda asked the parties for a sensible compromise. If nothing was
being done until the elections, the effects of any reform  would be
visible by the end of 1999 at the earliest, and Germany could ill afford
that. The problem of mass unemployment would still not be taken
seriously enough.

Hildebrandt: Differences between East and West will remain
</H1>
According to the welfare minister of Brandenburg, Mrs.
Hildebrandt, the differences between East- and Western Germany are here
to stay. In an interview with the Deutsche Presseagentur [dpa] Mrs.
Hildebrandt, who belongs to the social democrats, criticised that East
German wages were not adjusted to the Western German level. She also
diagnosed a lack of solidarity exemplified during the discussions about
the risk equity payment of public health insurance companies. The
original plans had called for an equity plan as soon as East Germany
reached 90 % of the income earned in Western Germany. But since the
recovery process came to a standstill, there was no solution to this
problem.
