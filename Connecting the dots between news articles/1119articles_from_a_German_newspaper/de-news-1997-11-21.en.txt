CSU-Party Conference in Munich
</H1>
This afternoon the CSU kicked off their 61st Party Congress in Munich.
Today and tomorrow the party mainly wants to demonstrate that there is no
in-fighting, and they also want to define the manifest for next year.
Tomorrow they will vote for the executive, and they are looking forward
to a visit of Chancellor Kohl and head of the parliamentary group Schaeuble.
Head of the party Waigel's and Bavarian state premier Stoiber's speeches
were first.

<P>
Mr Stoiber was adamant the Euro has to be a stable currency, asking for the
Maastricht criteria (level of debt, and others) to be followed to the
letter. This flew in the face of a discussion paper published this summer by
Mr Schaeuble, which - in Mr Stoiber's view - had been too lenient.
Mr Stoiber also ripped into the opposition SPD as far as the debate on
reforming pensions and the tax-system was concerned. The main problem
Germany had at present was the way the SPD-governed states blocked
legislation in the Upper House (Bundesrat). Mr Stoiber also was for setting
compulsory social security contributions at state levels. And he wanted
solidarity of all delegates in 1998 (that's when federal and Bavarian
state elections will take place, almost at the same time).

EU for co-ordinated measures to fight unemployment
</H1>
The EU member-states will close ranks and fight mass unemployment in the
future, together. At their recent meeting in Luxembourg, they agreed on
rules that should mainly benefit unemployed young persons and people who
have been unemployed for a long time. The council's president originally had
proposed that 25% of all unemployed persons would have to get special
employment-enhancement treatment within 5 years. According to press
reports, Germany had succeeded in lowering this to 20%.

Health ministers back injection rooms for heroin-addicts
</H1>
At the conference of state health ministers, a majority was for setting up
injection rooms for heroin-addicts. Saarland's minister Wackernagel-Jacobs
said that the drug problem could not be fought primarily by prosecution;
there rather should be trials where heroin-addicts received the drug under
medical supervision. Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate
voted against.

<P>
The ministers also agreed on subsidising the hard-up East German public
health insurers to the tune of 1.2 billion marks. This was supposed to
spread risks and level the burden step by step.

<P>
They also asked federal government to do more about cutting down on the
consumption of alcohol. Unanimously they voted for a remit to lower the
amount of alcohol available and the publicity for it, by law. And they also
wanted a 0 per thousand blood-alcohol level threshold for novice-drivers,
plus more preventative and other measures covering alcohol-addiction.

More cardiac specialists taken to court
</H1>
Public health scheme insurers took more cardiac specialists to court.
They were accused of having driven up prices. Now 12 out of 100 cardiac
surgeries in Germany are under investigation by public prosecutors. And more
are to follow, according to the insurers, as they claim that only 1 out
of 5 surgeries do not cook the books. Damages are close to 50 million marks,
and that would hit the insured as premiums had to go up to pay for
appliances being billed at up to 3 times their price, not passing on
discounts and billing stationary operations as out-of-hospital ones.
Overbilling would hurt colleagues as well. So far no-one has been sentenced,
and the same goes for the hospital-doctors involved in some 2000 lawsuits.
The insurers, however, said that in Lower Saxony the court had granted an
order of attachment. They agree that their auditing had not always been
the best in the past.

Train accident caused by excessive speed
</H1>
According to preliminary investigations, excessive speed was to blame for
the railway accident at Elsterwerda station. A Railways spokesperson,
Mr Wille, stated in Bonn that the driver of the petrol tanker-train had been
at least 20 km/hour above the speed-limit for this section. So far it was
unclear if human error or technical defects were to blame. Yesterday a
firefighter was killed in action, plus nine more persons were injured, some
severely.
