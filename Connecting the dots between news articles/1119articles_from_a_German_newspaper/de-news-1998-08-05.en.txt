Berlin: Search for victims of collapsed building continues
</H1>
Four persons are still assumed to be trapped under the rubble of the
collapsed building in Berlin.  The bodies of two women and a 13 year
old boy who was home alone at the time of the accident have been
recovered so far.  The leaders of the rescue operation feel there is a
definite possibility that people could have survived inside pockets in
the rubble.  So far however, despite the use of bloodhounds no new
signs of life have been located.  The work is extremely difficult, as
multi-ton chunks of rubble constantly threaten to shift or slide.  On
top of that, the rescuers have no information on where in the building
people were at the time of the accident.  The collapse was caused by a
gas explosion.

In late afternoon, a further body was found.  According to the Fire
Chief's report, it was a 70 year old occupant of the building.  This
raises the total number of victims to four.  Police, Fire, and
technical aid organizations have 600 aid workers on the scene, who are
clearing away the collapsed building stone by stone.  The recovery
work may last through till tomorrow.

Seehofer calls for unified national drug policy
</H1>
The Minister of Health has criticized the fact that there are great
differences in the drug policies of the different federal states.  The
CDU politician accused SPD governed states of sabotaging the successes
of the federal government in the area of drug policy, reducing those
successes to nothing.  Cities such as Hamburg and Frankfurt have
offended by setting up "safe rooms" where addicts can take their
drugs, which is clearly against the narcotics laws.  Because of this,
argues Seehofer, the Minister of Justice needs to ensure that criminal
prosecutions in Germany are standardized.

Seehofer calls for stricter control of methadone
</H1>
The Ministry of Health is apparently considering improved controls
over so-called "substitution programs" for drug addicts.  Only
specially trained doctors would be permitted to prescribe methadone
for example.  Additionally, methadone programs would be required
provide qualified psychiatric and psychosocial care.  An investigation
of around 2,200 prescriptions from such programs in Munich and the
surrounding region turned up numerous irregularities, said Seehofer.

Trades and crafts can create more jobs
</H1>
Owing to growth in sales, the German trade and craft industries can
create approximately 50,000 jobs this year.  President of the Central
Association, Phillip, said the mild economic recovery in Germany must
not be allowed to cover up the fact that the industry urgently needs
relief in the form of tax reform and a restructuring of the social
support system.  The economic crisis in eastern Germany, however, has
meant that this year fewer apprentices can be taken on.

Gas eruption in Kirchseon
</H1>

vicinity of Kirchseon had to be closed this afternoon.  According to
police reports from Erding, the operator of some excavating machinery
damaged a high pressure gas line.  The gas blasted stones and chunks
of earth into the air, damaging several autos as well as the roofs of
two buildings.  No persons were injured and the line has been

Labor market forecast
</H1>
Experts estimate the number of unemployed has continued to rise in
July, up by approximately 80,000 to 4,150,000.  Reasons for the rise
include company holidays and the last opportunities for giving notice
before the end of the quarter, as well as the end of the instructional
year.  The IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich also issued a
forecast for the labor market today.  According to their report,
unemployment is unlikely to sink below 4 million.  The Institute says
a turning point has been reached in the western states, but not
however in the east.  As for economic growth, the researchers expect
an increase of 2.7% for 1998.

Renewed Search
</H1>
At Lassing in Austria, technicians have begun dig using the so-called
"Hammer Drilling" method.  Via this fast but inexact process, they
want to reach two pockets in the collapsed mine.  However the leaders
of the operation have already said yesterday that the ten buried
miners no longer have any chance of survival.
