Police have hot trace of Christina's murderer
</H1>
Police seem to make good progress in finding the murderer of 11-year-old
Christina Nytsch of Struecklingen, Lower Saxony. They succeeded in
establishing the murderer's genetic finger print and now check with persons
who were linked to sexual offenses earlier. The girl had been found dead
last weekend in Lower Saxony. The murderer had abused her first and then
choked her.
A police spokesperson said the search for evidence and traces of the
murderer was promising but it was still too early to call it a hot trace.
Currently about 250 police officers and soldiers search the 20 square
kilometers around the location where the girl was found for evidence.
Police are also hopeful to find new evidence in the case of Ulrike Ewert.
The then 13-year-old girl had disappeared in 1996. She lived only 25 km
from Christina's home town Strueckligen.

Extortionist demands stop of CASTOR transports
</H1>
German Railways is being extorted by an unknown since Saturday. The
extortionist supported his demands by hiding a fake bomb on the Cologne
railway station. Police confirmed the extortion but denied any information
by demand of the Prosecution and for strategic reasons. Police also want to
prevent imitators. The Cologne-based tabloid Express reported today that
someone calling himself Michael demands a stop of the CASTOR (nuclear
waste) transports and 1.5 million marks. In a letter to the Express he

station. In a phone call to Express he is reported to have said "This is
the revenge for CASTOR" and threatened to fill the empty bomb with gun
powder and explode it without warning if his demands were not met by March

perpetrator or perpetrators. Meanwhile, German Railways announced to

Audi reports results for 1997
</H1>
The car companies report dream-like results. Following Daimler-Benz and
BMW, Audi reported their results for 1997 this morning. They spelled big
money.
For the first time in the company's history more than half a million
vehicles have been sold. The returns increased by 19 percent to more than
22 billion marks and the profit reached record heights, increasing by 29
percent to 1.1 billion marks before taxes. The workers will also profit
from this splendid result. Franz-Josef Paefgen, CEO, said "Audi, as a
group, now has 38420 employees, as on December 31, 1997. That is an
increase of 9.1 percent compared to the year before. That is, we have
increased the work force by 5000 during the last three years, 3000 alone in
Germany. Of course, this rate won't continue, but we are confident that we
will keep adding rather than diminishing." The Audi president also
announced that the company will invest about 11 billion marks within the
next five years. That is another record.

Self-criticism of Green party
</H1>
The budget expert of Buendnis90/Die Gruenen Metzler expects another defeat
for his party in the state elections in Saxony-Anhalt after the
disappointing results in Lower-Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. He said
anything else would be a wonder after the debates about higher gas and
kerosene prices. The party's economics expert Beck said the issue was an
obvious public-relations mistake. The party had put the demand of 5 marks
per litre (c. US$11/gallon) into a four-year party platform although the
demand was made for a ten-year project. Party leader of the Bundestag
faction Joschka Fischer also urged for a better party presentation.

SPD vs. Stoiber
</H1>
The Bavarian Social-Democrats have criticized the latest education
initiative by the state government. SPD leader Renate Schmidt said the
initiative was a soother for upset parents and teachers. Earlier, the
government had decided to employ 2000 additional young teachers until the
year 2002. The teachers will get a 2/3 time employment contract for two
years and then a full contract as government employees. At the same time,
the Bavarian government enables a work time account for teachers over 53.
That means teachers can work 1 more hour per week for three years and then
get off 1 hour per week for the next three years. The programme is to match
the increasing numbers of pupils. Up to 70,000 additional students are
expected to fill the class rooms until 2002. At the same time the classes
are to be reduced from 33 to 32 at all basic schools (Hauptschulen). The
number of lessons at primary schools (grade 1-6) will be increased
gradually by three. In addition, all primary schools will ensure the care
of the pupils from 7:30 to 13:00 to relieve working parents.

1.8 million hours over-time in Germany
</H1>
German employees worked 59 hours over-time per person last year. The hours
were similar in east and west Germany according to the Federal Department
of Labour. The president of the Institute for Employment Market and
Profession Research Mr. Kleinhens pointed out that the over-time could be
reduced by 40 percent by using borrowed workers and short-term employments.
Basically, however, over-time was necessary for the flexibility of
companies.
