SPD and Greens: fight against unemployment has absolute priority
</H1>
Social Democrats and Greens plan to give the fight against
unemployment absolute priority in their joint government. Future
Chancellor Schroeder and Green parliamentary leader Fischer emphasized
that intention, following the second round of their coalition
negotiations in Bonn. They agreed that one central task would be to
establish an 'Alliance for Employment and Education' in cooperation
with other concerned organizations. Neither party wants to implement
fees for higher education. SPD and Greens also agreed to look at
'ecological tax reform'. Details such as the eventual price of
gasoline are to be discussed tomorrow.

Future state coalition in Schwerin still uncertain
</H1>
The SPD and CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania have ended their
exploratory discussions on forming a joint government. The future
state premier, Ringsdorff (SPD) said there was no need for a further
round of talks. He left open whether a new 'grand coalition' between
SPD and CDU was possible. Ringsdorff and the leader of the state CDU,
Merkel, agreed that their two parties had moved closer together on how
to represent the state in the Bundesrat (senate). The CDU says it
wants to contribute to the arrangements for a nation-wide "Alliance
for Employment" ("Buendnis fuer Arbeit") from within the Bundesrat.
Ringsdorff also announced the second round of exploratory talks with
the PDS tomorrow.

SPD wants to honour its election promises
</H1>
The SPD wants to honour the promises it made during the recent
election campaign, despite the budgetary gap it has apparently just
discovered. SPD parliamentary group leader Scharping explained that
the pension reforms passed by the departing government would be
revoked. The party's financial expert, Matthaeus-Maier said that the
increase in family allowance to 250 DM, and the 2500 DM tax relief
promised to two-child families would certainly become reality. Dieter
Hundt, the president of the German Employers' Association, renewed his
warning to the future government that they should not rescind the last
govenrment's reforms in the ares of pensions, paid sick leave and
protection against unlawful dismissal. He said that he thought a
compromise could be reached on the question of the "Alliance for
Employment", however.

SPD's Dressler: serious problems with civil service pensions
</H1>
The new federal government will quickly have to address the issue of
reforming the civil service pensions system. "The financial
shortcomings in the present civil service pension system are far more
serious than those in old-age pensions," Dressler told the "Leipziger
Volkszeitung" newspaper. The adjustment of civil service pensions to
'normal' pension levels - ie. downwards - is without a doubt the only
realistic option, he said. The chairman of the National Union of Civil
Servants, Geyer, has sharply criticized Dressler, telling the radio
station "berlin aktuell" that the politician was initiating a campaign
of jealousy.

0.8% inflation rate - lowest in East since Reunification
</H1>
Again in September, prices in Germany increased hardly at all. Goods
and services cost only 0.8 percent more this September than at the
same time last year; compared to August, prices are even down by 0.2
percent. The primary reason for the low rate was cheaper seasonal
foodstuffs - fruit and vegetables. In Western Germany, the annual
inflation rate as of last month was 0.7 percent; in the East, 0.8
percent. For the former East German territory, this is the lowest rate
since reunification.
