No agreement on pension reform in sight
</H1>
One day before the second talk on pension reforms between the
governing coaition and the SPD, an agreement is not likely. The SPD's expert
on social issues, Dressler, said his party would only participate in the
talk as a token of good will. According to Dressler, there would only be
formal negotations with the government parties if they give up plans to
lower the old-age pension level from currently 70 to 64 percent. The SPD
introduced its own pension plan, which includes a release of the pension
insurance from unrelated payments and the extension of the group of
contributors. The SPD design would include mandatory contributions from parttime workers, the self-employed and the so-called seemingly self-employed.
The head of the FDP, Gerhardt, rejected this demand. Theo Waigel, finance
minister and head of the CSU, called the SPD's position incomprehensible and
asked the Social Democrats to compromise. He called the party's plan
unsuitable and accused the SPD of using pensions as an election campaign
topic. Waigel also said that basically he considered positive the
willingness to compromise shown by individual SPD politicians over the past
few days. Labor minister Bluem announced that he would fight for a
compromise.

SPD demands reform of citizenship laws
</H1>
The Social Democrats intend to employ a parliamentary motion to force
the governing coalition to introduce a bill on the reform of the nationality
law by the end of the parliamentary term. The deputy chairman of the SPD
parliamentary group, Schily, said that the government remained disgracefully
indecisive and unable to act in this matter. He said that this inactiveness
endangered internal peace because it prevented the integration of many
aliens born in Germany. According to Schily, their naturalization should be
facilitated and dual citizenship be accepted to a moderate extent. At the
same time, the SPD demands a law to regulate immigration into Germany.

Seehofer praises success of AIDS prevention
</H1>
Ten years after the introduction of the first prevention campaign,
the federal minister of health, Seehofer, emphasized the successes in the
fight against AIDS. Seehofer said that the apocalyptic scenarios had not
become reality and that the federal government would continue to emphasize
prevention because there still are no vaccines and true remedies. According
to Seehofer, the campaign's results are positive. As late as the mideighties, estimates had put possible HIV infections in Germany at one
million. In reality, 50,000 to 60,000 people have been infected since the
outbreak of the epidemic. By the end of 1996, about 19,000 of those infected
with HIV had developed AIDS and 14,000 had died. The annual infection rate
is about 2,000. Seehofer called these numbers a success, saying that Germany
ranked at the top in AIDS prevention worldwide.
