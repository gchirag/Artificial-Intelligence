Serious fire in Rheine
</H1>
In what may prove to be a case of arson, a fire in a
commercial/residential building in this city in the Muensterland area
killed 7 people, 4 of them children. Additionally, two occupants were
seriously injured. The dead are thought to have been a Russian-German
family.
Police today took an Albanian man into custody. He had come forward as the
person who first gave the alarm, but under examination got caught making
inconsistent statements. The man is thought to have had a relationship
with one of the victims, a young woman, until they broke it off just
recently. The police are not saying that this matter had anything to do
with the cause of the fire. Speculations of a possible family tragedy were
in circulation throughout the day, but police refused to comment on the
rumours, and did point out that the man in custody may have given
contradictory information due to linguistic difficulties.
The investigation continues on all fronts.

Trial against miracle healer Hamer begins
</H1>
So-called cancer-healer Gerd Hamer (sp?) appearing before the
Regional Court in Cologne, denied charges that he was at least partly
responsible for the deaths of at least 3 patients. He also used the first
day of hearings to make a serious indictment of orthodox medicine. The
62-year-old former doctor stands accused of denying necessary assistance
as well as 13 offences against the Non-medical Practitioners' Law. Hamer
is thought to have illegally treated dying and dead cancer patients,
despite having had his medical license revoked in 1986. Still in custody,
due to fears that he could flee the country, Hamer denies the Public
Prosecution's charges. His defence counsel stated weeks ago that Hamer
merely advised patients at seminars, but did not treat them. Three days of
hearings have been provisionally planned for - in the largest court
chamber in Cologne, due to the great interest expected in the case.

Compensation for Eastern European Jews remains unsettled
</H1>
Holocaust victims from the Czech Republic and the United States
want to sue the Federal Republic of Germany if no settlement is
forthcoming in the matter of compensation for survivors from Eastern
Europe. The announcement came from the lawyer in the negotiations between
the German government and the Jewish Claim Conference. The Munich legal
office is representing thousands of claimants against 16 European
insurance companies and Swiss banks in this suit of Holocaust victims.
Pay-outs by the German government have heretofore been overwhelmingly in
Western countries, where those affected can receive individual pensions.
In Eastern Europe, on the other hand, lump sums have been made to federal
governments, where the money often dried up before reaching victims.
A monthly pension of about DM 200 is currently on the table.

ethics course in school may be mandatory or not. The background to the
case is the suit of a non-religious pupil against a course in values and

courses were not mandatory, then the alternative could not be either.

on Bavarian radio. A spokesman for Waigel said that he was available for
another term in office, if voters gave him the mandate. A spokesman for

Reforms to post-secondary education still controversial
</H1>
Various associations and parties have given the university reforms
recently agreed upon by federal and state negotiators marks ranging from
good to unsatisfactory. The Conference of University Rectors, the highest
administrative organ of the universities , welcomed the plan, but called
for more money at the same time. The National Union of Employees and the
Green Party criticized the abolishment of many democratic elements in the
university constitution. Federal and state representatives had reached a
basic agreement on shortening study programs, which, given current
conditions, is also a problem of money. Many post-secondary institutions
are too short on funds and personnel to be able to offer every student
sufficient education opportunities.

Pile-up on Autobahn A7
</H1>
There was a pile-up on the Wuerzburg-Fulda autobahn this morning. Several
people were trapped in their vehicles. Early reports indicate that a
transport truck lost control in heavy rain and hit the meridian, bounced
off, and presumably came to rest in a driving lane. Seven further vehicles
ran into the truck, most likely as a result of following too closely for
safety given the wet conditions. At least 8 people were injured in the
accident, some seriously. One victim had to be taken to hospital by
helicopter. Damages are estimated at over DM 100,000.
