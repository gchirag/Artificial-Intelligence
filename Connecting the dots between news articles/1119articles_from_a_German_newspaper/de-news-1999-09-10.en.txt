Brandenburg's SPD likely to form coalition with CDU
</H1>
Predictions are that Brandenburg's SPD will start negotiating with the CDU
about forming a coalition with them. That's according to State Premier
Stolpe, who said that a commission had recommended this to the party. The
CDU would be more inclined to back a policy of social justice, that at the
same time would guarantee economic stability. He also emphasised that the
partnership between SPD and CDU would not be a marriage made in heaven.
Social Affairs Minister Hildebrandt stated that she would not serve under a
Big Coalition government. Ms Hildebrandt repeatedly had spoken out in favour
of co-operation with the PDS party. The commission is to decide as early as
tonight. The SPD had lost its absolute majority at last Sunday's state
elections, and therefore will now have to rely on a coalition partner.

Before state elections: head of the party's membership cancelled
</H1>
Two days before the state elections in Thueringen, the FDP-party executive
asked for the membership of its president, Mr Arendt, to be cancelled.
While this was being processed, Mr Arendt would stay suspended, deputy
Moeller said at a meeting under urgency in Erfurt. The federal head of the
party Gerhardt backed the decision. A special congress will elect a new
president, though no date has been set so far. Thuringia's head of the
FDP-party had appealed to the electorate to vote for the CDU at last
Sundays's elections, as the chances of his party were small.

FDP infighting: Mr Kubicki suggest Mr Gerhardt step down
</H1>
Schleswig-Holstein's head of the FDP parliamentary group Kubicki suggested
that head of the FDP Gerhardt step down. In the wake of the poor results at
recent state elections, the federal head of the party should ask himself if
it really made sense to cling to certain views, according to an interview
with SPIEGEL Online. At the same time he asked deputy leader Bruederle to
show more flag than in the past.

Chancellor Schroeder commemorates Hungary's opening of border
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder thanked Hungary for opening up their border to the
(free) western countries. He said that this had been an act of courage,
with historical consequences, when speaking at a special session of
parliament in Budapest. At the time this had enabled thousands of citizens
of the then German Democratic Republic (GDR) to enter western countries.
Austria's Chancellor Klima said Hungary's decision - which then had still
been a communist country - had been a harbinger of the democratic revolution
in all of Eastern Europe.

Surprise at Mr Klimmt's nomination
</H1>
The SPD parliamentary group was surprised outgoing State Premier Klimmt, of
Saarland, was appointed Federal Minister of Transport, according to an
interview on radio Deutschlandfunk with head of the SPD parliamentary group
Mueller. Quite a few would have had trouble making any sense of the
decision. He would welcome Mr Klimmt's appointment; at the end of the day,
diverging directions within the party should converge.

Greece, Nicosia in Cyprus, Vancouver in Canada, Houston, Seattle, Ann Arbor
in the US as well as San Jose in Costa Rica would get the chop. Parts of
Cordoba in Argentinia and Bandung in Indonesia would be closed, too.

BRK admits to truth of some of the graft allegations
</H1>
The Bavarian Red Cross (BRK) admitted that they had cheated in the past as
far as wages had been concerned. Managing director Fischer said that
unfilled vacancies had been booked as filled and claimed for. Last year, 118
positions out of a total of 1526 had been duds. Some 4000 residents of BRK-
resthomes had been hurt by the scheme. In 1993, when there had been 11 duds,
residents had overpaid to the tune of 715,000 marks. For weeks the BRK had
been at the centre of allegations of graft. Recently, the Munich public
prosecutor took two former managers to court. They allegedly had taken
backhanders from companies manufacturing medical products for years - up
to 4.4 million marks.

Head of the Trade Unions: employers welshed on apprenticeship promises
</H1>
The German Trade Union Council (DGB) accused the employers to have welshed
on their promises on apprenticeships, pledges they had made for the
so-called Treaty for Work. In July the employers had stated that they would
create 18,000 new apprenticeships, whereas the 22,000 new apprenticeships
that had eventuated this year would have been the result of the federal
government's ad-hoc program, according to union executive Goerner. Latest
results, however, even suggested that their number had dropped by 6,500.
170,000 young people did not have an apprenticeship, with 92,000 of them
'on hold', for example in schools or jobs.
