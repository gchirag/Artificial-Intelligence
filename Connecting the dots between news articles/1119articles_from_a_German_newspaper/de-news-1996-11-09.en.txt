by the thousands in 1989, and thus brought about the opening of the
border.

activists to the fall of the wall seven years ago. Kohl stressed that it

women who had made possible the peaceful revolution in the German East.

freedom against its enemies.

Bubis Calls to Remember Victims Without Guilt
</H1>
The chair of the central committee of Jews in Germany, Bubis, has called
the German population to keep alive memories of the holocaust. If the
victims were not remembered then they would die a second death, Bubis said
at an event in Frankfurt/Main commemorating the anniversary of the Crystal
night. He noted that remembrance was not to be equated with feelings of
guilt among the younger generations of Germans, and he added that the only
reason why anyone should feel guilt today was if they had not learnt their
lesson from the past. 

<P>
Commemoration events for the victims of the Crystal
night on November 9, 1938 were also held in all other German states.
During that night, Nazis all over Germany burnt down about 2,000
synagogues and broke the windows of many Jewish shops.

Export of Illegal Waste to Hong Kong
</H1>
The news magazine "Der Spiegel" has published a report of a new
transport of illegal waste abroad. According to the magazine, fifty
containers filled with highly polluted plastic waste have been stored in
the harbor of the British crown colony of Hong Kong for months. The waste
had originally been destined for the recycling effort "Duales System," but
had been shipped from Rotterdam to Asia without the knowledge of the main
executives of "Duales System Germany." Hong Kong has now asked the German
government to have the waste shipped back to Germany.
<P>
North Rhine-Westphalia's minister for the environment, Baerbel Hohn
commented that this case worsened her previously held doubts concerning
the feasibility of the "Duales System" recycling concept. She noted that
more and more, the "Duales System" waste was not recycled or destroyed,
but rather was being sold off and transported to foreign countries.

Further Increases in Health Insurance Premiums
</H1>
German citizens will have to be prepared for increases in public health
insurance premiums again this coming year. Minister of Health Seehofer
said in an interview with the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" that the number
of elderly sick people was rising continuously, the treatment of
whom was going to require more and more funds in the future. In the long
run, services would have to be cut and premiums raised, Seehofer said. All
health insurance companies are required by law to lower their premiums by
0.4 per cent by January 1, 1997. Several private insurance companies are
planning to circumvent this problem by raising their premiums by the same
amount for the month of December.
