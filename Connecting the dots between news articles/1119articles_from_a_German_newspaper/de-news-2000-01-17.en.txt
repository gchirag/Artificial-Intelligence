SPD demands new elections in Hessen
</H1>
When the financial scandal of the CDU in Hessen became known, the SPD-opposition
demanded new elections. The party executive committee of the SPD met at noon in
Wiesbaden to decide on a request of distrust. The SPD-leader in Hessen and
Federal Finance Minister, Eichel, said that the cabinet of Mr. Koch had lost its
right to govern the country. He demanded new elections, because the election
campaign last spring had been financed from unclear sources. But observers do
not expect an early end of the era "Koch", because the red-green opposition has
a lack of two seats in the Parliament. But the whole CDU is in a very bad mood
and the scandal still has not been cleared up. If Koch had known from the
financial scandal in his party, it is not very likely that he will keep his job.

CDU has been hit right in its position as a member of the constitutional state.

party exclusion has to be discussed. The state premier and leader of the CDU in
Hessen, Koch, can not exclude a connection between extra-accounts of the long
standing CDU-chairman, Kohl, and the millions of the regional CDU-group hidden

concerning the moneys of the CDU in Hessen.

No advantages of Raps oil compared with normal diesel oil
</H1>
According to the Federal Department for the Environment, diesel extracted from
Raps oil has no decisive advantage compared with normal diesel. If all
cultivation areas are used for planting Raps, diesel from Raps oil would cover
only half a percent of the whole demand. The money used for the subsidies could
better be spent for more effective ways to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide,
which does a lot of damage to the environment. Furthermore the Federal
Department for the Environment pointed out that the processing of Raps to diesel
oil consumes energy.
