Kohl willing to risk failure of tax summit
</H1>
Two days before the scheduled tax summit of the government coalition
and the Social Democratic oppositione in Bonn, Chancellor Kohl set
several stipulations. In a letter to the head of the SPD, Oskar
Lafontaine, Kohl demanded consent to the lowering of all tax rates
and to the pension reform. He emphasized that he deemed a further
dialogue feasible only if a fundamental willingness for compromise
was apparent.

<P>
Lafontaine again criticized the coalition's proposals, saying that
the chancellor's letter showed more than clearly who was responsible
for blocking movement. Lafontaine repeated his demand for a solution
in steps, suggesting that Social Democrats and the governement should
initially agree on a decrease in social security contributions
because this would be the most effective facilitation of job
creation.

<P>
The coalition has already stated that it plans to introduce its own
tax reform bill in the Bundestag this week in case Wednesday's tax
summit fails.

Tietmeyer warns against hasty implementation of currency union
</H1>
The president of the Bundesbank, Tietmeyer, supports a narrow
interpretation of the stability criteria for the implementation of a
common European currency. At an economics conference of the
organization of people's and savings banks in Guetersloh, Tietmeyer
said it would be dangerous to stick to the schedule with the help of
manipulations. The monetary union was designed for permanence and
therefore needed a solid foundation.

<P>
The European employers' association warned against postponing the
introduction of the joint currency. In its spring report, the
association again stated its opinion that the introduction of the
Euro would strengthen Europe's competitiveness, trigger growth, and
create jobs.
