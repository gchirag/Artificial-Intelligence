creating a non-military intervention force for missions in crisis

Lafontaine rejects employers' criticism
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Lafontaine has defended the launching of the
red-green government and has rejected criticism from the employer camp
on the proposed tax reform.  According to Lafontaine, the majority of
citizens are satisfied with the new government. The term "social
justice" has returned to the agenda in Germany.  Thanks to the governing
coalition's resolutions, the tax burden on workers and families will be
reduced by 12 billion marks. Lafontaine conceded, however, that large
corporations will face a tax increase amounting to about 10 billion
marks. However, this is an intentional policy.  Currently, corporations
pay the lowest taxes while employees pay the most.  According to
Lafontaine, the tax reform is intended to correct this imbalance.

Trade association president: training positions for youths
</H1>
President of the German Trade Association Philipp (sp?) said that all
young apprentices entering the labor force and willing to accept a
training position should be able to obtain one.  Mr. Philipp wrote in
"Bild am Sonntag" that is was unnecessary to threaten companies that are
not training apprentices with penalties.  This year, again, industry has
supplied a sufficient number of trainee positions without being coerced
by law.  More than 200,000 apprentice positions have been filled, and
that despite less than favorable economic trends.  Businesses, however,
expect a higher-quality school education and more flexibility from
young people.

Clement: Nuclear power phase-out complete in 35-40 years
</H1>
According to Minister President Clement of North Rhine-Westphalia, the
phase-out of  nuclear power pursued by the red-green federal government
could be complete only in 35-40 years. Mr. Clement (SPD) told "Bild am
Sonntag" that for the negotiations with the nuclear power industry, one
would have to take the average operative lifetime of the power plants
into account, which is not less than 35 years.  Clement emphasized that
those who believe to be able to cut this period by legislation will end
up sadly disappointed.  This would only make the process more
complicated and expensive without accelerating it.  The SPD has been
discussing a 20-year period until the shut-down of the last reactor.
Spokesperson of the Green's Executive Board, Ms. Roestel, boisterously
supported Environmental Minister Trittin. In an interview with "Welt am
Sonntag," that was circulated early, Ms. Roestel underscored that the
coalition contract contains an explicit scenario for the phase-out of
nuclear power which must now be implemented item-by-item.
