CDU and CSU are near to an agreement on eco-tax
</H1>
The CSU has welcomed Chancellor Kohl's latest pronouncement on the
subject of an energy tax. Prozner, the General Secretary of the CSU
said in an interview with the newspaper 'Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung'
that the European-wide harmonisation which Kohl had called for meant,
as far as the CSU was concerned, that there would be no automatic
increase in energy prices - quite the opposite: the other European
states would have to increase their taxes to the high level current in
Germany, in order to ensure fair competition. Given this rapprochement
between the sister parties, Prozner thinks it likely that the CDU and
the CSU will produce a common election manifesto. Kohl had said in an
interview with the newspaper 'Bild' that he supported the proposal in
the draft CDU manifesto to seek European agreement on an energy tax.
He said that there was no question of the CDU agreeing to a unilateral
German 'eco-tax'.

the current trend in the labour market; but this optimistic prognosis
only applies to the western part of the country, where the economists

OECD expects unemployment to remain high in Germany
</H1>
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (the
'OECD') has said that it does not expect a rapid drop in unemployment
in Germany. The OECD announced in Paris that, despite the favourable
economic situation and companies' good competitive ability, it expects
the unemployment rate to reduce from the current 12.1% only to 11.1%
next year. The Organisation claims that even more flexibility in terms
of pay and hours is needed to help improve the employment situation.
In its economic report, the OECD has predicted economic growth of 2.5%
to 3% for Germany; it has also warned that both pensions and the tax
system must be reformed in order to encourage long term growth.

Computer data still not secure at Thuringia's Interior Ministry
</H1>
There is discord again in Thuringia's 'grand coalition' government (a
coalition of CDU and SPD). The CDU state deputy Hans-Peter Hilfner has
said that it is scandalous that security is still not assured, even
after the recent theft of data (some data stored on computers was
stolen last November from the Ministry of the Interior). Yesterday,
Hilfner had himself managed to walk into an area of the Ministry where
sensitive information is kept. Debes (SPD), the Minister of the
Interior, said that he felt that such actions were putting the
coalition at risk and that some of the CDU parliamentary party seem to
have made a sport out of trying to get around his Ministry's security.

New investigations against 4 youths in asylum-home arson case
</H1>
The Luebeck Public Prosecutor's Office is investigating four young men
in the case of the arson attack on a home for asylum seekers in
January 1996. A spokesperson for the Office said that one of the four,
who is currently in jail, had made a confession six weeks ago, but had
retracted it a few days later. The Public Prosecutor does not believe
that the 20-year-old's confession is believable; it does not fit with
the circumstances of the attack, but is nonetheless being checked
carefully. Ten people died in the attack, which occurred well over two
years ago, and more than 35 people were in injured.
