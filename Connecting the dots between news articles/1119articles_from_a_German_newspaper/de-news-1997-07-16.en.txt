Flooding reaches Brandenburg
</H1>
Brandenburg is getting ready for the worst flooding in 70 years.
The water level of the Oder River is expected to crest by the weekend.
According to the boss at the environment bureau of the state of
Brandenburg, Matthias Freude, it will be much worse than expected. Experts
at the bureau now anticipate that the river will rise to over 6 metres.
Dikes along the Oder will then be near inundation, with no more than 1
metre of leeway. The polders in the state have already been flooded. 3000
hectares of the Lower Oder Valley National Park are already under water,
and another 2000 hectares may yet come to be. The height of the incoming
flood water can only be estimated at the present time. Reliable reports
are no longer available out of Poland, where the water level gauges have
been swept away by the flood. The city of Frankfurt (an der Oder - not
Frankfurt am Main) is particularly threatened by the flooding. Evacuation
plans for Frankfurt and the surrounding area have been worked out, and
there are a million sandbags standing by.

Federal cabinet agrees on changes to law on nuclear power plants
</H1>
The federal cabinet has decided on controversial changes to the law
governing nuclear power plants in Germany. In the future, plants will, for
the first time, be able to be built without the approval of the state
affected. The new bill provides for a permit procedure entirely under
federal control, regardless of the location. The expropriation of land to
build a plant upon will also be made easier. This latter clause arises
after the case of a property owner in Gorleben, in Lower Saxony, who has
so far successfully refused to give up his land, making use of the Mining
Law against exploration of the alpenstock.
The state of Saxony -Anhalt plans to challenge the changes, which also
allow for the operation of the Morsleben nuclear waste dump for 5 years
longer than originally expected.
The SPD, the Greens, and the PDS reject the planned changes, and feel that
the bill should also have to pass through the Bundesrat. Federal
Environment Minister Merkel does not see any need for a vote by the state
representatives in that body.

Schroeder for red-green coalition
</H1>
Premier of Lower Saxony, Schroeder, is in favour of a red-green
coalition, if the federal election in the fall of 1998 results in a
combined majority of SPD and Greens. Talking to 'Stern' magazine,
Schroeder also called for a timely declaration on the part of the federal
SPD of a red-green coalition in Bonn to their goal in the election. He
said it was a question of credibility: "The citizens of Germany won't buy
it if we waffle and say we'll decide after the election".

1998.

Last suspect in tunnel bank robbery in custody
</H1>
2 years after the hostage-taking in a Berlin bank, the last
suspect has been arrested in Lebanon. The robbers escaped at that time,
with the loot, through a tunnel they had dug. 7 of them have already been
tried and sentenced. Wisam Risk (sp?) is believed to be one of the men who
spent months digging a tunnel to the Commerzbank in the Zehlendorf area of
Berlin. He is not thought to have been in the bank himself and did not
take part in the robbery and hostage-taking. Nevertheless, Risk is
considered one of the leading figures in the robbery. According to Detlef
Buettner, who was the chairman of the now-defunct 'Koba' special
commission investigating the case, "We now have everyone who was directly
involved in building the tunnel and in the robbery itself". For Buettner
and his men, the case is now solved, but not closed. Over DM 4 million of
the loot is still missing, and one man is still free, although he is
thought to have been only a helper to the tunnel gang.
