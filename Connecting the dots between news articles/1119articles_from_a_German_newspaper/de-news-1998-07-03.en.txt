Unemployment down in May
</H1>
Last month saw another drop in unemployment, according to federal government
spokesperson Hauser (down by 120,000 to 4,075 million, as of May). The
average unemployment rate within Germany now stands at 10.5% - compared to
10.9% last year. The Nuremberg Federal Labour Office (Bundesanstalt fuer
Arbeit) will release their official figures on Tuesday. Mr Hauser justified
his jumping the gun as the press had done worse and already published wrong
data.

<P>
Chancellor Kohl said the new numbers meant a trend-reversal in the labour
market. He was convinced that the number of unemployed persons will drop
below the 4 million mark this autumn (fall). Mr Lafontaine, of the SPD, said
that Mr Kohl's optimism was part of his electioneering: prior to elections
usually more work-schemes would be set up. And apart from that, there would
always be more people in work in summer than in winter.

Mr Kohl defends government's policies regarding foreigners
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl defended his government's policy regarding foreigners.
Last night he said in Erlangen/Bavaria that the boat was full, as far as
the number of refugees was concerned: it would be hopeless endeavouring to
solve the world's plights and misery within the small territory of
the Federal Republic of Germany. People in need should get assistance in
their home countries. This had nothing to do with xenophobia - the dislike
of foreigners.

Morsleben shipments also broke nuclear activity limits
</H1>
Shipments of radioactive waste to the final depository at Morsleben/Saxony-
Anhalt now had high radio-activity readings. According to the newspaper
BERLINER ZEITUNG, the Federal Environment Ministry had confirmed this. The
material would have come from the de-commissioned reactor at Wuerggassen.
One of the transport-containers had shown readings above the set threshold
of 5 becquerel/square centimetre. Procedures had been followed, at the time,
when they had briefed the federal supervisory agency

Poland's Seym criticises Germany's resolution concerning expulsions
</H1>
Poland's parliament, the Seym, criticised Germany's resolution on
expulsions after World War II, as ambiguous and containing dangerous
tendencies. In May Germany's parliament had passed a resolution
(using the votes of the coalition partners) determining that the expulsion
of approx. 5 million Germans from currently Polish territory had broken
international law. And it also voiced hopes that, once Poland and Tchechia
had become members of the EU, they would not single out German refugees
but grant them the right to settle there, too.

attack on the Dolgenbrot refuge to between 15 months and 2 years jail,

were to move in.

Baden-Baden's Festival Centre managers sacked
</H1>
The managers of the privately-run local Festival Centre have
been sacked. Reiner Voegele (sp?) and Klaus Klein had made sure the
cultural events venue - opened less than three months ago - made it into
the headlines and bad books all the way. As ticket-prices were too
expensive, there was little patronage, but they kept giving away tickets
to keep appearances.

<P>
Mr Andreas Moelig-Zehphauser (sp?), who has a background in musicand theatre-science, will take over now.

according to the doctors treating him. Mr Daniel Nivelle (sp?), however,
still is in a coma and on a respirator. After the Worldcup soccer game
between Germany and Yugoslavia, he had been almost bludgeoned to death.
Two of the alleged criminals have been remanded in (a French) prison.
