Iran sues Siemens for DM8 billion
</H1>
Iran is suing the German electronics manufacturer Siemens for
DM8 billion in damages because the company never finished the
construction of a nuclear power plant after the Iranian Revolution. The
Iranian embassy in Bonn made the announcement, saying the Siemens did not
honour its contractual obligations. The company expressed surprise at the
announcement. A Siemens spokesman said that Iran's demands were completely
unjustified; in 1982 a court of arbitration was established which declared
the contracts absolved.
Siemens began building the nuclear power plant in 1974 under Shah Reza
Pahlavi. After the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the German government refused
the company the export permit for further materials.

SPD: international cooperation rather than wage cuts
</H1>
The SPD is promoting a two-pronged strategy of international
cooperation and reforms within Germany in response to increasing
interdependency in the global economy. Top politicians in the party agreed on
this course at an international economic congress of the SPD. Lower Saxony's
Premier Schroeder spoke of a milestone for the discussion in the party. SPD
leader Lafontaine explained that it is a matter of finding better answers
than cutting wages and social programs. He had already called several times
for international cooperation rather than cuts in response to global
competition. The party leader emphasized that everything possible must be
done to ensure that European monetary union can be realized, as planned, on 1
January 1999. Schroeder also came out in favour of monetary union, in
principle, but said it would only work if it were accompanied by common
European social policy.

Economic think-tank: Federal government should cancel savings package
</H1>
The German Economic Research Institute has called on the federal
government to cancel its savings package. According to the institute's weekly
report, the primary concern at the moment should be on boosting Germany's
weak economy - to which end higher deficits would have to be accepted for a
time. For example, say the researchers, the Solidarity Supplement should be
cut in half as of next year; only when investors and consumers were willing
to spend more money again could public deficits be reduced. The Institute
also criticized the government's planned income tax reform, saying that it
would provide relief primarily to higher-income earners; if the Value-Added
Tax were increased at the same time, it would be another blow to lower-income
earners.

UN refugee relief organization: Repatriation of Bosnians set for too soon
</H1>
The United Nations' Refugee Relief Organization considers the
planned date of 1 October to be too soon to begin sending Bosnian war
refugees home. The organization's German spokesman, speaking on Radio Hesse,
called on the federal states not to repeal the status of Bosnians as needing
protection yet. He said that given the division of Bosnia into a Serb and a
Muslim-Croatian part, returning refugees would have to fear for their lives
if they did not belong to the dominant ethnic group in their area.

Two doctors sue for closure of Krummel nuclear power plant
</H1>
Two doctors in Lower Saxony have begun legal proceedings at the
Higher Administrative Court in Schleswig to shut down the controversial
Krummel nuclear power plant. According to their lawyer, they are seeking the
interim shut-down of the reactor and the revocation of its operating license.
In their application, the plaintiffs refer to the increased incidence of
leukemia in the area around Krummel, adding that all indications suggest that
this clear increase is due to the operation of the power plant.
One of the doctors is a member of the state commission investigating the
incidence of leukemia in the Elbmarsch area.

Foundation for Product Testing: tap water in many cities contains lead
</H1>
Drinking water apparently contains lead in many German cities. The
Foundation for Product Testing has announced this finding. In some cases,
they said, the amount of lead in the water was well over the maximum
allowable amount, endangering especially the health of babies and infants.
The reason for this situation, the Foundation said, was the water lines,
which in many old buildings were often still made with lead. Primarily the
East German states and Hamburg are thought to be affected, but high lead
content was also found in other areas, such as the Ulm region. The federal
Environment Ministry ruled out the possibility of acute health risk.
