Clinton meets Schroeder
</H1>
The USA and the EU plan to enhance their relationship. US-President Clinton and
Chancellor Schroeder announced this at the end of their talks. Schroeder, at the
moment also EU-council president, is as optimistic as Clinton that both sides
will soon overcome their trading differences on hormone beef and bananas.
Besides both politicians announced a conference in mid July for the
reconstruction of the Balkan in Sarajevo. They did not say it explicitly and in
an open way, but it is a logical conclusion as Schroeder repeated word by word,
what he had already said yesterday about the difference between humanitarian and
economic help for reconstruction: They could not let anybody starve, because he
is ruled by the wrong president. But as long as Milosevic still has the power,
help like the Marshall plan for Yugoslavia is not a question, Schroeder and
Clinton said. Both did not start any discussion about the costs of the
reconstruction on the Balkan.

years. The speaker of the board of the Greens, Radtke, said the same.

Bishops talk about papal letter
</H1>
Since noon in Wuerzburg, the German bishops are looking for an alternative in
the newly started quarrel about pregnancy counseling. The chairman of the
bishops' conference, Lehmann, pointed out, that the papal letter does not want
the catholic church to leave the public counseling system completely. It is
rather a matter of modifying the counseling form, which is a condition for a
legal abortion. In the meantime, the Social Ministers of the states governed by
CDU/CSU appealed to bishops, to save the pregnancy counseling in catholic
institutions.
