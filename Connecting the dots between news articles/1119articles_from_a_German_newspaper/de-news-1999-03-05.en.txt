Federal Congress of the Greens Party
</H1>
The Greens Party delegates met at Erfurt for a 3-day meeting about the
elections to the European parliament. Ms Roestel, spokesperson for the
executive, kicked off the debate by asking for more social justice and
democracy in Europe. She was for a thorough reform of the EU plus giving the
the European parliament more clout. She also said the CDU/CSU's campaign
against dual citizenship was "setting bad anti-European signals". In many
states in Europe dual citizenship was something taken for granted. Currently
some 600 delegates are discussing the candidates for the elections to the
European parliament. Ms Ruehle, the party's former federal manager,
allegedly is on top of the short-list. The contentious debate about
reforms of structures, however, was postponed until tomorrow. Before the
meeting got under way, Foreign Minister Fischer and Environment Minister
Trittin, had asked for one of the two managers at the top of the party to
be 'dis-established'. This drew some flak from leading female Greens
politicians who felt this attempt was directed against women.

Ministers: Give Kurdish offenders a taste of law enforcement
</H1>
State and federal ministers for internal affairs agree on how to deal with
violent offenders belonging to the banned Kurdish PKK party. After meeting
with the 16 state ministers, federal minister Schily said that violence
similar to what had happened a fortnight ago would have to be avoided.
Kurdish offenders would have to get a taste of law enforcement, and if
required, even face deportation to Turkey. The SPD-politician stressed,
however, that constitutional and human rights would limit deportations
drastically. Several hundred persons showed up in Berlin, Erfurt and Aurich,
to peacefully demonstrate for the release of the head of the PKK, Mr Oecalan.

Acquittal of Cavalese pilot raises eyebrows
</H1>
President Clinton had talks with Italian head of state, Mr D'Alema, about
paying damages to the dependents of the victims killed when a US-fighter
plane severed a cable-car's cable, though he would not comment tonight,
according to the White House. Yesterday's acquittal by a US court still
raises plenty of eyebrows. Mr D'Alema had voiced criticism against the US
military court's verdict. Previously the mayor of Burgstaedt/Saxony,
Mr Naumann, had asked the US to pay adequate damages to the victims'
dependents. Seven of the twenty victims were from Burgstaedt.

How to pay for agriculture stays on Agenda 2000's agenda
</H1>
According to government spokesperson Reinhardt, the question of how to pay
for reforms in the agricultural sector will stay on the agenda for
the Agenda 2000 negotiations. Ms Reinhard said that the states opposing that
would have to come up with plans of their own, on how to stabilise European
spending for agricultural purposes. France's minister Glavany did not quite
get what Ms Reinhard was on about. Yesterday, when talking to his offsider
Mr Funke, he had been led to believe that this issue had already been dealt
with. The idea is to have the members states chip in, so Germany would be
less of a net payer. This strategy obviously would hurt France - who in the
past tended to be more on the receiving end.

Plans for dual citizenship under certain conditions
</H1>
Dual citizenship is expected to become an option for children born to
foreigners as well as long-time foreign residents. According to a discussion
paper by Mr Schily, federal minister for internal affairs, children born in
Germany to foreign residents should be able to apply for dual citizenship
until they make up their minds which one they want to keep once they turn
23. Dual citizenship would also become an option for residents who have
been in Germany for 30 years. Next Tuesday the coalition parties will talk
about this draft, together with Chancellor Schroeder
