Parliament (Bundestag) agrees to Germany's joining KFOR
</H1>
A big majority of the members of parliament (Bundestag) voted for the
deployment of another 8500 armed forces, to be part of the international
peace-corps KFOR. 505 were for the proposal, 24 against and 11 abstained.
Almost all speakers acknowledged the endeavours to end the war and
congratulated federal government to its success in the matter. As early
as this Friday, a first contingent of some 2000 German KFOR soldiers will
be deployed from Macedonia, and will probably reach the Kosovo region on
Saturday, together with British armed forces.

Mr Scharping: deployment of German soldiers "extremely risky"
</H1>
Defence Minister Scharping called the deployment of German armed forces as
part of the Kosovo peace-corps "extremely risky". They would be threatened
by landmines, booby-traps and attacks by "political pirates". It was
irrelevant if the latter were Serbs or part of the Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA). Mr Scharping emphasised that the soldiers' safety had absolute
priority. He would not be drawn on how long KFOR was planning to stay, but
if the past example of Bosnia was anything to go by, this could take
several years. The additional cost could be billions of marks.

Kosovo refugees not to be repatriated before the beginning of 2000
</H1>
The repatriation of the Kosovo refugees currently in Germany is not expected
to begin before next spring. According to Federal Minister for Internal
Affairs Schily, all must return, though not head over heels. Chancellor
Schroeder said that the Kosovo region would get comprehensive aid to rebuild,
though that was conditional on a speedy democratisation process in Belgrade.
As early as this Sunday, the first UN-convoy carrying food, blankets and
plastic tarpaulins for needy Kosovars will arrive in the region.

Mr Schroeder defends his ideas about modernising the party
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder backed the ideas he had formulated together with
British premier Blair, namely about modernising European social democracy.
When interviewed on TV ARD, Mr Schroeder declared that Mr Blair and he had
been driven by the requirement to face a global economy. He wanted to avoid
isolating the German SPD party as far as their ideology went. Mr Schroeder
will come back on this issue again on Wednesday, just before the G8-summit
meeting. The FDP party wants to put his ideas to a vote by name, in
parliament (Bundestag).

Berlin wants longer shopping hours
</H1>
The state of Berlin has moved a draft-law in the Upper House (Bundesrat)
to further relax shopping hours. It would provide for a general extension
of closing times to 10:00 pm. According to Berlin's Social Senator Huebner,
Sunday would stay as a rest-day. Consumers were very interested in extended
shopping hours. The Upper House (Bundesrat) passed the draft on to a select
committee. The unions were against the move.

More egg-testing in Germany
</H1>
After eggs tested for PCBs in the state of Hesse came up with positive
results, the tests are to be extended to all of Germany, where currently
eggs are being tested for dioxin. The Producers Association asked for
labelling of eggs to show their country of origin. So far 14,000 farms in
Belgium had been using dioxin-contaminated chicken-feed. Certificates of
compliance should clear the way for exporting Belgian meat products,
according to a decision by the EU Veterinary Commission
