Fire in refugee residence: one dead
</H1>
One man died in a fire in a residence for refugee
claimants in Friedrichshafen. The man was a 26-year-old Curd from Turkey.
An autopsy determined the cause of death to be carbon-dioxide poisoning.
The cause of the fire is not yet known. A 30-person special commission has
been established to investigate the case. The building has been closed in
order to avoid disturbing potential clues. According to the public
prosecutor's office, there are no concrete indications that an
anti-foreigner crime has been committed. Because the fire was in the
entryway and the stairway, many of the 300 refugee claimants from 27
countries jumped out of the windows of the 3-storey former barrack in
panic. Others tied bedsheets together and climbed down, some from the
attic windows. Emergency response personnel counted 53 injured, 5 of them
seriously; most were suffering from smoke inhalation, some from broken
bones.

Finance Minister retains office
</H1>
Thanks to the Coalition's majority of seats, Finance Minister Waigel
has passed a vote of confidence in the Bundestag. Chancellor Kohl
symbolically stood behind the minister in the Bundestag. In the
parliamentary debate, Kohl said that Waigel would remain in office. The
SPD and Alliance '90/the Greens had instigated a vote on dismissing the
minister. The leaders of those parliamentary groups, Scharping and
Fischer, were especially critical of the re-evaluation of Germany's gold
reserves, saying it was a crude trick meant to fulfill the criteria for
European monetary union on paper. Waigel himself, as well as Chancellor
Kohl and other members of the Coalition rejected the accusations. Kohl
emphasized that the federal government would do everything possible to
stick to the criteria and the schedule of the monetary union. Leader of
the SPD, Lafontaine, also demanded the timely realization of monetary
union. In reference to the re-evaluation of reserves, Fischer accused
Waigel of amateurism. Waigel admitted at the beginning of the 4-hour
debate that a final agreement with central bank about the reassessment had
not yet been reached. He also announced a new budgetary restriction, which
makes all expenditures over DM 1 million subject to the finance minister's
express approval.

Reassessment of gold reserves still in dispute
</H1>
Central Bank President Tietmeyer does not consider the question
of reassessing the bank's gold reserves to be settled yet. In saying so,
he contradicted Federal Finance Minister Waigel, who had spoken of a
compromise being reached. Attending the International Monetary Conference
in Interlaken, Switzerland, the president of Germany's central bank said
the discussions would continue. He said that no formal agreement had been
reached at talks yesterday, indeed the reassessment question had not been
addressed at all, but rather he and Waigel had dealt with other aspects of
the central bank's balance. Finance Minster Waigel, on the other hand, had
said that a compromise on the question of gold reserves had been reached.
According to his statement, the reassessment would be carried out this
year, but the profits not claimed until next year.

Public Prosecutor's office calls for acquittal of Safran Eid
</H1>
In the trial dealing with the case of a fire in a residence for
refugees, the public prosecutor's office has called for the acquittal of
Safran Eid. In the fire last year, 10 people dies and 38 were injured,
some seriously. Public prosecutor Michael Boeckenhauer said that the more
serious the charges are, the less doubt there may be, and that since there
was serious doubt about Eid's guilt, he should be acquitted. Eid and his
defence attorneys listened to the statement calmly, there was only one
cheer from the spectators' gallery. At the beginning of the nearly
4-hour-long address, Boeckenhauer  took to task the defence, the joint
plaintiffs, and the expert witness, Achilles. He accused the defence of
having condemned the public prosecutor's office and politicized the entire
proceedings for a whole year. He also said that many of the 100 witnesses
had been made to suffer at the hands of the defence.
