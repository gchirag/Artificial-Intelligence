Roeder's appearance at Bundeswehr academy will become Bundestag issue
</H1>
The speech given by right-wing extremist Manfred Roeder at the Bundeswehr
Executive Academy in Hamburg in 1995 will be discussed in parliament. The SPD
spokesman for defense policies, Kolbow, said to the Berlin daily "Tagespiegel"
that the Social Democrats would propose a topical discussion of the event in
the Bundestag. Kolbow also supports steps to punish Bundeswehr officials
involved in the affair.
The chairman of the Foreign Ministry comittee, Hornhus (CDU), also demanded
immediate background information and vigorous actions. He told the daily
newspaper "Neue Osnabruecker" that this would be the only way to show other
countries that every form of right-wing extremism is being fought against in
Germany.
In 1995, Roeder gave a talk at the executive academy in Hamburg on the topic
of Germans living in the district of Koenigsberg (Russia).

Ruehe to initiate personnel measures in Roeder case
</H1>
Federal Defense Minister Volker Ruehe will take appropriate steps in the
Roeder case. Commenting on the measures to be taken against the responsible
officers, Ruehe said, "First, legal disciplinary actions will be taken against
Colonel Schwarzer who, as head of the academic staff, carries direct
responsibility for Roeder's invitation. Second, the director of the executive
academy at that time, General Olboeter (sp?), asked me to be released from his
present job as head of the personnel department until the questions of
responsibility and supervision are settled. I complied with his request."

No compromise on new postal law
</H1>
The coalition and the SPD have been unable to agree on a new postal law. In
Bonn yesterday, both sides blamed each other for breaking off the talks. The
main arguments were the social standards demanded by the SPD. Without a
compromise in this question, the bill passed by the parliament most likely
will fail for a second time in the SPD-dominated Bundesrat this Wednesday. As
the currently valid postal law expires at the end of 1997 without any
substitution, the entire German postal market would suddenly be released to
free competition.

Life sentence for Kim Kerkow's murderer
</H1>
The regional court in Oldenburg sentenced the defendant Rolf Diesterweg to life
in prison for the murder of 10-year-old Kim Kerkow. In his reasoning, the
presiding judge said that Diesterweg had murdered Kim Kerkow viciously and in
cold blood. The court gave a life sentence because it considers the accused to
have been of sound mind at the time of the crime and thus fully accountable.
The court stated that the 34-year-old defendant committed the murder in order
to hide the preceding sexual assault on the child. The judges refused to order
his admission to a psychiatric hospital as Diesterweg would be too dangerous
for other patients. A treatment could at most take place behind bars.

BVS suit against Vulkan executive board members apparently rejected
</H1>
According to the newspaper "Duesseldorfer Handelsblatt," the Federal
Institution for Special Tasks Related to Unification (BVS) apparently
lost a suit seeking damages that it filed against former members of
the executive board of the collapsed Vulkan Verbund AG in Bremen. The regional
court in Bremen had rejected the civil law suit against the four chairmen
on November19th. The law suit against the former president and chief
executive officer of Vulkan, Hennemann, was separated and has provisionally
been suspended. The paper said that the case might be reopened if a criminal
law suit will be initiated. The BVS brought a charge against Vulkan because of
inappropriate expenditure of subsidies for its shipyards in eastern Germany.

Bank merger in Switzerland may be signal for mergers in Germany
</H1>
The "Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft" (Union Bank of Switzerland) and the
"Schweizerischer Bankverein" (Swiss Bank Corporation) will merge to form the
second largest bank corporation in the world (after Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi).
The new bank will be called "United Bank of Switzerland". This merger will
push the German "Deutsche Bank" to the third rank. The news of the merger
caused a rise in rates at the Swiss stock exchange for both banks (12% for the
Bankgesellschaft; 6% for the Bankverein). With Deutsche Bank now put on the
spot, bank coperations might also be possible in Germany. For that reason, the
rates of the large German banks rose by more than 3% during the course of the
morning.
