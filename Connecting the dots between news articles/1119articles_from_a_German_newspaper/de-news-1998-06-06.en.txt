ICE Death Toll Rises
</H1>
 The death toll for the ICE catastrophe has risen to 102.  The
emergency services center in Celle announced this morning that three more
bodies had been recovered.  Thereafter, experts began to go through the
site conducting forensic tests.  One possibility that will be tested is
whether the breaking of a wheel rim could have led to the derailment of
the high-speed train as has been suggested.  In this connection, German
Rail is considering a new security system for the ICE.  The key component
of it would be a system that warned of the presence of broken or derailed
wheels.  German Rail chief Ludewig said in a newspaper interview that once
the cause of the accident has been determined, a corresponding electronic
feedback system may have to be considered.

At noon the search for
accident victims resumed.  Shortly before this, rescue teams had been
surprised to find another body beneath the rubble.  The resumption of
salvage operations has forced the special commission that is investigating
the causes of the accident to interrupt its work for a while.

</H1>

there being a "partnership for labor" after the parliamentary elections.

belongs in the firms.  He also said that those who like the SPD want
to roll back reforms that have been made to pensions, worker's rights
and sick leave are endangering jobs.  BDI President Henkel emphasized
that a partnership for labor must not be used to legitimize any further
attacks on market outcomes.

Possibility of Placing Juvenile Offenders in Educational Homes
</H1>
 In the face of the high crime rate among youth and children,
Federal Justice Minister Schmidt-Jortzig demanded the option of being able
to place juvenile offenders in educational homes.  What was important
above all, he said, was a swift and convincing response for those children
who are in danger of falling into serious criminality.  He had no sympathy
for the idea of lowering the age at which one can be tried as an adult to
12 years old.  He said that any response must be made along educational
lines, because otherwise children would be punished because nobody cared
about them.
