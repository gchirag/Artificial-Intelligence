Liechtenstein's Justice Minister helps to uncover hidden accounts
</H1>
Liechtenstein's justice minister Frommelt has offered Germany
Help with uncovering the CDU's hidden accounts. The foundation
"Zaunkoenig" created by Hesses's CDU is located in Liechtenstein.
Today, Frommelt met with Germany's Minister of Justice Hertha
Daeubler-Gmelin. Their topic was a report by Germany's foreign
intelligence service BND. In the report Liechtenstein is called a large
laundromat for Columbian drug money. Mr. Frommelt complained that the
BND's accusations were sweeping generalizations that the BND could not
prove. The intelligence coordinator in the Chancellor's Office, Urlau,
was refusing Liechtenstein any information. There was not even a German
request for official help. Therefore, Frommelt was appreciating even
more that at least his colleague had talked to him. Although she
considered herself not in charge for some issues, she had promised to
do everything in her powers to improve the international cooperation
against organized crime. Liechtenstein's justice minister said that his
country at any rate would take care that it would not be an attractive
place for money launderers of any kind.
