Eichel breaks austerity package into two parts
</H1>
The federal government will in fact make changes to its austerity program.
As a result, the opposition can no longer block capping pension increases at
the rate of inflation over the next two years, said Minister of Finance
Eichel from Berlin. The reorganization of the budget will be divided into
two parts. 90% of the 30 Billion DM savings plan will be put into effect by
the end of November without approval from the Bundesrat. The remaining 3.5
Billion will be made up with savings in lump sum rent subsidies, support
payments, and civil service salaries. For this, the support of the Bundesrat
will be necessary. The CDU/CSU adjudged the breakup of the austerity
packages as a sign of an increasing lack of direction. But they did reaffirm
their willingness to engage in talks.

Saarland to eliminate 13th year of school
</H1>
The newly elected CDU government in Saarland wants to shorten the years of
study needed to reach the Abitur (graduation and university entrance exams).
As presented by Minister of Education Schreier in the newspaper
"Saarbruecker Zeitung", the change will affect all children who move from
primary school to the Gymnasium (the university-track secondary school) in
2001. This would make Saarland the first of all the former West German
states to implement the "Husum Resolution" for the reduction of years of
study, which was adopted only a few days ago at the conference of Cultural
Affairs Ministers.

Appeal process begins for Krenz, Schabowski and Kleiber
</H1>
Defense counsel pressed for acquittal in the appeal process of the last GDR
(East German) head of state, Krenz, and prominent SED (East German communist
party) members Schabowski and Kleiber. Before the Federal High Court in
Leipzig, Krenz' lawyers argued that he never gave any orders to the border
guards instructing them to shoot escapees. Also, since 1973 the SED
Politburo had been less and less involved with questions of border security,
they said. Krenz himself said the charges against him were groundless and
that he is no murderer. The federal prosecutor however, called for renewed
proceedings against Krenz, as well as stiffer penalties.
