Changing of the guard at Deutsche Bundesbank
</H1>
The Bundesbank ha a new president as of today. Outgoing president
Hans Tietmeyer had a gala farewell at Frankfurt's Palmengarten, which
included the presence of chancellor Schroeder and many other prominent
guests. Christian Democrat Tietmeyer had been occupying key positions
within Germany's finance and economic policy for over 30 years. Finance
minister Eichel praised Tietmeyers merits in defending the Deutschmark's and the Euro's stability. "You have greatly contributed to the
process of European unity. The stability of the Euro, the build-up of
the European central bank. European central bank means that we all sit
around this table on equal terms and work out policies. This is one
thing we Germans will have to learn a little better. It is your merit
that the Bundesbank succeeded in shaping the European bank on the
German model of working and thinking: the trend towards stability and
the status of independence." Ernst Welteke, who up to now had been
president of Hesse state's central bank, will be Tietmeyer's successor. Welteke favors an unemotional reaction to the Euro's present weakness. "Unemotional" does not mean "indifference", he says. The big
economies are especially responsible in the matter of attaining a
stable Euro exchange rate. Earlier, chancellor Schroeder had said he
was seeing good chances for a speeding up of economic growth in Germany.
His government's growth prognosis of 1.6% for the current year might
well be exceeded.

Muentefering's, the present minister of transportation, return to SPD

Economy "package" continued cause for internal SPD bickering
</H1>
The controversial economy "package" continued on the agenda of today's
meetings. The SPD state finance ministers and the economy specialists
of the Bundestag faction met in Wismar to discuss the issue. Main point
was the distribution of onus among federal and state governments. Some
states announced that they will not support in the upper chamber the
transference of costs from the federal to state areas (as planned for
rent subsidies). Vice party leader of the Bundestag faction Schwanhold
said there must be no threats from SPD Bundestag members of voting
against the package. They were to take back their position papers and
discuss them within the party. Finance minister Eichel apparently has
grown sick and tired of just promoting a popularity contest for his
package. In a press interview he said he expected Eastern German states
to support it in the Bundesrat, as a kind of show of good will towards
the renewal of the solidarity pact between the federal government and
the states. The renewal will not come up before 2004, but under a spirit
of give and take, the new states must come to understand that the
consolidation of the budget now is a precondition for the federal
government's ability to cope with its obligations for Eastern reconstruction.

<P>
CSU state group leader Glos is totally pessimistic. In view of
criticism from within SPD ranks, he doubts that the package will even
sail through the Bundestag, leave alone the upper chamber, were SPD
and the Greens do not have a majority.
Minister of the economy Mueller (independent) was critical of the
social democrats. He said SPD politicians were talking all the government's successes to shreds.
The Greens stressed that while they favor the package, they still think
that the shutdown of nuclear plants should be speeded up.

Eastern Germany's SPD annoyed by finance minister Eichel
</H1>
Finance minister Eichel's latest pronouncement caused irritation
within the Eastern SPD. He had coupled voting for the economy package
with extension of the solidarity pact. In an interview, he had said
that excessive indebtedness by the federal government couldn't help
much in reconstruction. Brandenburg's SPD minister of finance, Ms.
Simon, professed bewilderment.She said "he may be having just one of
these days". Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's SPD finance minister Ms. Kehler
chimed in calling Eichel's pronouncement "unfortunate". She does not
agree to making Eastern German reconstruction dependent on good
political behavior.

Future EU commissioners will be cross-examined by EU parliament
</H1>
Future EU commissioners will be grilled in Brussels. The 19 candidates,
14 men and 5 women, will have to sweat during their cross-examination
by the European parliament. Every one of the will be submitted to 3
hours of questioning not by the plenary, but by the respective special
committees who will be responsible for parliamentary control over the
future commissioners. After the hearings, the respective committee's
vote will be submitted to the parliamentary presidium. The parliament
cannot blackball individual candidates, but can withhold approval from
the commission as a whole.

<P>
Ingo Friedrich (CSU), vice president of the European parliament, says
both German candidates for the new commission lack qualification. The
candidate for ecological commissioner, Michaele Schreier (Green party)
has no international or even European experience, he said. Guenter
Verheugen (SPD), candidate for the external and security commissariat,
he accused of having gone too far in promising Turkey she would soon
become a Union member.

Tourism sector healthy and stable
</H1>
Economy minister Mueller called the situation of the tourism sector
healthy and stable. Overnight room occupations rose 5.3% during the
first semester. Talking to a Leipzig convention, Mueller nevertheless
spun some criticism. Impolite service personnel without knowledge of
foreign languages he cited as an example. He also chided the sector for
the widespread use of plastic chairs, tablecloths, and flowers in
restaurants.  2.8 million persons are reported to be working in Germany's tourist
sector.

Barmer Ersatzkasse will go to court
</H1>
According to the daily "Stuttgarter Nachrichten", giant health insurer
"Barmer Ersatzkasse" pretends to sue the tobacco industry for damages
in US courts. The information was obtained from a staff employee of
the insurance company who said that "Barmer" will ask for several
hundred million DM indemnity for the treatment of smokers' diseases.
They will, however, wait and see how US physicians' organizations fare
in their suits against the tobacco companies. US doctors accuse tobacco
companies of having for many decades maintained a campaign of misinformation with the intent of deceiving the population in the matter
of damage caused by smoking.

Grain harvest better than expected
</H1>
This year's grain harvest was much better than the unfavorable weather
at sowing time had led to expect. Agrarian minister Funke, in his
presentation of the 1999 agricultural report, said that more than 44
million metric tons had been reaped. This result was clearly above the
average over the last 5 years and a mere .8% below the 1998 harvest,
due to a reduction in planted area. This is good news for consumers,
according to Funke. "Our consumers will be able to buy food at favorable
prices, even when compared to other European countries. During 1998,
the price hike of .9% was in line with the general cost of living
index," he said.

Non-profit organizations work with support of commercial enterprises
</H1>
Several social and non-profit organizations appear to be collaborating
with commercial enterprises in Germany. The ARD television show "Report"
broadcast that some of these companies are receiving large commissions
paid from donations. Among the organizations working with so-called
pressure tactics to solicit new members and financial support are the
social organizations "Caritas," "Johanniter," and "Malteser" as well as
the environmental organizations WWF and BUND, according to "Report."
In one case, the "Caritas" organization in Wiesbaden is said to have
forwarded 80 percent of the profits from one collection to the company
in Austria that had been contracted. In light of these facts, the vice
chairperson of the Federal Labour Association in Social Marketing warned
against reduced donations and a loss of reputation.

DM from concerts in Germany.  There is a good chance that actions
against the tenor Jose Carreras will also be dismissed.
