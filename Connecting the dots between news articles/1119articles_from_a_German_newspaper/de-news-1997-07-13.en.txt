Kinkel: Advantages predominate in eastwards expansion of EU
</H1>
The Federal Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, believes that the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages in the planned eastwards expansion of the EU.
Apart from completing the process of monetary union in the EU, the
expansion of the community to the East is a key strategic challenge on the
threshold to the 21st century, Mr. Kinkel said in Bonn. However, admitting
new countries to the EU will mean drastic changes for the present fifteen
member states. Adaption difficulties, risks and costs will all have to be
dealt with. However, each previous expansion of the European Union thus far
has had only positive affects. The EU commissioners announced that they
would like to recommend the admission of six countries to the European
parliament. The countries concerned are Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, the
Czech Republic, Estonia, and Cyprus.

Mr. Bohl offers SPD additional talks
</H1>
The Secretary of the Chancellor's office, Friedrich Bohl, has offered the
Social Democrats (SPD) additional talks in an attempt to reach an agreement
on tax reform. Speaking in Bonn, Mr. Bohl said that the coalition was
prepared to enter into discussions during the parliamentary Summer recess,
above and beyond the scheduled working party meetings in order to reach a
satisfactory outcome. The CDU politician, however, did not specify on what
level the meetings should take place. At the same time, Mr. Bohl urged the
SPD to play a constructive role in the talks. If a tax reform is to live up
to its name, it must involve reductions from the first tax bracket right up
to the top tax rate, he said. The scale and order of the individual reforms
are still open to discussion, the Secretary stressed.

who have evaded taxes by investing billions in foreign countries. Advocates
of this suggestion are, among others, the FDP tax expert, Ms. Frick and
vice-chairman of the CDU middle class union, Mr. Schauerte. They told the
tabloid "Bild am Sonntag" that this was an opportunity to return some of
so-called fugitive money to Germany. Ms. Frick emphasized that the economy
is absolutely dependent on investment for safeguarding and creating jobs.
