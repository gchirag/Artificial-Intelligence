Kohl enters into conflict around Mykonos trial
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has entered into the conflict which has arisen from Iranian
murder threats against German prosecutors, in connections with the Mykonos
trial of Berlin.  In a letter to the Iranian President, Mr. Rafsanjani, Kohl
expressed his concerns about the latest political development which has the
potential to jeopardize the long-standing friendly relations between both
countries.  Kohl advocated avoiding further escalation.  At the same time, he
asked Rafsanjani to prevent a further aggravation of the situation in Iran.
The Chancellor pointed out that the Mykonos trial is not of a political
nature.  He said German jurisprudence is independent and German courts sort
out cases exhaustively.  Representatives of both countries have continued
their effort today of defusing current tensions.  Spokesman of the Government,
Mr. Hausmann, underscored in Bonn that there is no reason of adopting a
different attitude toward Teheran.  Despite the latest threats, Germany wants
to stick to the "policy of critical dialog".  Hausmann emphasized, however,
that Bonn will not bend under pressure or extortion.  The Iranian Ambassador
to Germany, Mr. Mousavian, commented on the latest anti-German protests in his
country that one should not equate the public and published opinion with the
official policy of Teheran.

Pension premiums at 20.3%
</H1>
On January 1, the premiums for the mandatory pension plan will increase from
19.2% to 20.3% of gross salaries.  This piece of legislation was passed by the
Bundestag, and is now up for Bundesrat approval.  Labor Minister Bluem
explained this increase demonstrates again the necessity to think about
adjusting the pension plan to the new challenges.  The head of the SPD
parliamentary group, Mr. Scharping, demanded a reduction of pension premiums
as well as unemployment insurance by 2% each.  This would lower the overhead
cost of employment, strengthen the purchasing power and could create up to
400,000 new jobs.  Scharping spoke at a meeting of the heads of the SPD
parliamentary groups of the European and State parliaments.

Round of talks about 1997 taxation laws without results
</H1>
Another round of discussions about the 1997 taxation laws has remained without
results today.  During the consultations of a subgroup of the mediation
committee of Bundestag and Bundesrat, the Coalition insisted that the tax on
cash assets be completely abolished.  Counter to that, the SPD wants to keep
that provision in place at least for personal assets.  An abolition of the tax
would lower tax revenue for the states on the order of billions of DM.  The
1997 taxation law also includes an increase of the tax on property purchases
from 2% to 3%.  Furthermore, modifications in the inheritance tax are planned.
The group is to continue the negotiations next Thursday.

Breuel and Seite allegedly knew about subsidy misappropriation
</H1>
According to a report by the Berlin newspaper TAZ, the President of the
Treuhandanstalt (THA) [privatization and restructuring agency], Ms. Breuel,
and Minister President Seite of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania had already
known about subsidy misappropriation at the Vulkan shipyards since the end of
1993.  TAZ refers to secret documents of the Federal Criminal Police.
According to these, the former chairman of Vulkan, Mr. Timmermann, had
informed THA and the state that subsidies for East German shipyards had been
used for investments in West German, in violation of their original
designation.  Up until now, the official line had been that the authorities
had learned about the wheelings and dealings at Vulkan at too late a time for
taking action.  In the afternoon, it was announced that a consortium under the
leadership of Rhein-Metall of Dusseldorf has bought the Vulkan spin-off Atlas
Elektronik.  Aside from Rhein-Metall, Badenwerk and British Aerospace are
members of the consortium.
