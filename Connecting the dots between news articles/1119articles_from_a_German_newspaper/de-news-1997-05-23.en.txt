Mr Gerhardt head of the FPD party once again
</H1>
Mr Gerhardt, current head of the FDP party, was confirmed in his job by
the delegates for another two years, with close to 85% of all valid
votes cast in favour of him. His right-wing challenger, Mr Kappel, only got
10% of all votes. Mr Bruederle, head of the Rhineland-Palatinate FDP, and
Ms Schmalz-Jacobsen, Federal Commissioner for Foreigners, were both voted
deputies for Mr Gerhardt. Ms Piper, head of the FDP in Saxony-Anhalt, was
voted additional deputy, and Mr Doering, head of the Baden-Wuerttemberg FDP,
re-instated associate. General Secretary Westerwelle also got back his
old job by 512 out of 589 votes. The delegates wrote these decisions into

</H1>
North-Rhine/Westphalia's head of the FDP, Mr Moellemann, did not get voted
back into the executive at the Wiesbaden party meeting, but his rival
Hirche did. Mr Moellemann had been in the executive's bad books, as he had
previously criticised Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt, and accused
Research Minister Ruettgers of not having achieved a thing - except for
announcements.

<P>
Former Federal Minister of Justice Leutheuser-Schnarrenberger, however,
returned to the party's executive, prevailing over her rival Ms Bock in a
second poll.

More discussions between coalition partners about tax-reforms
</H1>
General Secretary of the CDU Hintze warned the FDP against bogging
themselves down as far as the question of tax-reforms was concerned. Prior
to the Liberals' Wiesbaden party congress, Mr Hintze told the newspaper NEUE
OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG that, apart from consistent savings to consolidate the
budget, additional debt should be reigned in. Nothing should be ruled out or
in, and there should be no religious fights but rather factual discussion.
The FDP's budget expert Koppelin, however, asked the CDU and CSU to drop
plans to raise taxes to cover budget-deficits for good. He emphasised in
Wiesbaden that the FDP would not back any such strategy, and government
had better accept that if they wanted to stay in coalition with the FDP.
The FDP executive proposed a remit refusing to raise taxes in oder to cover
budget-deficits.
