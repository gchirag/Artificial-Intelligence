Walter Riester: "don't expect too much from pension reform"
</H1>
During a debate in the Bundestag, Walter Riester, the Federal
Employment Minister (SPD), has warned that people should not expect
too much from the planned pension reform. Riester promised that all
the money raised by the new eco-tax would be used to lower pension
contributions, but, he said, it would not be possible to do everything
that would be desirable. Riester welcomed the suggestion from trade
unions that the pensionable age should be lowered. Andrea Fischer, the
Federal Minister of Health, announced that she is planning substantial
changes in health policy, and introduced into the Bundestag an
immediate programme to cut the cost of health care for patients. The
CDU/CSU and the FDP criticised her programme, claiming that the
government would not have the money to finance it.

alight, 15 km from the coast. Dutch fire experts are to inspect the

should not expect too much from the new cabinet's first decisions, and
said that Chancellor Schroeder's government should be allowed a
'period of grace' which is longer than the usual 100 days, given the
seriousness of the current problems in the world.
