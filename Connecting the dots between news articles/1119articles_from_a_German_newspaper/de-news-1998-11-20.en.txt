Messrs Lafontaine/Trittin defend tax-reform draft
</H1>
Finance Minister Lafontaine and Environment Minister Trittin defended their
draft for an ecological tax-reform in parliament. During the first reading
they spoke of a long overdue change of direction. Now, compulsory
contributions to the state-run pension scheme may be lowered by .8% as of
1 April 1999, and that's when fuel tax will go up. The opposition parties
would have nothing of that, and called the eco-tax useless. They mainly
criticised that exemptions for certain businesses had been made on a
completely arbitrary basis. FDP-member Thiele said that Germany had
forged ahead without checking with any of the other EU-partners. Head of the
PDS parliamentary group Gysi said that government's plans were neither okay
from a social viewpoint nor did they make sense. Granting exemptions to
companies who used a lot of energy, would be utter rubbish.

Continued criticism of reform of casual jobs
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder's announcement that he wanted to reform the taxation
and contributions for the so-called casual jobs keeps drawing criticism.
Employees' union DAG compared it to selling a parcel containing little
goods yet plenty of (hot) air. The HBV union said that the chance to put a
stop to the avoidance of social security contributions had been missed.
Employers, however, were quite happy with the new system. Now the threshold
will be 620 marks/month (used to be 590 for East Germany only). Instead
of paying a set percentage in tax, employers now will have to pay
contributions to the public health-insurance and pension funds. Employees,
however, will gain no entitlements from health/pension insurance. Several
states now decided that they wanted compensation for the resulting
shortfall in taxes, and referred to relevant consultations in the Upper House
(Bundesrat)

Mr Schroeder admits errors
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder admitted that he had made some errors during his
first few weeks in office. His biggest error would have been that he placed
too much emphasis on speed, as far as some issues were concerned. In an
interview with the ARD network he admitted that it was perfectly okay that
the new government copped some flak for that. He defended his plans for a
reform of the so-called casual jobs: Finance Minister Lafontaine had taken
part in all the meetings and had made clear that the plan was feasible.
Mr Schroeder refuted Mr Lafontaine's proposal to change unemployment
insurance to a solely tax-based system. Apart from that, Mr Schroeder
emphasised that he would not exclude cuts to the social system.

Bavaria and North-Rhine/Westphalia plan close co-operation
</H1>
In the future the state governments of North-Rhine/Westphalia and Bavaria
want to co-operate closely, as far as European and financial policies are
concerned. That's what the two state premiers, Messrs Clement, SPD, and
Stoiber, CSU, declared in Dusseldorf. After three hours of talks they said
that states also had to put a stamp on Germany's future development as well
as Europe's.

Domestic secret service to keep 'observing' Scientology and PDS-party
</H1>
The domestic secret service (Verfassungsschutz) will keep an eye on the
Scientology Organisation and the PDS party, according to Internal Affairs
Minister Schily, SPD, who had just finished meeting with the state ministers
in Bonn. There still were doubts about the constitutionality, the goals and
the structure of the PDS. Observation, however, would not involve secret
service methods, as Mr Schily emphasised. Only a few days ago Mr Schily had
stated that there would have to be a rethink about the observation of the
PDS-party - in view of the recent coalition in the state of Mecklenburg-
Western Pomerania (SPD-PDS).

Environment ministers: raise safety-standards for sea traffic
</H1>
State and federal environment ministers asked for higher safety standards
for sea traffic in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. And apart from that,
shipping lines should be made responsible for damages in the future,
according to Baden-Wuerttemberg's Mr Mueller. Emergency and rescue services
have now started pumping oil from the tanker 'Pallas' (which had beached
close to the island of Amrum, in the North Sea). They had done so in spite
of a small fire on board that had not been put out yet, according to a
spokesperson for the environment minister in Kiel. As heat had not been as
intense as expected they had been able to start draining the oil earlier
than planned.
