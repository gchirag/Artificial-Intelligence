Nuclear waste containers still "on the road"
</H1>
The controversial train carrying nuclear waste containers (CASTORs) has
continued its way through Hessen to the interim storage site near Ahaus,
North Rhine-Westphalia without any more incidents. Officially, the route of
the train is unknown. The train is expected to arrive in Ahaus after dusk.
Individual protests along the train tracks did not cause any incidents. The
stations in Hessen were protected by large police and Border Guard forces.
A Border Guard officer was killed in an accident while on duty at the
Wuerzburg-Himmelstadt line. He was hit by a car-and-ride train, presumably
because he stood to close to the rails.
The Christian-Democrats (CDU) accused the Social-Democrats (SPD) of being
split-tongued regarding the CASTOR transports. The leader of the CDU
faction in the North Rhine-Westphalian parliament said the state premier of
North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Rau (SPD) had signed the Ahaus contract and now
his designated successor Clement is calling the transports nonsense.
Federal Minister for the Environment Angela Merkel stressed that the CASTOR
transports to Gorleben and Ahaus had been agreed by federal and state
governments.

UK Prime Minister Blair in Bonn
</H1>
Finally, Chancellor Helmut Kohl has found a reliable British partner for
the European cause. Contrary to former Prime Minister John Major the
current PM Tony Blair is considered pro-Europe. Blair was visiting Bonn
today. The meeting with Chancellor Kohl took three hours and concerned
mainly the European policy. Apparently, they agreed on many things. In a
press conference Blair said he would advance the common currency in a
constructive way when he takes over the chair of the EU council even though
the UK will not be taking part. Regarding the quarrel about who would
become first president of the European central bank Kohl said that a
decision would be made in early May. Both heads of state declared that a
mediating EU Middle East policy will continue in spite of the scandal about
British Foreign Minister Cook's Israel trip.
After the press conference Blair also met Gerhard Schroeder, the SPD
opposition's candidate for chancellor.

Rise of right-extremist violence
</H1>
Politically motivated violence has increased rapidly in Bavaria last year.
The increase of right-extremist violence was especially strong. This is the
most important message of the latest Bavarian intelligence report,
presented today by Bavarian Interior Minister Beckstein today. The number
of violent acts by skinheads and other neo-nazis rose from 19 in 1996 to 39
last year while the number of left-extremist violence decreased slightly. A
large portion of right-extremist violence was linked to rightist
demonstrations against a Wehrmacht exhibition on March 1 in Munich. [The
Wehrmacht was Germany's regular army until the end of World War II.]
Interior Minister Beckstein said the fact that 5000 old and new Nazis had
come together was evidence for a significant flow to the right-extremist
NPD (National Party of Germany) and its youth organization. The young
National-Democrats were intensifying their contacts with violent skinheads
according to intelligence reports. Two thirds of apprehended offenders were
under 21 years.

Internet Liberty
</H1>
The Federal Association for Information and Communication Systems has
warned against too many government regulations for the internet that would
restrict competition. The information industry had to fight these
regulations decisively. The internet had to remain free of taxes and
customs duties. This was the only way of entry for enterprises into the
electronic business market of the future.

Stock market and foreign exchange
</H1>
Just in time for spring the DAX crossed the 5000 point mark today. Although
the record made stock brokers happy it was against forecasts by major
German banks who had predicted at the beginning of this year that the DAX
would reach at most 4600 points this year. During the past days it looked
as if the DAX would cross the threshold but it was only last night when the
US markets provided the last push. Many optimists on the floor consider
5200 points a realistic target for the next days. The conditions would be
as good as never before, no hint of interest increases, excellent figures
for such companies as Krupp, BASF and BMW, and a low inflation rate. At the
same time, the more careful warn against this euphoria. They predict a
rebounce to 4700 points. The suspense remains and Monday will show which
way the market will turn. It remains the fact that not too few people have
earned a wealth at the stock exchange during the last days. Especially in
the new market some company shares have doubled their value.
