Seven Leading Industrial States Count on Rapid Economic Growth
</H1>
Supported by the strong dollar, the seven leading industrial states
can count on rapid economic growth this year.  This is made clear in
a report concerning the world's economic situation which was
given by the director general of the international monetary fund
at the beginning of the G7 meeting in Berlin.  Germany too could
count on visible growth, Federal Minister for Finance, Mr. Weigel
stated.
The global economy's external requisites for economic growth, he
continued, were absolutely favorable for the G7 countries,
and Germany was included in this prognosis.  The international
monetary fund was counting on quotas above 2%, Mr. Weigel continued.
To be sure, in the face of the most recent unemployment figures, the
Federal Republic would definitely have to execute the necessary
structural reforms.  In this regard, some of he European neighboring
countries and the USA were already ahead of Germany, he continued.
For this reason, the strength of the dollar in the international
monetary exchange market would have to be considered a natural
development in the face of the stable economic situation of the USA
and compensation for the former undervaluation of the dollar.
In connection with this, the president of the Federal Bank, Hans
Tiedtmeier, added that the strength of the dollar did not signify a
weakness of the German mark.  To be sure, the most recent course
corrections should be completed soon.

CDU Against Employment Summit with Federal President
</H1>
 The CDU does not like the leading SPD politicians' suggestion
that an employment summit be held by President Herzog.  The
Christian Democrat Minister President of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Mr.
Seite, said, that such a summit should be under the jurisdiction of
the federal government, not of the federal president. Anyway, there
was just a lot of silly talk at roundtables, he continued.  SPD
Minister Presidents Beck and Eichel had suggested the summit with
the Federal President. There should be immediate action in the face
of almost 4.7 million unemployed, they stated.  They also said that
the federal president had greater authority than the chancellor.

Dramatic Rise in Consumption of Designer Drugs
</H1>
Sales of the designer drug XTC are booming.  According to the
STUTTGARTER NACHRICHTEN, this is the conclusion of a study of the
consumption of narcotics in 1996 which the federal government is
about to publish.  During the first 11 months of 1996, the number of
first time consumers of amphetamines and related drugs who were
known to the police rose by almost 50 per cent and reached a new
high at 6 231.  The number of confiscations  of XTC pills also
indicates the growing danger of synthetic drugs.  By the end of
November, approximately 600 000 pills were confiscated in all of
Germany.  That amounts to 220 000 more than in 1995 and that figure
was reached without even taking last December into consideration.
The majority of  all confiscated XTC amounts, 98 per cent to be
exact, originated in laboratories in the Netherlands.  It has not as
yet been determined how many people died last year as a result of
XTC consumption.  By the end of September, the Federal Crime Bureau
had counted 14 deaths by XTC users.  In the year 1995, there was a
total of 17.
