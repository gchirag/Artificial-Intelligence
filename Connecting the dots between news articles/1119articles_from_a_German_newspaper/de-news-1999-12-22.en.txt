Schaeuble: Kohl should reveal names of donors
</H1>
The executive board of the CDU has urgently appealed to honorary chairman
Kohl to reveal the names of the donors of the two million marks to which he
has alluded. After a meeting of the executive board, CDU head Schaeuble said
the CDU's financial trustees had presented only incomplete documentation.
Some of the documents were not available because their period of safekeeping
had expired, others were lost in an office move. There is nobody besides
Kohl who can clear up the affair, said Schaeuble. The public prosecutor's
office in Bonn rejected statements that it was planning to initiate a
preliminary investigation against Kohl.

Coalition reaches consensus in arms export restrictions
</H1>
In internal discussions lasting several weeks, the red-green coalition has
come to an understanding regarding more restrictive guidelines for German
arms exports. This was reported from Berlin by Chancellor Schroeder's
foreign policy adviser, Steiner. According to Steiner, the draft of the new
guidelines, which still must be approved by the cabinet and the Bundestag,
refers more strongly than in the past to human rights. Arms exports would in
general be prohibited if a reasonable suspicion existed that the weapons
would be misused for internal repression or violations of human rights.

In the opinion of leading economists, the new millennium will open with
strong economic growth in Europe. The gross domestic product for those
countries linked by the Euro common currency will grow by 2.8%, according to
a combined prognosis by six top European political economists, which was

fall below the 10 percent mark, they predicted. Other predictions were for
inflation to stay moderate, at 1.6%, and the exchange rate of the Euro to
grow to 1.13 against the dollar.
