Discussion about capital tax
</H1>
Reinhard Klimmt, the Minister President of the Saarland, continues to
criticize Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. He doesn't think very
highly of the Chancellor's suggestion to leave the decision of whether to
collect capital gains taxes or not up to the individual states. Klimmt
feels that there must be some sort of uniformity. The FDP's speaker on
economic policy, Rainer Bruederle, accused Schroeder of chickening out by
saying that capital gains taxes are not the federal government's
responsibility.

Unemployment figures
</H1>
The Federal Labor Office estimates that the number of unemployed persons
in Germany will once again peak at over 4 million for July. Vice President
Siegers told the "Welt am Sonntag" that the new regulations regarding
nominally independent contract work has made the situation worse, and he
predicts that the numbers for the Fall will be even worse. Approximately
3,940,000 German residents registered for unemployment in June.

Trouble again at German Railways
</H1>
There was another incident at German Railways. A spokesman for the company
confirmed that the authorities had to automatically brake the Intercity
505 "Schauinsland" on the Hamburg-Basel line near Bremen. The
approximately 250 passengers escaped with no more than a fright. German
Railways provided a replacement train for their passengers in Cologne. One
possible cause for the incident is sloppy repair work on the tracks. The
public prosecutors are investigating the incident and have no suspects at
present.

Chaos on the roads
</H1>
The roads in Southwestern Germany were not as congested as had been
predicted. The police reported heavy traffic but no large traffic jams.
The largest traffic jam (30 km) was located on the A7 between Ulm and
Kempten. On the other hand, traffic was clogged in other parts of Germany.
Vacationers on the Baltic Sea had to have a lot of patience when driving
to their accommodations.

now Berlin native Joern Reuss.
