Armed Forces to stay in Bosnia for another year
</H1>
A large majority of parliament voted for extending the armed
forces' deployment in Bosnia, keeping Germany's total at 30,000 soldiers
within the SFOR-group. On Monday, the UN Security Council had renewed the
troops' mandate for another year. During the debate about the extension,
leading members of the Greens Party distanced themselves from party spokesperson Trittin's statements in this matter. Foreign politics speaker
Poppe even asked for his head. Mr Trittin had said, at a swearing-in
ceremony of new recruits in Berlin, that the Armed Forces were continuing
fascist traditions

Final report of Commission of Enquiry into Sects
</H1>
Another item on today's agenda in parliament was the final report of the
Commission of Enquiry into Sects. In a nutshell: the commission found,
after two years of investigations, that sects and similar groups posed no
threat to democracy for the time being. Scientology, however, was a special
case: they were a politically extreme organisation that warranted further
supervision by the Secret Service. The commission, amongst other things,
asked for a body to be set up to do these things more effectively. And they
also wanted laws to enable consumers to make better choices when it came to
offers for counselling/support.

Mr Kanther: No global ban on repatriation of refugees from Kosovo region
</H1>
Federal Interior Minister Kanther does not want a general ban on
repatriation of refugees to the Kosovo region, as fighting did not happen
everywhere in that region. Today future US-ambassador to the UN
Richard Holbrook once again talked turkey to Yugoslavian president
Milosevic. If he did not withdraw his special armed units from the Kosovo
region soon, there would be a NATO airstrike.

Armed Forces in Federal Auditor's firing line
</H1>
The Armed Forces got into the Federal Auditor's firing line. In a
confidential report the Federal Auditor's Office claimed that the Armed
Forces' airplanes were being used for questionable transports again and
again. The newspaper HANNOVER'SCHE ALLGEMEINE ZEITUNG published some
details. According to the paper, the Armed Forces would have shipped 30 tons
of beer to outposts in North America last year. And even whole brass-bands
would have been flown to the Octoberfest in Munich (to play there). In
total, only some 57% of all passenger flights would have been on business.
The auditors also thought that purchasing more long-range planes would not be
justified from a financial viewpoint. The cost of the service had more than
doubled between 1988 and 1996, now totalling 275 million marks. The
Ministry of Defence refuted the claims vigorously.

Proposal for new tax transfer-system between federal states
</H1>
Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg presented a revamped model for
transfer-payments (to compensate for differences in tax-revenue between
federal states). They proposed to limit the take from richer states to 50%
(currently up to 80%). Both state premiers were confident the system would
be in place as of 2000, and they also emphasised once again that they would
go to the Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht) to get the
current system overturned. The state of Hesse intends to follow suit.

Global quashing of Nazi court verdicts repugnant to justice
</H1>
Today the Upper House (Bundesrat) globally quashed all Nazi court
rulings repugnant to justice. There had been long-lasting bickering in
parliament (Bundestag), but finally the respective law was passed in May.
This rehabilitates several 100,000 victims of Nazi justice. Neither victims
nor their descendants, however, will be entitled to any compensation.
Reason: compensation had already been covered by previous legislation.

Italy takes another former SS-officer to court
</H1>
More than a year after Erich Priebke had been sentenced in Italy, another
former SS-officer was taken to court there today. A Turin military court
accused former Hauptsturmfuehrer Theodor Seweke of having ordered the
shooting of 15 prisoners in Milan in 1944. According to the prosecution,
the 87-year old's case is special in view of his unfettered career through
the ranks of of police force and counter-intelligence in postwar Germany.
