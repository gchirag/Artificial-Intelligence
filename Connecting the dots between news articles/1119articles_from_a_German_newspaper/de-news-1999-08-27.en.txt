Chancellor Schroeder wants pension-reform handled separately
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder apparently changed tack in the controversy about
pension reform. The plan to index pension-rises to the rate of inflation
for the next two years, is to be treated separately from the rest of the
budget-cutting exercise. This would mean that the current Read-Green
coalition's majority in the Lower House (Bundestag) would be sufficient to
pass the law - no need for the Upper House (Bundesrat) to get involved,
where majorities are uncertain. In the latter, the state of Saarland, among
others, had already voiced concerns.

<P>
According to government spokesperson Heye, the package-deal containing
budget-cuts will not be revisited. In the afternoon he refuted claims by
the press that Chancellor Schroeder planned to get the pension-reform passed
by the Lower House (Bundestag), but not by the Upper House (Bundesrat).
The planned pension-reform had been criticised quite vehemently by the
unions and welfare groups.

to concentrate more on his party. Mr Muentefering said that would be ready

Party Manager's job. Currently Mr Schreiner is Federal Party Manager, but
his contract will run out in December.

Radical reforms at construction workers' union (IG Bau)
</H1>
In view of falling membership-numbers, the union for construction,
agriculture and the environment decided on a radical reorganisation. At a
special congress, a vast majority of the delegates voted for abolishing the
twelve state organisations. At the same time, the federal organisation will
be extended and grouped by industry-sectors. Head of the union Wiesehuegel
expects that this will cause his organisation to become closer to what's
happening at the pit-face. He also said that the union suffered from
falling membership-numbers, not enough young people and falling revenue.
Currently the union has 600,000 members, down from 720,000 in 1996.

accused of several cases of graft and embezzlement. Between 1993 and 1997

Petrol and diesel go up
</H1>
According to the automobile association ADAC, high-octane petrol went up by
.08 marks in Munich during the last four weeks, and the situation was
similar in Nurnberg and Hamburg. Prices, however, were markedly lower in
Magdeburg and Dresden. The ADAC thinks that the substantial rises are not
only due to the rising cost of oil; they claim that oil-companies also
shelter behind the recent tax-rises to boost their own margins.
