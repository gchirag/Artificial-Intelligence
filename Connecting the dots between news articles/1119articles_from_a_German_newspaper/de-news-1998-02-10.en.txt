Four killed in shootings at German borders
</H1>
Four police officers were killed today in Germany at the Swiss and 
Polish
borders. A German and a Swiss officer died this morning in Konstanz in a
hail of bullets from a weapons trafficker who had tried to force a 
border
crossing. Immediately after the shooting the man shot himself. He was 
taken
to hospital where he died later that night. Police found explosives, 
hand
arms, and a machine gun in the man's car. His motive is still unknown.
At the German-Polish border crossing Ludwigsdorf, near Goerlitz, Saxony, 
an
apparently psychologically disordered man from Kazakhstan killed two 
German customs officers. The officers were checking a coach when one of 
the
passengers suddenly opened fire. The officers returned the fire but were
shot dead. The injured man was apprehended. The prosecution reported 
today
that the shooting was rather an uncontrolled outburst than targeted
criminal action.

Positions unchanged in third bargaining round for public service
</H1>
The collective bargaining talks for the public service have been 
adjourned this
evening without result. Representatives of the bargaining committees
said talks would be taken up again in the first week of May. A 
definitive
date has not been set yet. The public service unions OeTV and DAG
will apparently set an ultimatum for the forth round of talks, demanding
either an offer by the employers or declaring the talks failed.
In today's third round the positions remained unchanged. Again, the
employers refused to present any offers in spite of country-wide 
protests
by more than 25,000 public service workers. Interior Minister Manfred
Kanther [representing the employers side] had declared immediately 
before
the start of the third round of talks that there would be no offer as 
long
as the unions refused to negotiate topics demanded by the employers. The
unions demand a bulk pay-rise of 4.5 percent and a focus on job 
security.
The employers demand a zero net increase and fight for cuts in sick pay 
and
old-age pension additions.

Nursing insurance: no decrease of contributions but neither better = benefits
</H1>
Contributions for the nursing insurance will not be decreased. FDP 
leader
Wolfgang Gerhart said after a meeting of coalition representatives that
this meant , in return, that already agreed [more expensive] improved
benefits of nursing insurance have been cancelled. Gerhart stressed that
discussions with CDU/CSU had been intense. The coalition partner refused 
to
accept the Liberal's demand to reduce the contributions from 1.7 to 1.5
percent. Therefore, the parties have agreed that the additional benefits
package with estimated costs of 260 million DM annually will not come 
into
effect.

Centenary of Bertold Brecht
</H1>
The one hundredth birthday of Bertold Brecht is being remembered today 
in
Germany. The Bavarian Minister President Stoiber, attending a ceremony 
in
Augsburg, said that for too long Brecht had been the lost son of 
literature. But
at the same time Stoiber strongly criticised the Marxist political 
ideals of the
writer. The director of the Munich Staatstheater and president of the 
German
Stage Association, Everding, pointed out that nowadays there is no 
theatre
without Brecht. Several theatres between Flensburg and Augsburg are 
showing
the "Threepenny Opera" and "The Good Person of Szechwan".

Investigation of Scientology
</H1>
In one of the largest investigations of the Scientology organisation in 
Germany
the Munich police have taken numerous statements. According to the 
leading
prosecutor, around 130 policemen and three lawyers were searching for 
proof
for three current preliminary proceedings concerning the death of a
businessman and three arson attacks. The Munich businessman is alleged 
to
have been forbidden by Scientology members from taking medication other
than a large number of vitamin tablets, despite having a serious 
illness. The 56
year old died last summer after being in a coma for several weeks.
