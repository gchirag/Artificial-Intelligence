</H1>
As previously announced, the German state of Sachsen filed suit
against the European Commission at the European court. A speaker for the
state's government confirmed the fact today. By filing this suit, Sachsen tries
to get the EU to take back the cuts in subsidies for the Volkswagen
plants in Mosel and Chemnitz. The Government will decide on Tuesday whether
to join the suit.

</H1>

policies regulating subsidies for East Germany. In a FOCUS interview, he
criticized the current structure, mentioning that commercial districts not
used by anyone were especially supported. As well Schroeder mentioned that
the tax system encouraged the construction of luxury housing, helping the
capital gains of the rich upper class in the West, but of little use to
people in the East. In farming, he suggested helping individual farmers and
families instead of large-scale farms.

SPD just says No to planned cuts
</H1>
The Social Democrats (SPD) stick to their "No" to the savings package proposed
by the Federal Government. The day before scheduled talks in the arbitration
committee of Bundestag and Bundesrat Rudolf Scharping, head of the SPD
parliamentary group in the Bundestag, said on Deutschlandfunk radio that his
party's delegation on the committee was still opposed to the proposal.
He himself saw no chance of realizing plans intended to loosen the laws
governing the termination of work contracts, shorten the continued payment
of wages during sickness and raising retirement age for women. The SPD was
as well prepared to block the planned delay of an increase of family allowance
and abolition of the luxury tax. Scharping accused the Government of steering
head-on into confrontation with employees.
Scharping also opposed an increase in the Value added tax, calling it a poison
for demand, economic boom and job creation.
