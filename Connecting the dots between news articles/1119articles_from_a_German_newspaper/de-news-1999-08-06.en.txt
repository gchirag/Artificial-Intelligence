No Sunday trading for department store KAUFHOF on Berlin's Alexanderplatz
</H1>
The department store KAUFHOF on Berlin's Alexanderplatz lost in court once
again after trying to sell the complete range on Sundays. The Higher
Administrative Court (Oberverwaltungsgericht) confirmed the Administrative
Court's (Verwaltungsgericht) ruling, so offering goods without local context
for sale as souvenirs after 4 p.m. on Saturdays or on Sundays, will be
against the law. The store now will stay closed on Sundays. In the city of
Halle, however, five shops are allowed to sell their entire range on
Sundays, according to the Administrative Court (Verwaltungsgericht), whereas
shops in Dessau have to stay closed on Sundays

Federal Justice Minister critical of law-breakers (shopping-hours)
</H1>
Federal Justice Minister Daeubler-Gmelin vehemently warned cities and
companies against breaking the law on shopping-hours. She said that laws
that had been passed correctly, had to be adhered to. It would be
unacceptable if lobby-groups thought that the law would not apply to them,
and that also went for the public quite unashamedly cheering on the lawbreakers. Some 62% of the population of Germany was against Sunday trading,
according to research institute 'dimap'.

Mr Schaeuble welcomes Mr Struck's tax-initiative
</H1>
Head of the CDU Schaeuble welcomed Mr Struck's latest initiative as common
ground for agreements on the tax-reform. The top-rate would have to be less
than 40%, so reaching an agreement on that basis should not take long, as he
stated in an interview with a newspaper. He also mentioned that for years the
SPD had kept the CDU from lowering the tax-rate to 39%. Mr Struck had pleaded
for a radical tax-reform featuring 3 brackets only: 15, 25 and 35%. This
had raised some party-colleagues' hackles.

</H1>
40-year old camera-operator Olaf Ullmann from Frankfurt/Oder passed away. He
died of yellow fever in Berlin's Virchow Hospital. A special laboratory for
tropical diseases had checked his blood for several viri. Initially, yellow
fever had been ruled out, as Mr Ullmann allegedly had been vaccinated
against it. Ebola-, Lassa-, dengue- and Marburg-viri had already been ruled
out before he died. According to the Berlin authorities, the general
population had not been at risk.

</H1>
German Telekom will buy British mobile telephone company One2One for the
equivalent of 19.6 billion marks. German Telekom also said that, apart from
spending 6.7 British pounds on purchasing the company, they would spend
another 2.5 British pounds on liabilities One2One had run up. Once the deal
has been finalised, Telekom will have some 12 million mobile-phone customers
in Europe. For weeks, the future of One2One had fed the rumour-mill. Some
punters thought that Mannesmann could also be interest. The EU-Competition
Commission still has to agree to the deal.
