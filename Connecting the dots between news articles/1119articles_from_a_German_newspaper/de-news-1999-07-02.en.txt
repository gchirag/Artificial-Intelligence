defence of the proposed cutbacks by the government were marked by strong

Schroeder. It is his responsibility as head of government to look after the
well-being of the entire nation and not just the interests of some
individuals. His speech was accompanied by boos and whistles. President of
the Farmers Union Mr Sonnleitner said no other group in Germany has to bear
such a heavy financial burden as do the farmers. The eco-tax, EU
