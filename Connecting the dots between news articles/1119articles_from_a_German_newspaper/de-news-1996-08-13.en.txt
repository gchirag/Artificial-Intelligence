Improved water quality of lakes and rivers
</H1>
 Higher water prices have caused the consumption of drinking water in
Germany to drop even further.  Each citizen consumed an average of 132 liters
per day in 1995, while the average was 135 in the previous year.  This was
reported in the annual report of Federal and State Water Resource Policy
released today by the Ministry for the Environment and the Agricultural
Ministry.  According to the report, the quality of rivers and lakes improved
noticeably in 1995 as well.  This is due to new purification facilities and a
reduction in industrial pollution.  Particularly noticeable was the decrease
in pollution in the new states.  For instance, the Elbe was removed from its
1989 classification "ecologically destroyed".  The politicians criticized the
enormous difference in waste water fees between the East and West.  The
prices fluctuate between 70 Pfennig per cubic meter of water in Bavaria and
13 DM in Brandenburg.  Despite increased water protection fees, the Ministry
does not anticipate drinking water fees to increase in the next few years.

Germany requests extradition of Nazi criminal Priebke
</H1>
 The Federal government has requested the extradition of former SS
Officer Priebke from Italy.  The Ministry of Justice reported that the
request was handed to the Foreign Ministry in Rome last night.  Priebke is
accused of participating in the shooting of 335 hostages in Rome in 1944.  An
Italian military court acquitted him of the crime at the beginning of August,
stating the statute of limitations had run out.  This was based on an arrest
warrant issued by the Dortmund Prosecutors Office, which accuses Priebke of
murder.  According to the European Extradition Agreement, the Italian
government must decide within 40 days whether the former SS Officer must now
face a German judge since his acquittal by a military court in Rome.  Despite
Germanys request, it is unlikely that Priebke will be extradited to Germany.
 On the one hand, after the trial in Italy, the prosecutors office and other
petitioners announced that they want the decision declared invalid and a new
trial ordered.  On the other hand, other investigations into Priebke are
underway in Italy, as he is also suspected of participating in other war
crimes.  Priebke, 83, has stated that he would fight extradition to Germany
and continue his trial in Italy, if necessary.
