Greens' Special Party Congress in Bielefeld
</H1>
At the Greens' special party congress on the conflict in Kosovo,
the leadership was able to pass its compromise motion. It received 444 votes
to the 318 votes for the alternate motion proposed by the party's left wing
which supports Bundestag member Christian Stroebele. The alternate motion
demanded an indefinite and unconditional cessation of the NATO air strikes in
Yugoslavia. The delegates voted instead to call for a temporary cease-fire so
that Serbian troops could withdraw from Kosovo. The motion explicitly
supports Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer's position and averted a breach in
the governing coalition with the SPD for the time being. The party congress
in Bielefeld took place amid massive police presence. Several hundred
opponents of the war in Kosovo pelted police and delegates with eggs and bags
of dye. Fischer was hit by a dye bag and was treated and released after an
injury to his ear. Police arrested and detained approximately 60 protesters.

incapable of governing.

Criticism of Federal President's Pension
</H1>
The Association of Taxpayers has criticized the amount of the pension the
Federal President receives as too high. Association Vice President Dieter Lau
said in an interview with the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper that it was
incredible that Federal President Roman Herzog would continue to receive his
monthly salary of 30,000 DM for the rest of his life. Reducing his pension to
75% of his entitlement would be reasonable.

Mishap After Mishap for German Railways

The series of mishaps for German Railways continues. Another freight train
car has derailed on the stretch between Hanover and Goettingen, causing the
central north-south artery to be closed for the entire day. Long-distance
trains were delayed up to 40 minutes. All ICE connections were also affected.

Flooding in South German and Switzerland
</H1>
Kempten / Bern. Heavy rainfalls coupled with thawing snow in the mountains
has caused the Danube to overflow its banks. The situation is particularly
precarious in Allgaeu and in the Bernese Oberland where streets have had to
be closed and some trains discontinued. No ships are permitted on the Danube
river between Kehlheim and Regensburg. The water on the upper Rhine was also
at record levels, although no people are in imminent danger. Switzerland,
where flooding has already caused millions in damage, is preparing for a
hundred-year flood.

Best Time for Schumacher in practice runs
</H1>
It's a promising start at the Monaco Grand Prix for Michael Schumacher, who
had the best time in the free session in Monte Carlo in his Ferrari - about a
tenth of a second faster than defending champion Mika Hakkinen driving a
Mercedes-McLaren. The session was disappointing for Heinz-Harald Frentzen and
Ralf Schumacher. Schumacher in a Williams only made 16th place, and Frentzen
in a Jordan was 19th.
