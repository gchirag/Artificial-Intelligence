CDU executive meeting confirms Schaeuble
</H1>
CDU president Wolfgang Schaeuble is said to resign. These
rumours surfaced in connection with the meeting. Possible successors
are said to be Baden-Wuerttemberg State Premier Erwin Teufel and
Governing Mayor of Berlin Eberhard Diepgen. Before the meeting,
Schaeuble was strongly criticized. Thuringia's State Premier Bernhard
Vogel said, someone who has failed could not be leader of the party.
After the executive meeting, the president of the CDU faction of the
North Rhine-Westphalian legislature Linzen and Baden-Wuerttemberg's
State Premier Teufel said, the CDU presidency had made clear that if
Schaeuble resigned the entire executive board would resign as well.
The party leaders also called on ex-chancellor Helmut Kohl in a motion
to suspend his honorary presidency until he has named his donators. At
the same time, the presidency apologized to the Jewish citizens for
Manfred Kanther's lies in connection with the million mark transfers
from foreign accounts. The most dramatic paragraph of the motion by the
CDU leadership was probably that for the first time, the leadership
clearly distanced themselves from former Chancellor Kohl.

CDU and FDP against self-dissolution of Hesse's parliament
</H1>
The CDU and FDP factions of the Hesse legislature have
argued against a self-dissolution of the parliament. CDU faction leader
Kartmann said after the deliberations that the factions continued to
support State Premier Roland Koch. In a joint motion, SPD and Greens
intended to dissolve the legislature because of the CDU finance
affair. SPD and Greens need the support of at least two members of the
coalition to pass the motion. Federal Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer
called on CDU and FDP to support the opposition's motion. The Green
minister argued they should do so not only because the
Christian-Democrats had illegally financed their election campaign and
thus distorted the rules of competition, but also because there would
be further disclosures in the affaire and the dissolution of the
legislature would become obligatory.
