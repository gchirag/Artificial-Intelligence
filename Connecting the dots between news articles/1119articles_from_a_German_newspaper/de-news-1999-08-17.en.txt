Emergency talks about drug plan budget
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Angelika Fischer and representatives of
registered physicians and public health insurers have met for more
emergency talks on the drug plan budget this afternoon. Before the talks,
SPD health expert Drechsler said on ARD television that going by the
advance talks there was a chance for agreement. The Association of
Registered Physicians had threatened with a so-called emergency programme
where physicians would introduce waiting lists for certain medicaments to
stay within the budget. Both Health Minister Fischer and the insurers
rejected this emergency programme. As a compromise the insurers suggested
to halve the sales tax on medicaments. The physicians demanded that
patients pay a part of high treatment costs. They wanted Ms. Fischer to
promise that the physicians would no longer be collectively responsible for
staying within the budget. The budget limits expenditures for medication to
just under 39 billion DM this year. When the physicians prescribe more,
their pay is to be reduced across the board.

New million-mark gap in social insurances?
</H1>
The Federal Employment Ministry has refuted reports of signs of a
new billion-mark hole in the social insurances. The daily Die Welt had
reported that the new 630-DM-job regulation generates significantly less
income for pension and health insurances than planned by the government. By
the end of July only about 1.7 million minimal employment workers have been
registered as contributors. The government, however, is said to have
assumed there would be 3.2 million new contributors this year. Thus,
projected additional revenue of 3.4 million DM for health and pension
insurance were questionable.

No more shopping on Sundays in Halle
</H1>
Next Sunday shops in Halle must remain closed. Today, the Higher
Regional Court of Saxony-Anhalt forbade any sales on Sundays, thus
overruling last week's decision of the Halle Administrative Court that made
exceptions for five dealers. The judges clearly admonished the abuse of
exception clauses of the shopping-hours law in Halle, Leipzig, and Berlin.
The unions covering retail workers, DAG and HBV, were outraged at plans by
the Social-Democrats to extend shopping hours. Meanwhile, the Berlin
Department for Employment Safety announced that it would take stronger
measures against unauthorized Sunday shopping and levy the profit.

Injunction against Yello advertisements
</H1>
The Cologne Regional Court has stopped power utility Energie
Baden-Wuerttemberg (EnBW) and its daughter Yello-Strom from using
aggressive advertizing. In an injunction the court prohibited the statement
that Yello was offering electricity at a price-performance ratio that would
stand any serious scrutiny. The Regional Court thus supported the claimant,
Cologne utility GEW who accused EnBW and Yello-Strom of misleading
advertising. Further, GEW wants to prevent its competitor from using the
GEW network because Yello wants to pipe foreign power through the network.
