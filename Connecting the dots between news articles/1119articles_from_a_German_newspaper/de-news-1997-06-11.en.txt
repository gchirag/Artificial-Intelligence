Euro-dollar to be delayed one year?
</H1>
The federal government is apparently considering delaying the
introduction of the unified European currency, the euro, by one year.
According to a news report, the green light for monetary union is only
supposed to come in the year 2000. Nevertheless, the changeover to the new
currency is still supposed to be completed by 2002. Hence, the schedule
would be shortened from 3 years to 2. Within Germany's governing coalition,
it is being said that it would be better to stop the countdown for a year
than to start with a weak currency. The suggestion must not be made by
Germany, some say, however, but rather by another European partner, such as
France.

Still no breakthrough in budget stand-off
</H1>
The coalition continues to grapple for a way out of the current
budget crisis today. The problem is how to fill a gap in the tens of
billions of Marks over this year and next. A round of talks between leading
member of the CDU/CSU and the FDP this morning ended without tangible
results. The two parties still disagree on what course to follow; as they
diplomatically put it following today's discussion, they are still in the
middle of negotiations. Even though today's talk, at least the third
episode of tax-related rancour within the coalition, failed to achieve a
settlement, the representatives of both sides in the Bundestag are going to
debate tax reforms in a special sitting, even though, officially at least,
no concrete suggestion is on the table yet.
The SPD called on the government to be honest on the subject of lowering
the Solidarity Supplement, as the promised reduction amounted to DM 7.5
billion, which the country could not afford just now. However, the FDP
rejects any delaying of the reduction.

Government against EU employment programme
</H1>
The Opposition has accused the Government of failure in the fight
against unemployment during a Bundestag debate on European policies. SPD
representative Wieczorek-Zeul said her party would not vote in favour of
the new EU treaty without a set of common European employment policies.
Foreign Minister Kinkel had earlier, in an official government statement,
rejected delaying the introduction of the euro. He also placed conditions
on the Government's approval of a European employment programme. Kinkel
said that EU-wide employment programmes must not come to be; Germany's
government does not want any work programmes which are far removed from its
citizens, and also cannot be financed. Instead, Kinkel wants individual
national programmes to be better coordinated than heretofore; if that were
to be the case, his government could approve a chapter on employment in the
EU treaty. In his speech, Kinkel said that Germany and France were rowing
in the same direction as far as Europe was concerned, the new French
government was staying the course, and the success of the EU summit
depended, as so often, on Germany and France not breaking ranks. He added
that if any problems did arise at the summit, the federal government would
clear them up at the future German-French summit in Poitier. Speaking in
the direction of the SPD, Kinkel warned against criticizing monetary union,
saying that whoever came out in favour of delaying it was hurting Germany.

CDU economic committee demands savings
</H1>
The economic committee of the CDU has demanded that less money be
spent on the unemployed, pensioners, and public employees. The chairman of
the organization, Muhrmann (sp?), said that the goal of lowering the
state's financial activity to 46 percent of GDP by the year 2000 must be
adhered to despite lower-than-expected tax revenues. He rejected the idea
of tax hikes, saying it was unacceptable to advance only the 'taking'
provisions of the planned tax reform to 1998. Meanwhile, tax reform talks
within the governing coalition have ended without agreement.

Herzog criticizes too-high tax burden
</H1>
Federal President Herzog has criticized federal, state, and local
levels of government for taking a much too large share of Germans'
earnings. He told the Ludwig Erhardt Foundation that when the government
takes more than half of the country's GDP, it has clearly gone beyond
bearable levels. The president called for companies to be given more
freedom so that they could innovate.

months before the start of the new training year, authorities say there are
still almost 23,000 young people across the country looking for a position.

Trades, and economic committee reject tax increases
</H1>
The central association of German trades, as well as the CDU's own
economic committee flatly reject tax increases as a means of filling
budgetary gaps, supporting the position of the FDP, and rejecting
suggestions from the CDU/CSU that the 'burdensome' provisions of the great
tax reform be implemented ahead of schedule, next year. The opponents of
that suggestion say that if the tax increases are implemented early, then
the tax breaks must be as well. They are also calling for continued savings
measures, especially in the area of social services. The trades association
supports the early sale of federal Telekom shares. It is calling on the SPD
not to block the estimated DM 12 billion in savings any longer in the
Bundesrat. The trades are also distancing themselves from the lowering of
secondary wage costs through an eco-tax, as the SPD is demanding. As to the
euro, they have adopted the chancellor's position: it must come on
schedule, or it will never come.

Cellular phones and laptop computers to be banned on planes
</H1>
The use of cellular phones and laptop computers in airplanes is to be
legally banned. The federal cabinet approved a bill which would punish
offences with up to 2 years' imprisonment. The use of the devices is
already banned, as they can interfere with the on-board electronics of
aircraft; however, there has been no threat of legal consequences until now.

Judgement in Lucona trial
</H1>
Businessman Hans-Peter Daimler has been sentenced to 14 years'
imprisonment in the Lucona trial, following almost 5 years of hearing
evidence. The judgement from the Regional Court in Kiel reads that the
62-year-old is guilty of six counts of being an accessory to murder and of
attempted murder; Daimler and his Viennese friend Udo Proksch are
responsible for the sinking of the Dutch freighter Lucona 20 years ago. In
that sinking, 6 of the 12-member crew died. The court also found Daimler
guilty of attempted insurance fraud; he and Proksch had falsely declared
the cargo to be uranium, and had insured it for about DM 33 million.

No immediate cuts in local passenger service at the railway
</H1>
Germany will help expand local passenger service on the rails with
over DM 22 billion between 1998 and 2003. Federal and state transportation
ministers came to this agreement at a conference in Munich. With the
agreement, talk of the German Railway abandoning large numbers of
uneconomical lines has been ended. Plans to that effect had come to light
in recent weeks. The transportation ministers wanted to have all the facts,
and had asked departing railway boss, Hans Duerr, and his July 1
replacement, Johannes Ludewig, to meet with them. Following the meetings,
the chairman of the transportation ministers' conference, Peter Fischer of
Lower Saxony, said that the ministers had been happy to hear from the
executive chairman of the German Railway Co. that no mass programme to
eliminate lines was intended. Rather, the railway would continue to shut
down only a few lines on which fewer than 10 trains a day ran and for which
the usual assessment procedure included at look at economicalness.

assistance was 27 months. Single women depended on social assistance or the
