Coalition-talks in Hamburg
</H1>
SPD and the Greens parties reached wide agreement in their
coalition-talks, as far as education and business were concerned. As
spokes-person Ms Radtke of the Greens stated after eight hours of
negotiations, children will have to go to Primary School for six years now,
instead of the current four years. Additional teachers will work as
employees, rather than public servants, and they will get 75% of a full-time
job/pay each. Teacher-training is also to get less theoretical, and there
are to be three test-sites for full-time schooling (will last all day).
Small and medium-sized businesses are to be encouraged as well as women
entrepreneurs wanting to set up shop. The decision on extending an Airbus
factory (to the detriment of an existing natural reserve), was postponed.

Debate on less-than-part-time jobs still going strong
</H1>
The employees' lobby-group within the governing parties came up with a novel
idea how to reduce the spread of so-called 610-mark jobs: the threshold
should be lowered to 350 marks/month. This would not penalise genuine
occasional work, whereas real part-time should be treated and taxed as such.
Mr Westerwelle, of the FDP, however, was totally against. He stated that
especially medium-sized companies relied on the existing setup during
bottlenecks

Big wire-tap possibly off
</H1>
According to the tabloid BILD, the draft-law is unlikely to get the required
2/3-majority in the Upper House (Bundesrat). Rhineland/Palatinate, a
state governed by a social-liberal coalition, will only vote for it after
some changes: electronic bugging of priests, lawyers and journalists,
amongst others, should not get legalised.

Fees for directory services in the gun
</H1>
SPD and CDU politicians asked German Telekom to have a re-think on their
price-hikes for directory services. The SPD proposed to give subscribers a
2 mark credit on the rental-fee. Paying for directory services was
fundamentally wrong, and railways as well as shops would provide a similar
service for free. CDU-politician Meister said it would be strange if on
the one hand you spent millions of marks on marketing, and on the other
hand tried to raise everybody's hackles by charging too much. CEO Sommer
said the would not lower prices, but announced improvements for directory
services.

Mr Julius Hackethal dead
</H1>
According to staff at his clinic, the 75-year old contentious
cancer-scientist and surgeon Julius Hackethal died, of lung-cancer.
Mr Hackethal had hit the headlines in the 60s when he criticised colleagues
and accused them of malpractice. Later on he set up a private clinic near
Lake Chiemsee and developed alternative methods for treating cancer. His
methods, however, had never gained acceptance by traditional medical
specialists. In 1984 he caused a debate on euthanasia, providing access to
cyanide for a terminally ill patient who intended to commit suicide.

Driver in wrong lane causes accident
</H1>
One person died and two suffered severe injuries in a frontal collision of
two cars on the Munich-Garmisch autobahn. One of the two drivers had entered
the autobahn at Penzberg using the off-ramp and kept speeding towards Munich
in the wrong lane. Rescue services had to free both drivers from the wrecks.
As both cars were tossed around after the collision, so far no-one knows who
had actually driven in the wrong lane.
