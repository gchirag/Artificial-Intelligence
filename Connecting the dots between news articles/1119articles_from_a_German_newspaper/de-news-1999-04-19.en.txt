Merger of German Telecom and Telecom Italia possibly tomorrow
</H1>
The merger of German Telecom and Telecom Italia is settled.
German Telecom and Telecom Italia may publicly announce their
merger tomorrow, in a press conference in London, according to
reports from well-informed sources.  The German company will
hold about 60% of the corporation.
Last night both companies had declared they were looking at a
possible merger. German Telecom stocks rose 3.17% in morning
trading in response to the announcement.
German Telecom is already the market leader in Europe, and
combined with the Italians, the new telephone corporation will
be worth about DM 400 billion, employing more than 300,000. According
to the daily "Handelsblatt", the merger will be worked
through a stock swap, a process first practiced by Daimler
Chrysler in an international deal.
This would mean that the raise in funding capital announced for
June might remain untouched. The new stock issue seems to be
destined for the acquisition of additional companies.

</H1>

start of the Industrial Convention.  As proof he pointed to the
reduction in export growth, as well as faltering defense
investments and unsatisfactory private consumption. Henkel
demanded that the tax burden on corporations be reduced to 35%
in one step between now and next January.
