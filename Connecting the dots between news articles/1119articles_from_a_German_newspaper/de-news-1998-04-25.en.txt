Chancellor Kohl appeals to his party to close ranks
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl appealed to his party to get into battle-mode, and also asked
both CDU and CSU parties to close ranks. After their infighting during the
past days, there was a need for peace and quiet now. On his party's state
congress in North-Rhine/Westphalia, Mr Kohl laid into his political
opponents.

<P>
The CSU wants to get out of the trough as far as voters' opinions were
concerned; that's the message this congress wanted to get across, only 1 day
out of the state elections in Saxony/Anhalt. There must be an end to
infighting. Chancellor Kohl, the main speaker at the congress, delivered a
pep-talk to his party asking them to make good use of the remaining five
months 'till the elections to turn around voters. We bet on a victory, not
just getting there. And Mr Kohl dug a bit deeper when referring to his
opponent of the SPD, Mr Gerhard Schroeder. On balance he did miserably as
premier of Lower Saxony, his announcements had remained empty promises.
According to the media he was the shiny knight on the golden sloop, but in
reality he had failed abominably as far as the re-unification of the two
Germanies and the common European currency were concerned. Prior to Mr Kohl,
state leader of the party and federal labour minister Norbert Bluem had
delivered a fiery and trend-setting speech, to the delight of the more than
600 delegates. Red-Green (coalitions) would be dangerous for Germany;
Dusseldorf's example should never be ported to Bonn.  North-Rhine/Westphalia
- capital Dusseldorf - has had a Red-Green coalition government for a while,
with no shortage of ups and downs either.

SPD allegedly puts names to shadow cabinet
</H1>
It's all still speculation, but rumours abound. Who will get which job in
case the SPD wins the elections? Several newspapers claim to be in the know,
though party officials' lips are sealed.

<P>
Don't count your chickens before they are hatched - that's what their leaders
keep repeating these days. The German original comes across a tad more
belligerent: 'Don't share the bear's hide before you've caught
him'. According to the newspaper WELT AM SONNTAG, head of the party Oskar
Lafontaine will get a super-ministry (economics and finance). Mr Scharping
will remain head of the parliamentary group. According to the news magazine
DER SPIEGEL, deputy head of the metal-workers' union Walter Riester will get
the labour ministry, succeeding Norbert Bluem. And Mr Riester allegedly
already has said yes. Mr Schroeder is also to have two women run traditional
ministries, namely the ministry for internal affairs and the ministry of
justice. Even if they have to form a coalition government, the SPD is
hell-bent on getting the ministries for internal affairs, defence, economics
and finance. Today the SPD neither confirmed nor denied any of that, but
someone else did: management consultant Roland Berger, Munich, who allegedly
was short-listed for the ministry of economics, said that he would not serve
as minister under Mr Schroeder. He had his problems with the SPD's manifesto,
and apart from that, he would vote for the CSU in the next elections.

Allegedly Bundesbank makes huge profits
</H1>
Neither the Bundesbank nor the Ministry of Finance want to comment on
an article in the tabloid BILD alleging huge profits of the central bank.
They referred to the bank's meeting on May 14. Allegedly the bank had made a
profit of 23.5 billion marks in 1997, 7 billions of which had been paid into
Mr Waigel's federal consolidated account. The profit was made by a more
up-to-date valuation of dollar reserves the bank holds. So far the central
bankers had been prudent and used an exchange rate of 1.35 marks to the
dollar. Currently one dollar is worth 1.80 marks.

30.000 additional apprenticeships required
</H1>
According to the federal labour office, 30,000 additional
apprenticeships will be needed this year. All have to try even harder to make
sure everyone who's willing and able gets an apprenticeship, according to the
office's boss, Mr Jagoda, in an interview by the Cologne newspaper
EXPRESS. But he thought that this would be achievable.

Police officers' union: life in jail shouldn't be a breeze for criminals
</H1>
The police officers' union asked for more restrictions and better
security for hardened criminals in penitentiaries. Deputy union leader
Freiberg criticised that making life in jail more pleasant would mainly be
done to re-socialise inmates, when interviewed by the newspaper NEUE
OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG. Protecting the general public would be less important.
Mr Freiberg said that this could play into the hands of right-wing radicals.
According to head of the union Lutz, the number of violent and drug offences
in Germany keeps rising. In an interview with the tabloid BILD, he stated
that last year the number of the above offences had risen by 3.9%, to reach
almost 187,000. Leaders of the pack were Saxony-Anhalt and Hamburg with rates
of 10.7 and 10.2%

CCC cracks the code for the D2 cellular phone card
</H1>
Members of the infamous Chaos-Computer-Club (CCC) have cracked the
code for the telephone card of Mannesmann Mobilfunk (a cellular phone
company), according to a report by DER SPIEGEL. They were able to access
secret data due to inadequate encryption codes. They were able to copy the
cards for the D2 network and make telephone calls on other customers' bills.
D2-Mannesmann confirmed that their telephone cards could theoretically be
copied; they claimed, however, that the risk of damage is about the same as a
cellular phone card and the password being stolen at the same time.
