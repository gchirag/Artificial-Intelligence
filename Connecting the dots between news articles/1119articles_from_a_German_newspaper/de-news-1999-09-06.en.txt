Only two-parties Sarre state parliament
</H1>
The SPD lost 5% since the last state election, getting 44.4% of the
vote.  The CDU gained almost 7%, and has 45.5% of the vote, which
resulted in a change of government.  Peter "young savage" Mueller, the
CDU challenger, came out the victor, having promised 60,000 new jobs,
and economic support for the middle and working classes.  Another
factor in the CDU's favor was Saarland's uncharacteristically low
voter turnout of only about 70%.

<P>
The SPD couldn't mobilize its core constituency and there alone lost
more than 5% of the vote.

<P>
Tears and long faces characterized the Greens, who were voted out
completely.  The Greens, like some parts of the SPD, blame this on
federal politics.  The Liberals also did not make it in, but still
have cause to celebrate.  Though they won no seat in the state
parliament, but a change of government has come about.  Thus, only 2
parties will be represented in Saarland's parliament, with the CDU
possessing just one seat more than the SPD.

Stolpe wants to begin discussions w/ CDU and PDS
</H1>
The SPD in Brandenburg lost almost 15% of the vote, and with it the
absolute majority; ending up with 39.3% of the electoral votes.  The
CDU gained almost 8%, receiving 26.6%.  Gains were also reported by
PDS, now at 23.3% In Brandenburg's new Parliament, the Social
Democrats will have to find a coalition partner. According to premier
Manfred Stolpe, they will sound out both the CDU and the PDS.  Stolpe
said he refuses to lead a tolerated minority government, as the loss
of votes was too steep.  Early  analysis indicates that the SPD lost
more than 30,000 votes to the CDU and more than 40,000 to the PDS.
Representatives of all parties expressed their dismay over the
right-extremist party DVU's gaining entrance into parliament.  Stolpe
called this a personal defeat.  The SPD also lost a few direct
mandates, one of them in the very state capital of Potsdam, where the
PDS's top candidate and party leader Lothar Bisky replaced the
incumbent SPD candidate.

SPD lost because core constituents stayed away
</H1>
Initial analysis tends to show that the SPD's losses in both Sarre
state and Brandenburg may be attributed to the voting behavior of core
constituents.  In Sarre, the SPD's losses were especially high in
large cities, lower income residential areas, and among low
wage-earners, according to Infratest.  calculations A decisive factor
for the defeat was the disappointment core constituents felt about
red-green politics on the federal level, which made them stay at home
in droves.  The CDU won whereever the SPD lost. The union has again
turned attractive for younger Sarre voters.

<P>
The SPD's Brandenburg debacle was due to a voter shift of 19% of their
former constituents, who changed over to either CDU, PDS, or even the
extreme right-wing DVU. Many habitual SPD voters just staid away.
The SPD reaped  tow figure losses in lower income and in rural areas.
Right-wing DVU gained votes from SPD among blue collar workers
and unemployed persons.

Schroeder holds on to economy package, CDU wants adjustments
</H1>
Federal Chancellor Schroeder wants to keep the federal government
locked into the economy package despite the SPD's electoral losses.
The SPD boss said last night that there was no reason to deviate from
the "plan for the future".  The program was necessary, accurate, and
would therefore be carried through.  The CDU left clear after their
victories that they want to make use of their increased strength in
the Bundesrat [second chamber] introduce important changes into the
program.  Saarbruecken's premier designate Mueller, called the plans
unacceptable, because they passed on the costs to the states.  In
particular, he called on the governing coalition to abandon their
plans for changes in retirement pay.

Muentefering nominated unanimously for SPD General Secretary
</H1>
Franz Muentefering will be the SPD's General Secretary, after being
unanimously nominated to the post by the SPD council.  "The country is
doing well; the SPD is not doing so well at the moment.  I want to
contribute toward making both the country and the SPD do well again.
And so I confidently enter into this new task," said Muentefering,
former Transportation Minister.  Until the party convention in
December, M Muentefering will take over from Ottmar Schreiner as
acting federal general manager of the party.  Schreiner announced his
resignation as expected.  There are no indications at this time on who
will becomve Transportation Minister, though the best chances are
being given to state secretary of the Economics Ministry Mossdorf.

German tradesmen and artisans expect record levels of illicit work
</H1>
Illicit work will increase sharply this year, according to estimates
made by German tradesmen's associations.  The President of the Central
Association of German Tradesmen, Phillip, said in a newpaper interview
that he fears a record level. 100 billion Deutsch Marks have
reportedly been lost by legally established tradesmen and artisans. To
counteract this trend, Phillip proposed making illicit work a criminal
offense.  [Translator's note: Under German usage, tradesmen's and
artisans' services, such as home repairs, for instance, may only be
carried out by trained, licensed and established persons.]
