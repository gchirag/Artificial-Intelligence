CDU and CSU deny receiving French bribes
</H1>
The CDU has strongly denied reports which claim that the party
took bribes from the French oil company 'Elf'. Hintze, the CDU's
general secretary, said that the party has never received money from
any French source. According to a report in a French newspaper, the
oil multinational Elf paid out DM 13.5 million during its take-over of
the East German company Minol, and part of this went to the CDU.
Hintze maintains that no part of the CDU - neither the federal party
nor the regional organisation - has received any support either
directly or indirectly from France or from Elf; the CDU has certainly
not accepted money in this way through its sister-party, the CSU. The
CSU also issued a denial from its headquarters in Munich. Hintze said
that it was outrageous that such a monstrous allegation should be
brought up to discredit the Franco-German relationship during the
French elections. He continued, saying that the CDU officially
received a total of DM 38 million in donations during 1992, so it
would hardly be possible to hide a bribe of DM 13 million; if a
donation of above DM 20,000 is accepted, the donor's identity must be
revealed.

Iran forbids German ambassador's return
</H1>
The Iranian religious leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, has decided
that the German ambassador will not be allowed to return to his post
at present. Khamenei announced this at a rally, saying that other
ambassadors could return if they wanted to. Welajati, the Iranian
foreign minister, told journalists in Tehran "we will not welcome the
return of certain ambassadors", naming Germany and Denmark in
particular. The ambassadors had been recalled in mid-April as a result
of the 'Mykonos' trial in Berlin, but EU foreign ministers decided
yesterday that they should return to Iran. Iran's declaration provoked
mixed reactions in Bonn. Schmuelling, a government spokesman, said
that the government had been surprised by Iran's decision, but added
that the reports were still unconfirmed. Heuer, a secretary of state
at the foreign office, said that Germany should not overreact, he was
sure that the other countries of Europe would stand with Germany if
Iran's threat should turn out to be seriously meant. Vogt (SPD) said
that Iran's behaviour was a slap in the face for the foreign ministers
of the EU; their decision to send their ambassadors back to Iran had
been taken too quickly and had been seen as a sign of weakness.
Joschka Fischer, the leader of the parliamentary party of the Greens
called for Foreign Minister Kinkel to resign.

Foreign Minister Kinkel on state visit to Romania
</H1>
Foreign minister Klaus Kinkel has arrived in the Romanian
capital at the start of an official visit to the country which will
last for two days. As he was welcomed by the Romanian foreign
minister, Severin, Kinkel said that he expected that Romania would be
accepted as a member of NATO and the EU in the near future; the
country had made enormous economic and political progress. He
continued, saying that Germany knew from its own experience how
difficult such a transitional period could be. The Romanian government
is hoping that Kinkel will make a clear statement on Germany's
position as to Romania's chances of being admitted to NATO in the
first wave of expansion. Kinkel is in Romania to celebrate the fifth
anniversary of the signing of the German-Romanian friendship treaty.

arrested on Monday and Kremp said that the police had taken his
passport away from him, along with other documents. The police had

Poisonous gas accident in Baar due to human error
</H1>
The accident involving poisonous gases which occurred yesterday
at a foundry in Baar in Swabia in which three people were injured was
apparently caused by human error. Workers at the plant had washed
chrome and not steel, as should have been the case, in a container
using acid. This caused a chemical reaction and the resulting
compounds overflowed out of the container and a cloud of poisonous gas
was released. Around 50 litres of the acid escaped into the river Baar
through the sewage system, killing the fish in the river.

Agreement reached in VW pay talks
</H1>
The Volkswagen company will create 400 new temporary jobs at
its plant in Emden. The company, Europe's biggest car-manufacturer,
gave this promise during the talks on pay and conditions for VW
workers in western Germany. In return for this, the trade union

workers 10 per cent less than other workers for the company. Both
sides in the talks announced that the monthly gross salary for a
temporary worker will be around DM 400 less than those paid on the

Walpurgisnacht celebrations in Harz mountains
</H1>
The celebrations for Walpurgisnacht have begun in several
towns. There have been colourful street parties and nostalgic parades
where people, mostly dressed up as witches, devils and ghosts, paraded
through the streets to open air dancing places where they will play
out typical Walpurgisnacht games, awaiting the arrival of devils and
witches from all over Europe, following the story of an old Germanic
saga. Every year in the Harz Mountains, thousands welcome in the
spring in this way on Walpurgisnacht, the night before 1st May.
