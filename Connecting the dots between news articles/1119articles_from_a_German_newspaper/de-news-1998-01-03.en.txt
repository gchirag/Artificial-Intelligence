Telecommunications regulatory agency invites to round table talks
</H1>
The regulatory agency that oversees the nascent competition on Germany's
telecommunications market has invited to round table talks to solve pending
disputes over fees.  Germany's former telecommunications monopolist, Telekom,
had previously announced to impose fees on customers who want to choose an
alternate long distance carrier, and other fees if they want to keep their
old phone number.  An agency spokesman confirmed that all concerned parties
would indeed be invited.  A consumer association for postal and
telecommunications services opined that the regulatory council should
anything but approve the plans to charge for keeping an existing phone number
when switching to a competitor.  In an interview with Saarlaendischer
Rundfunk radio the association's president, Mr. Huebner, referred to an
ordinance which grants the customer, not Telekom, ownership of a phone
number.  Therefore, the proposed fees lack legal grounds.  Mr. Huebner blamed
Telekom for having missed the rise of competition and now trying to
intimidate customers.

Union of public employees demands raise of 3.5 percent
</H1>
The union for public employees that hold lifetime appointments has stated
that their negotiating objective for the upcoming collective bargaining
session will be a linear increase of 3.5 percent.  When combined with the
also proposed cuts in work hours and old-age part time arrangements, the
total package equals a raise of 4.5 percent, union chairman Mr. Geier said in
an interview with "Der Spiegel".  This agrees with the positions of the other
public servant unions, OeTV and DAG.  In Mr. Geier's opinion, austerity has
reigned long enough in the public sector, and real wage increases are due
now.  This would also boost the domestic economy, he said.  The collective
bargaining round for the public sector's 3.2 million employees is coming up
on January 15.

Zwickel: No change on the job market in 1998
</H1>
 The chairman of IG Metall [union for metal & heavy industry],
Mr. Zwickel, doesn't anticipate a turnaround of the job market for 1998.  In
an interview with the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag" he said at most a temporary
improvement could be expected.  For the turn of the century, he even
forecasts worse conditions than today.  Plans to slash another 200,000 jobs
are circulating in the automobile industry.  Mr. Zwickel cautioned against a
large-scale substitution of the traditional industry-wide wage agreements for
company-specific solutions.  His union has ruled out to join forces with the
federal government, because the government had long ago suspended all efforts
in this domain, he concluded.

CDA: Employers able to create millions of new jobs
</H1>
 In the eyes of the Christian-Democratic workers' association (CDA),
employers should be in a position to easily create one million socially
secured jobs, without overburdening companies.  In an interview, the
association's president, Mr. Ahrens, pointed the finger at parts of the
industry for blocking the strong increase in payroll that is now possible.
Mr. Ahrens also demanded a reduction of overtime, more part-time jobs, and a
conversion of certain part-time employments ("610 DM jobs") into permanent
employments.

CDU: Gas price of 5 DM/liter problematic
</H1>
CDU financial expert Mr. Uldahl views a hike in gas prices to 5 marks a liter
as problematic.  He was taken by surprise, he said Deutschlandradio Berlin,
when the chairman of German Shell AG, Mr. Laufs, made exactly such a
proposition.  Mr. Uldahl opined that consequences would be catastrophic if a
red-green government were to implement a gas price this high.  The costs for
delivery and shopping runs would multiply.  The automobile industry would be
hard hit.  Mr. Uldahl also warned against the misconception that introduction
of an ecological tax would drive down the general tax burden.

Genscher backs comments criticizing FDP
</H1>
Honorary FDP head Mr. Genscher has raised his voice in FDP internal quarrels
about the party's course.  Endorsing criticism by former Minister of Justice
Ms. Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger, the ex-Foreign Minister has called for a
broader profile of the FDP.  In an interview with "Der Spiegel" Mr. Genscher
underlined the importance of addressing all centerpieces of liberal identity
with equal vigor, not just the tax reform.  He mentioned educational policy
as a positive example which had been efficiently represented by the head of
the FDP in North Rhine-Westphalia, Mr. Moellemann, who also counts among the
critics.  Party head Gerhard, on the other hand, warned that criticism from
the home front threatens the existence of the Liberal Democrats.  Mr. Gerhard
said in an interview with "Focus" that careless talk has a negative influence
on the outcome of the nearing elections.
