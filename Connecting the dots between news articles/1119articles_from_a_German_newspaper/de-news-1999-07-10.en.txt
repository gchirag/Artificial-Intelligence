DGB makes suggestions for pension reform
</H1>
The red-green federal government is once again discussing pension reform.
The German Federation of Unions (DGB) has asked the CDU and CSU to
collaborate on a reform plan.  Deputy DGB Chair Ursula Engelen-Kefer
suggests that the pensions should continue grow in proportion with
take-home pay but that family benefits should increase at a slower rate.
She said that retired people have no children to feed and shouldn't profit
from increased state benefits for families and children. This was the
reasoning behind her plan, which should to keep personal pension
contributions basically stable.  But if retirement income were no longer
linked to take-home pay, there would be a justified fear that retired
people might eventually have their needs pushed to the side and
overlooked.

<P>
The last scenario is not an option for the DGB vice-chairperson. In an
interview with the "Neu Osnabruecker Zeitung," Engelen-Kefer stated that
the rise in the inflation rate predicted by Labor Minister Riester would
reduce the buying power of pensions by roughly 1% next year. For the DGB,
this is a significant reduction in pensions and not acceptable. Before the
pension plan ends up before the Federal Constitutional Court, pension
adjustments should continue to be linked to take-home pay for the next few
years.  However, the increases should be significantly reduced by rise in
child benefits and applying the accumulated fund set aside for that
purpose. Her suggestion could give a new impetus to the discussion on
pension reform.

<P>
Koch, minister president of the CDU, stressed that his party would be
prepared to join in on the pension reform dialogue as soon as the federal
government gives up the idea of letting pensions grow at the rate of
inflation for the next two years.  Federal Chancellor Schroeder announced
that he wants to schedule meetings with all parties and groups to discuss
the pension issue after the summer hiatus.

Bavarian Greens leader calls for party unity
</H1>
Federal foreign minister Joschka Fischer has become active in the nuclear
energy debate. He met yesterday with leaders of major power companies.
According to the Ministry of the Environment, the meeting was agreed to by
both Fischer and Juergin Trittin, the Minister under whose responsibility
nuclear power falls.  Fischer must clear find some way of compromising.
The power companies and numerous politicians accuse Trittin of being
unwilling to compromise on the nuclear phase-out process. Fischer's plan
met with wide acceptance at the Greens' state party congress in Lindau.
At the start of the meeting, Margarete Bause, chair of the Bavarian
Greens, called for her party to show more commitment to and unity with the
government. The state head of the Greens told members they had to get into
the streets if they wanted to put wind in the sails of energy policies.
That was the only way to achieve a real nuclear phase-out.

<P>
Federal chair Antje Radcke was against making too many compromises. After
she welcomed the participation of Foreign Minister Fischer in the latest
round of talks with the nuclear power industry, she warned the
approximately 250 delegates against always wanting to make environmental
policy strictly through consensus.

The traditional meeting in Germany of Silesian farmers began in Nuremberg
this morning. The two-day event has the motto, "Acknowledging Silesia: 50
years of Silesian Agriculture." The meeting takes place every two years.
Event organizers expected up to 100,000 visitors. Herbert Hupka, chair of
the Silesian farmers' organization, spoke of a very productive
German-Polish dialogue between the farmers group and official
representatives of the Polish government. He said there have been great
successes in Silesia the past decade.  Nonetheless, there are still
problems. German is allowed but there are not enough German-speaking
teachers. In addition, Hupka pressed the desirability of bilingual street
signs in Silesia. In addition, those Silesians driven from their homes
demand a right of residence and an investigation of disputed property
issues. Poland's accession to the EU will also bring new solutions, Mr.
Hupka added.
