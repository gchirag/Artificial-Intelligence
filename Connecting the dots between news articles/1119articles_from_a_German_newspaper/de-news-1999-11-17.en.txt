</H1>
The negotiations over compensation for those forced into slave labour under
the Nazis have been adjourned in Bonn with no visible results. The

Federal Cabinet lowers pension premiums
</H1>
The premium rates for public old-age security will fall to 19.3% next year.
The federal cabinet today approved a pension report presented by Labour
Minister Walter Riester, which contains that provision. In 1998, the rate
was 20.3%. According to the labour ministry, the change will mean that
people with average incomes will keep an extra 272 DMarks per year. In the
following years, until 2003, the rates will continue to sink, subsequently
stabilizing at about 19%. The loss in federal revenue accompanying the rate
drop is to be made up for through increased revenue from the eco-tax.

Former Compuserve boss Somm acquitted
</H1>
In a pilot trial concerning pornography on the internet, former Compuserve
boss Felix Somm has, on appeal, been acquitted by the Regional Court in
Munich. In 1998 the District Court in Munich sentenced Somm to 2 years'
imprisonment and a 100,000 DM fine - as an accomplice in the distribution of
child and animal pornography on the internet. The central argument in Somm's
appeal of the sentence was the question of whether an internet service
provider can prevent access to illegal files. Experts testified that they
could not.

Public Service and Union Federation bosses want Verdi super-union
</H1>
The boss of the Public Service and Transportation Union (OeTV), Herbert Mai,
and that of the National Trade Union Federation (DGB), Dieter Schulte,
speaking at the OeTV special congress in Dortmund, have encouraged support
for the planned super-union called Verdi. The Unified Service Union
("vereinte Dienstleistungsgewerkschaft" - Verdi) is the best chance to give
the trade union movement a future, according to Mai; with over 3 million
members, it would be a powerful organization. Besides the OeTV and DGB, the
following unions would also like to join the super-union: Trade, Banking,
and Insurance (HBV); Media (IG Medien); the National Union of Employees
(DAG); and the German Postal Union (DPG). These other unions will hold their
congresses beginning on Thursday. The discussions are scheduled to finish by
weekend.

Railway apartments will be sold after all
</H1>
After a long dispute, the 114,000 federally-owned apartments previously
reserved for railway employees may now be sold. An arbitration committee in
Frankfurt made the decision today. The staff council of the Federal Railway
Asset holding company [established to manage former railway properties and
goods which the federal administration retained when the railway was
privatized], the German Renters' Association (deutscher Mieterbund), and the
Railway Union (GdED) opposed the sale. In March, the federal government
decided to sell the apartments to private interests. Two parties have
offered 7.1 and 8.1 billion DMarks, respectively. Today's decision
guarantees the railway employees living in the apartments the life-long
right to continue renting their apartments, and moderate rental increases.
