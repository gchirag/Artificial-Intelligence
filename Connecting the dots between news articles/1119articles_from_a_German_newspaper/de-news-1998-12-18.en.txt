Bonn reactions to Iraq strikes
</H1>
All parties represented in the Bundestag with the exception of PDS
came out in favor of the US/British military action. The gist of all
comments was that Saddam Hussein bears sole responsibility.
Foreign minister Fischer hopes for an early cease-fire. He said,
"We hope that this military action will soon come to an end and
politics can reassume its rightful place to achieve a durable and
peaceful solution to the benefit of Iraq's population."

Doctors protest against economy plans
</H1>
There were physicians' protest marches against a possible reduction
of ambulant medical treatment in several Bavarian cities today.
Emergency services were set up in strike-bound clinics in
Wuerzburg, Nuernberg and Munich. Doctors are being criticized
by many who see the fear of diminishing income at the root of
the protest action. The Medical Association refutes this. The protest
is in favor of patients, says MA chairman Wittek.

Bundesrat discusses proposed law drafts
</H1>
Finance minister Lafontaine defended his tax reform plan before the
Bundesrat (upper chamber). After years of a supply oriented policy
favoring business, it was now the time for bolstering demand, he said.
This was the only way to give impulse to employment and the overall
economy. The Bundesrat approved two laws today: one lowering the
initial income tax level, the other increasing child subsidies. Most
of the innovations will be implemented by January. Child subsidy will
iuncrease by DM 30 to DM 250 per month. The new initial income tax
level will be 23.9%. Sick pay is back to 100%. Bavaria's premier
Stoiber, who had earlier attacked the red/green plans, reiterated his
attacks in the Bundesrat. "The federal government cannot promise
benefits  like increased child subsidies and lower tax levels if it does
not pay for them out of its own pocket. And this is a federal matter".
The main tax reform legislation is to be voted in March with retroactive
effect.

Bavarian police practise group discrimination
</H1>
Data protection commissioner Vetter presented a report today which
shows up massive instances of violation. It states, among other items,
that punks or skinheads are often submitted to criminal identification
without giving cause. Bavaria-wide criminal records contain many
facts about persons for too long a time stretch and without justification.
Also, the 350 page report chides police for their treatment of
Sinti and Roma. Their license plates are stored in police data banks
quasi preventively,without justifiable cause.
