Lafontaine: SPD and CDU positions regarding pension insurance similar
</H1>
In the opinion of the Chairman of the Social Democratic Party (SPD),
Oscar Lafontaine, the proposals made by both the Social Democrats and the
Christian Democratic Party regrading pension insurance reform are
relatively similar. On the ZDF TV station, Mr. Lafontaine attributed the
breakdown in negotiations to differences of opinion within the governing
coalition itself. He continued that he is uncertain whether Chancellor
Kohl has enough standing to be able to reach an agreement with the SPD
without the Free Democratic Party. The Chairman of the SPD is advocating
a gradual sales tax increase to compensate for lowering pension
contributions, but he did not give exact numbers. Mr. Beck, the State
Premier of Rhineland-Palatinate, had proposed an increase in sales tax by
three percent by the year 1999.

New record unemployment rate in January?
</H1>
The coming year might start off with renewed record unemployment
highs. Economic experts fear that five million people could be without
employment. Professor Pfeffighoven told the weekly paper "Bild am
Sonntag" that this number might be even higher if the weather is
unusually cold in January and February. He said that an important reason
for this record high is the fact that tax reform failed to materialize
and that investment in the German economy continue to be weak.

<P>
German Minister of Economy Rexrodt of the FDP also does not rule out the
possibility that the jobless figures could rise to five million next
year. Mr. Rexrodt told the Berlin-Brandenburg radio station "Inforadio"
that he does not expect to make significant progress in reducing
unemployment in 1998. However, he said that he is of the opinion that the
turning point has been reached.
