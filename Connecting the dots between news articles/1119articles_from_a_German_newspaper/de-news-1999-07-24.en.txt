Eichel to continue austerity course
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Eichel's plan to save DM 30 billion in the current
budget already send a wave of jitters around the country.  Now Eichel seeks
to cut the budget even further.  He told "Bild am Sonntag" that the 30
billion package is only the beginning of his strategy to balance the budget
within a few years.  In his opinion, it is insufficient to just reduce new
debt to less than 50 billion marks a year.  Eichel aims at driving the new
debt down to zero.  Given a robust economy and some budgetary cut-backs,
this should be possible in eight years, Eichel said.

Germany's most wanted criminal has resurfaced
</H1>
One of Germany's most wanted criminals has reappeared.  He is fitfty-seven
year-old Dieter Zuwehme.  His latest act of violence was the attempt to
rape a girl in the Lower-Saxon town of Stadthagen.  This was concluded from
blood stains found on the hand-cuffs Zuwehme had used to tie up his victim.
 The 15-year old girl, however, fought back and escaped.  Last winter,
Zuwehme broke out of a penitentiary in North Rhine-Westphalia. He was
serving a sentence for murder and several sexual assaults.  In March of
this year he is suspected of ftally stabbing two elderly couples. During
the ongoing search for Zuwehme, the police have made several serious
mistakes.  In late June, for example, agents shot a tourist because they
had mistaken him for Zuwehme.  The police believes the notorious killer's
current location is somewhere in the area between Bielefeld and Hanover.

bomb warning was not sounded.  The black bag with a cable protruding from
it which was attached to a bike stand was discovered by the Munich police.
