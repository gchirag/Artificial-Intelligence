Floods spread to Brandenburg
</H1>
The floods on the River Oder are now also threatening Brandenburg.
According to the Ministry for the Environment, the areas most at risk are
the region around Eisenhuettenstadt and the Oder marshes.  In Frankfurt
the crisis committee is expecting river levels to reach a new high of 6.50
meters around tomorrow lunchtime.  That would be 15 cm higher than the
floods of 1930, the highest so far this century.  Evacuations are at
present not planned, since most districts lie above the level of the
expected flood.  In Ratzdorf at the confluence of the Rivers Oder and
Neisse near the Polish border, the first dike has already been breached.
Relief workers struggled in vain to raise the level of the dike with
sandbags.  A level 4 flood alert has been issued for the Oder/Spree
district.  The River Oder has risen almost 50 cm since this morning.

EU-internal borders.  Germany, however, had expressed concerns about the
security implications of such a step.

Travel agent deceives customers
</H1>
A travel agent has deceived hundreds of holiday-makers.  The firm
Travelservice specialized in budget long distance trips and other cheap
travel offers.  The catch with the cheap offers was that they always had
to be paid for in advance.  It seems that in many cases the proceeds were
insufficient for the travel agency to pay the tour operators.  Many
customers paid, without ever receiving their travel documents.
