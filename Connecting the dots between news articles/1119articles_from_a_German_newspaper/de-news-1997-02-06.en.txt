DGB views in unemployment figures proof of failure of government policy
</H1>
In face of roughly 4.7 million jobless people, the political dispute about
solutions has grown more violent.  The German Trade Union Federation (DGB) has
demanded immediate measures to increase the employment rate.  The DGB
considers the latest figures as ultimate proof of a failed economic policy of
the government.  DGB vice chair, Ms. Ursula Engelen-Kefer, said now we have to
pay the bill for reduction of social welfare, restrictions on lay-off
protection and slashing bad weather compensation for construction workers.  In
the opinion of the DGB, the country is drifting into dangerous currents and
needs a completely novel policy.

Employers oppose renewal of ABM measures
</H1>
In face of the record unemployment, employers in Germany themselves oppose a
renewal of so-called job creation measures (ABM).  It is more important that
the collective bargaining agreements start providing for cheaper labor costs.
In the opinion of the federal umbrella organization of the employers
associations, this would mean to freeze salaries in West Germany for several
years, while in East Germany a reduction of pay is called for.

and supply of apprenticeships is growing wider.  In September, the deficit of

between companies that train apprentices and those that do not.

bargaining parties agreed to extend the hardship provision for East German
companies in difficult economic condition through mid-1998.  The wage
