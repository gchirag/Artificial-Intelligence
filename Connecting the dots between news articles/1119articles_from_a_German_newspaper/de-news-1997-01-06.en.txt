EU parliament accuses Commission of failure in BSE affair
</H1>
The parliament of the European Union has accused the EU Commission of
failure in dealing with the cattle pest BSE ("mad cow disease"). This is
the conclusion of a preliminary report by the EU parliament's BSE inquiry
commission. The report says the EU Commission has taken human health less
seriously than the potential breakdown of the beef market. The dangers of
the cattle pest have been downplayed. The Commission has not used all its
powers to check on abattoirs in Great Britain. The parliamentary report
will be officially presented in February.

Liberals demand reforms for 1997
</H1>
The Liberal FDP wants to press for reforms in various areas this year. This
was announced by high-ranking politicians at the party's Epiphany [6
January] congress in Stuttgart. The reforms concern taxes, and the
education, pensions, and welfare system. Party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt
repeated that his party wants to abolish the solidarity surcharge by the
year 2000. He added the abolishment did not mean a reduction of solidarity
with the new states but the surcharge must not turn into a continuous tax
with a negative image for the German re-unification.

Social Democrats urge EU to take sanctions against Serbia
</H1>
Social Democrats (SPD) have asked the European Union to take economic
sanctions against Belgrade. Milosevic's government has to be isolated, said
SPD foreign affairs spokes-person Karsten Voigt today in Bonn.
Additionally, the German government should, within the European Union,
speak up for the recognition of the results in the Serbian local elections.

<P>
Earlier, German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel had again admonished the
Serbian leadership to acknowledge the election victories of the opposition
alliance Sajetno (sp?). At the traditional Epiphany meeting of the Liberal
Party (FDP) in Stuttgart, Mr Kinkel said those who ignore the vote of the
people will not find the way to Europe.

Juergen Schneider faces up to 15 years of imprisonment
</H1>
Property tycoon Juergen Schneider faces up to 15 years of imprisonment for
the biggest bankruptcy ever in Germany's property sector. In the bill of
indictment published today, the Public Prosecutor's Office charges
Schneider with fraud, credit fraud, bankruptcy and forgery of documents.
The trial against him, his wife and two other defendants will not begin
until summer.

<P>
The Public Prosecutor's Office only looked into a small part of Schneider's
deals. Those investigated, though, are representative of all the frauds
committed by the estate agent, said Public Prosecutor Dieter Heike (sp?).
Mr Schneider is charged with five cases of fraud and one case of fraudulent
bankruptcy with a total value of Dm650 million. The banks seem to be out of
the woods meanwhile - the investigators did not find any leads to any
participation of the banks in the frauds. They were able to show that the
banks made mistakes, but stupidity in itself is not punishable.

<P>
Mr and Mrs Schneider went to earth on Easter 1994 and were tracked down in
Miami, Florida, after a thirteen month search. Juergen Schneider initiated
the biggest bankruptcy in the property sector in post-war Germany. When his
empire went bust, his debts totaled more than six billion marks.

Long delivery times for heating fuel
</H1>
Due to the continuing cold, house and apartment owners must wait up to one
week for heating fuel deliveries. The holidays and intense cold have caused
a high demand for fuel. Mineral oil companies think fuel prices could
increase because many rivers are frozen and the fuel has to be transported
by train or trucks which would force prices up.
