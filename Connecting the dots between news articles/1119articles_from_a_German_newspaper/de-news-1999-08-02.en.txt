New Discussion after salesopen Stores on Sunday
</H1>
The German Retail Trade Association demanded a clear and countrywide agreement
on the opening hours of shops on Sundays. Association secretary-general Wenzel
said in the Deutschlandfunk, the Federal Government had to bring the chaos of
numerous regional exceptional agreements to an end. Wenzel rejected a change for
whole Germany, because this would start a concentration wave, which many smaller
shops would not survive. According to Wenzel, there is no consumers’ need for
additional shopping hours. Curiosity had been the only reason for the rush
yesterday in Berlin, Halle and Dessau, so shop keepers should not calculate
long-term with a higher turnover. But according to the German Association
representing the middle class, the sales action showed that the consumers
consider the law regulating the closing hours of shops as obsolete. All
shop-keepers in Germany should have the possibility to determine the opening
hours of their shops on their own.

Gerhardt demands non-partisan Tax and Pension Summit
</H1>
The Free Democrats suggested a non-partisan tax and pension summit. FDP-Chairman
Gerhardt said in Berlin, that a decision is needed over all political border.
More and more SPD-politicians realize that the future of the country would be at
stake without reforms. Gerhardt also referred to faction leader Struck’s demand
for a radical reform of the wage and income tax. The proposal of a
three-stage-model with taxation rates of 15 %, 25% and 35% corresponds with the
plans of the FDP. The national union of employees rejected Struck’s proposal.
Turning away from the linear-progressive system would nearly be the same as to
give up the accepted fiscal principle. According to that, the taxation depends
on the economical power. The national trade union federation had the same
opinion.

Dewis demands unanimity on internal party-line for the SPD
</H1>
The Thuringian SPD-chairman Dewis (sp?) criticized the discussion on the
party-line of his party. Dewis said on the Deutschlandfunk that all the
discussions are necessary, but not now and not in public. At the moment, some
members of the SPD are trying to set up profile at the expense of the whole
party and especially of the Chancellor. This could only bring a short-term
success to individual federal states, but would damage the whole idea. Dewis
further emphasized, all social democrats should support the Federal Government
to carry out its reform plans. In the future, solidarity and unanimity on an
internal party-line would be the key for the SPD.

Fischer criticizes emergency program
</H1>
Health Minister Fischer harshly criticized the emergency program of doctors
participating in a public health insurance. The minister said in Berlin, that
the way of the discussion frightens the people. Moreover there is no material
reason, because there is considerably more money available for 1999 for medical
treatments than for last year. According to the emergency program, f.e. there
should be waiting lists for not absolutely necessary medicines and emergency
prescriptions, which first had to be paid by the patients themselves.
