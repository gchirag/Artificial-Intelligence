Different taxation of pensions
</H1>
The fiscal court in Muenster wants a decision of the Federal Constitutional
Court, whether normal pensions and pensions of public servants still may be
taxed differently. The court in Muenster assumes that this offends against the
Grundgesetz (Germany's constitution). The judges referred to a decision of the
Federal Constitutional Court of 1980, when the judges requested the legislation
to abolish the different kinds of taxation. According to the financial judges,
four full electoral periods would actually have been sufficient, in order to
regulate this matter. Pensions of public servants are free of tax up to
approximately 60,000 DM, normal pensioners have only a free allowance of
approximately 22,000 DM.
