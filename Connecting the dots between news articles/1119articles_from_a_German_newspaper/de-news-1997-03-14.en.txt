CDU executive approves Bluem's concept for pension reform
</H1>
With a large majority, the executive of the CDU has approved of
Employment Minister Bluem's concept for reforming the pension system. Only
two of the leading politicians in the party objected to the suggested
plan. Bluem's model has pension levels sink to 64 percent of net earnings.
Saxony's Premier Biedenkopf, however, wanted a minimum pension level to be
established, financed through tax revenues. A final decision will be made
at a CDU party convention on Wednesday of next week. Following approval
there, coalition partner FDP will also have to approve the plan.

German Armed Forces helicopter deployed in Albania
</H1>
During an evacuation operation in Tirana, A German Bundeswehr
helicopter was shot at by Albanians from the back of a truck. According to
a report on Turkish television, German soldiers returned the fire. The
German Foreign Office says that the evacuation of the 110 Germans and
other foreign nationals was successfully completed. Federal Foreign
Minister Kinkel told the press in Bonn: "Since yesterday, the situation in
Albania is this: there is practically anarchy all over the country; there
is no control in the hands of police forces, ministries, or the
administration; there is a totally confused security situation which
changes hourly; there is gunplay in many areas; the international airport
Rinas (sp?) in Tirana is closed; the quick evacuation of the foreigners
wanting to leave became essential.
<P>
Federal Defence Minster Ruehe explained the course of the evacuation:
"Originally we wanted to land at the American embassy; I believe we were
already en route; then American helicopters also came under rocket-fire
and the Americans broke off the evacuation, so that we very quickly had to
decide on another spot to land, which we had our security forces secure,
and then carried out the operation. If the fact that our helicopters had
been deployed, and if the landing place had been known, the safety of our
soldiers would have been seriously put at risk.
<P>
Meanwhile, a mediator for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, Vranitzky, is pushing for a military intervention in Albania.
Vranitzky said, after a meeting with the new Albanian government leader
Fino (sp?) on board an Italian warship, that the European Union must
seriously consider sending in a multinational force. The Albanian state
press agency ATA has reported that at least 100 people have been killed so
far in the unrest.

Bundesrat passes several laws
</H1>
The Bundesrat completed a full agenda today. The states'
representatives approved the new vehicle tax that recently passed through
the Bundestag. The Bundesrat also passed the law requiring visas for
foreign children in Germany. Additionally, a decision was made about bad
weather allowances: the Bundesrat is in favour of its reintroduction,
finding that its abolishment did not achieve anything in the end, but
rather cost more than a billion Marks.

New store hours have created jobs
</H1>
The new store hours have slowed the loss of full-time jobs in the
retail sector and caused more part-time work to be available. The number
of those employed in retail work rose by 1.2 percent last November and
again by 0.1 percent in December. The Federal Statistics Office concludes
that the new extended store hours are responsible for the increases. It
has been almost exclusively part-time jobs that have been created, but at
least the wave of lay-offs of full-time employees has been stopped. The
Union for Trade, Banking, and Insurance, however, believes many of the
short-term contracts signed to be only for "610-Mark jobs" and that they
were only for the busy Christmas season.
<P>
The retail employers' association disagrees. Fifteen percent of stores are
employing more people than before, very few of those in the lowest-paying
category. A study by the Society for Consumer Research has also found that
the extended store hours are worth it, financially: retail sales are up
0.4 percent. The researchers' conclusion: if people have more time to
shop, they will also spend more.

Waigel wants to resume negotiations over tax reform immediately
</H1>
Federal Finance Minister Waigel wants to resume talks with the SPD
about tax reform as quickly as possible. Waigel presented a new draft of
the tax reforms: the gap in the federal treasury would, according to
Waigel's estimates, be smaller than was feared, at 8 billion Marks. He
wants to cover that amount by increasing indirect taxes. The minister did
not specify whether that means he is thinking of the value-added tax or,
as the SPD is demanding, the oil tax. The tax reform bill is to be
presented to the Bundestag on October 9, and to the Bundesrat in November,
so the reforms could still become law this year. Waigel called on the SPD
to resume the talks, which they had broken off, immediately. "As far as I
am concerned," he said, "we could resume the talks as early as this
afternoon."

Cattle cull begins in Bavaria
</H1>
In the coming week, Bavaria will begin destroying all the cows in
the state which came from Britain or Switzerland. The Ministry of Health
in Munich announced that more than 3,000 animals would be put to sleep in
order to fight mad cow disease. The Bundesrat today passed a decree
ordering the cull.
<P>
Many farmers in Upper Swabia, however, do not want to accept even this
decree. They plan to take the issue to court.

Baden-Wurttemberg: Interim credit for shortfalls due to tax reform
</H1>
Finance Minister Mayer-Vorfelder (sp?) wants to provisionally
finance budgetary shortfalls due to federal tax reforms by means of
limited-time credit. Baden-Wurttemberg is facing a budget gap of 2 to 3
billion Marks, he says, and further cuts cannot make up for a shortfall on
that scale.
<P>
The state SPD has criticized the suggestion. Their financial spokesman,
Herbert Moser, said that Mayer-Vorfelder is looking at the most expensive
of the possible courses of action. The term "provisional financing" is
intended to obscure his plan to acquire new debt, they charge.
Mayer-Vorfelder had previously explained that the line of credit he is
suggesting would not represent new debt.

Baden-Wurttemberg: Debate about future drug policies
</H1>
Criticism of the Baden-Wurttemberg FDP's application to change
the state's drug policies continues to come from the ranks of the CDU. At
the center of the dispute stands Economic Minister and FDP leader, Walter
Doering, who is behind the move.
<P>
The state spokesman for the CDU on drug-related matters, Ingrid Blank, has
said there will be no movement on the major points. Major points are,
especially, Doering's calls for drug houses and the controlled
distribution of heroin to those worst addicted. Such demands go beyond the
coalition agreement between the CDU and the FDP. Even in Erwin Vetter's
Social Ministry there is amazement over Doering's suggestions. The Social
Minster will not change his position, a spokesman said. The CDU's youth
organization, the Young Union, in northern Wurttemberg, says, however,
that it can imagine distributing heroin to the worst addicts under certain
circumstances. On the other hand, the CDU's federal spokesman on
drug-related issues, Roland Sauer, calls the position of the state FDP a
capitulation vis-a-vis the drug problem. Sauer is advocating the so-called
Swedish model, in which drug addicts can be forced into therapy for their
addiction.
