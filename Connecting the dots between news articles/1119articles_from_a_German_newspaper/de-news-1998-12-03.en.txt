Bundesbank reduces main money market rates
</H1>
Today the Bundesbank surprisingly lowered the main money market rates
from 3.3% to 3%, three weeks after requests from Finance Minister
Lafontaine were rejected by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer. The
measure was done because there is no inflation in Euro countries, but
the global economy has worsened and Germany will be affected by the
ailing financial markets. The decision will lower pessimism among
entrepreneurs and decrease insecurity on international markets.
Tietmeyer announced that the decrease would be the last for the
foreseeable future. Finance Minister Lafontaine, the opposition, as
well as credit institutes and the unions welcomed the decision.

Meeting of state premiers in Potsdam

Today's meeting of the state premiers in Potsdam resulted in a formation
of an investigation commission for the reform of the fiscal federalism.
The committee is supposed to analyze the existing financial relationship
among the countries and offer suggestions for a general reform. The SPD-led
states favoured a debate within the federal government, whereas Bavarian
Prime Minister Edmund Stoiber asked for an immediate participation of the
Bundestag and Bundesrat. All premiers rejected efforts of the European
Union to question fee financing of public broadcast.

Debate in Bundestag about immigration law
</H1>
Members of the FDP plan to control rather than increase the number of
foreign immigrants with an immigration limitation law. FDP General
Secretary Guido Westerwelle said that controlled immigration would be
of national interest. According to Secretary of the Interior Cornelly
Sonntag-Wolgers, it would be legitimate to measure immigration by the
economic potential of a country, but joining family members, those who
need protection, and emigrants should not be suffering as currently is
the case with the existing initiative. The red-green government intents
a reform of the citizenship law before introducing a new immigration law.

Pyrmont Bank robbers still on the run
</H1>
The two armed men who robbed a bank in Lower Saxony's Bad Pyrmont and
fled with two hostages are still on the run. They are probably in the
Ruedesheim area. The two hostages, the branch manager and a female bank
clerk, were released unharmed after a car chase in Frankfurt. The men's
vehicle was found, and the assumption that the men on foot are looking
for new hostages has not been confirmed. The downtown area of Ruedesheim
has been blocked off, and traffic collapsed.

Tomorrow final discussion on 1st phase of tax reform
</H1>
The union parties and the FDP are failing in their effort to further
delay the legislation for a tax reform. The request to postpone final
discussions until next Wednesday was rejected by President of the
Bundestag Wolfgang Thierse and the Council of Elders of the Bundestag.
The law contains an increase of children's allowance and a decrease of
the lowest tax rate. The FDP proposed the participation of Finance
Minister Lafontaine during the debate, who is currently visiting
Washington.
