SPD to challenge 1996 budget in constitutional court
</H1>
The SPD has lodged a complaint against last year's budget with
the constitutional court. Diller, the SPD budget spokesman, explained
that government borrowing has overtaken investment and, as it was
clear from the moment that the budget was drawn up that this would
occur, the budget was forbidden by the constitution. Wolfgang
Schauble, the leader of the CDU parliamentary party, has admitted that
federal investment could be less than borrowing this year as well,
saying that the great reduction in tax revenue was responsible for
this. This would mean that the general economic equilibrium would be
disturbed and this is only allowed in exceptional circumstances,
according to the constitution. If borrowing actually does overtake
investment this year as a result of the supplementary budget, the
parties in the governing coalition would have no option but to
recognise a disturbance in the general economic equilibrium. According
to a report in the Leipziger Anzeiger newspaper, Finance Minister Theo
Waigel is considering announcing a temporary stop to loan repayments
in an attempt to remedy the current financial crisis; the debts of
German Railways and the Fund for German Reunification will be
affected, according to the DPA (German Press Agency).

Government to go ahead with nuclear policy, ignoring SPD
</H1>
The federal government is planning to go ahead alone with its
nuclear policy for the future, ignoring the SPD. Angela Merkel, the
Minister for the Environment, announced that the cabinet is to discuss
the necessary changes in the law at the end of the month. Amongst
other things, a change in the law is planned as soon as possible to
meet the legal requirements which are necessary to allow the building
of a new type of reactor. The SPD had consistently rejected this idea
in past talks with the government aimed at finding a consensus on
energy policy.

environmental survey which for the first time ever has been divided up
to discuss the different branches of industry separately. According to

rest is caused by normal citizens, mostly through car use and burning
heating fuels.

Federal Constitutional Court rejects plan for new federal state
</H1>
The Federal Ministry of the Interior has rejected the call
for a referendum to set up a new federal state of Franconia. A
complaint to the constitutional court against this decision has now
been dismissed as obviously groundless. The judges considered that the
necessary condition for a referendum of this type, which requires that
a coherent economic and social area must exist, is not fulfilled. The
organisation which made the complaint is called the 'Franconian
Federation' and the state which they want to create would include
parts of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Thuringia.

IG-Metall to call strikes to ensure pensioners' part-time work plan
</H1>
Zambelli, the regional leader of the IG-Metall union in
Baden-Wuerttemberg, emphasised in an interview this morning that the
union is planning to force through their plan for part-time work for
pensioners with strike action if necessary. He said that the union
hopes to reduce the queues at employment offices with its plan, and if
the employers continued to refuse to compromise on the issue, then the
union would have no choice but to ballot its members for possible
industrial action. The discussions with employers on the issue in
Nordwuerttemberg-Nordbaden collapsed a week ago. The employers accuse
the union of not being prepared to allow a voluntary settlement.
