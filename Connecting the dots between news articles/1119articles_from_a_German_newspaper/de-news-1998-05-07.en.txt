Rolls Royce to go to VW after all?
</H1>
The Vickers group now intends to sell Rolls Royce not to BMW but
to VW. They said in London that VW made an offer exceeding the
BMW one by some DM 264 million. Vickers chairman Chandler (sp?)
said their aim was to sell Rolls Royce with maximum gain for
shareholders. He will therefore recommend voting in favour of
sale to VW at the special assembly coming up early in June.

<P>
Just a few days ago, an agreement with BMW had been reached. The
Munich based company did not want to comment tonight on the
possibility of tendering an improved offer. BMW has been
producing engines and components for Rolls and is threatening
with termination of these supplies.

Ministers stop bickering over gene files
</H1>
Minister for interior Kanther and minister for justice
Schmidt-Jorzig have put an end to their fight about setting up
gene files. They came to a consensus that the so-called "genetic
fingerprint" could be lifted and filed from all legally
condemned persons. There is not to be a special law, but just an
amendment to criminal process procedures. The gene file, to be
administrated by the Wiesbaden Federal Criminal Office, is meant
to increase the speed of discovering and arresting repeaters. To
identify a culprit, remains of blood, skin, saliva or sperm can
be used; often just a single hair is sufficient.
