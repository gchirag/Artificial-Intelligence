European Currency Union begins with a compromise
</H1>
The European Currency Union launched with a compromise. Fifteen EU
leaders agreed tonight [Sunday] that the Dutchman Wim Duisenberg will be
the first President of the European Central Bank. Mr. Duisenberg said
that he would probably not want to serve the full term of eight years,
but is likely to step down after an initial four years to make way for a
French successor. Without this declaration an agreement would not have
been reached, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said. The French candidate
Jean-Claude Triche will probably be the second President of the European
Central Bank. Among the directors of the central bank is German banker
Ottmar Issing. The European Central Bank is located in Frankfurt where it
can be as independent from politics as possible. Its mission is to make
sure that the Euro will be a strong currency.

<P>
Eleven countries will participate in the currency union starting January
1, 1999 - France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Spain,
Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Finland and Germany. National currencies will
continue to be used until 2002 when they will be replaced by the Euro.
The Finance Ministers of the EU have also set fixed exchange rates for
the European currencies until 2002 to avoid speculation. Until then,  one
Deutsche Mark is worth 3.35 French Francs or 990 Italian Lira. The
exchange rate of the European Currencies to the Euro will only be decided
in the end of the year. The approximate value of the Euro is expected to
be 1.95 Marks.

Divided opinions about Euro summit in Germany
</H1>
The decision of the EU summit on the launching of monetary union
has received mixed opinions in Germany. Politicians of the governing
coalition welcomed the decision, whereas the SPD criticized it. Mr. Haie,
spokesman for SPD candidate for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, said it
will undermine trust in the Euro if the currency is launched with a
breach of contract which in effect is the case with the compromise that
Wim Duisenberg is to be President of the Central Bank for four years only.

</H1>

the paper "Berliner Morgenpost" that the Green party expects that the
price of gasoline will increase to more than two Marks in the next five
years, The politician is sure that a new tax policy can be instituted
quickly. Mr. Schulz said it would take about nine months for a red-green
federal government to adopt ecologically and socially responsible tax
reforms. According to the plans of the Greens, mineral oil tax will be
increased by 50 pfennigs in the first year and 30 pfennig in each of the
following three years. Even against resistance of the SPD, the price of

Telekom wants to deny access to smaller competitors
</H1>
The German Telekom apparently plans to deny smaller competitors
access to its network. The weekly magazine "Focus" reported that access
will only be granted if a company owns some network of its own rather
than just trying to resell access. Klaus-Dieter Scheuerle of the
regulating government agency considers the contracts which grant cheap
access to private enterprises superfluous. A company which sells access
to Telekom lines only pays 2.7 Pfennig per minute. This advantageous
price is not necessary if the company does nothing but resell a Telekom
product, and according to "Focus", Dieter Scheuerle is of the opinion
that the Telekom is likely to give notice for most of the 34 contracts of
this kind.

Catholic church suffers lack of priests
</H1>
In the opinion of Augsburg theologist Mr. Heinz, forced
celibacy is the main reason for the lack of priests in the Catholic
church. If somebody wants to live an "unmarried" life in this day and
age, they have to come with extremely good reasons, said Mr. Heinz on
"Suedwestfunk" radio. Due to the of the lack of priests, the number of
priests who are overworked and unhappy is rising. According to Mr. Heinz,
this causes the physical and psychological problems for many priests. The
Augsburg theologist demanded from the German bishops to push the Vatican
to allow married men into priesthood.

Rhinelanders celebrate Kaiserslautern's victory
</H1>
Fans of the football team FC Kaiserslautern in the Rhineland celebrated
until the early hours of the morning. The "Red Devils" beat VfL Wolfsburg
with a convincing 4-0 win at the Betzenberg stadium yesterday evening
[Saturday] thus winning the German first division title. A parade of cars
kilometers long drove through the city. Fans leaned out of the windows
waving red-white FCK flags and sang, among other things "oh wie ist das
schoen". Tens of thousands of fans streamed to the historic center of the
town later in the evening, cheering and dancing. The city of
Kaiserslautern become so crowded with fans that people were not able to
move forwards or backwards. Their win opened an unassailable lead of four
points over defending champions Bayern Muenchen, who could manage only a
goalless draw away to MSV Duisburg. "Oh well - our first reaction is to
be disappointed that we didn't win our match, because we very much wanted
to win. The week and the match against Dortmund would then have been
exciting and interesting. The match next Saturday won't be a sporting
highlight anymore. One must also admit that when a team such as
Kaiserslautern advances to the top of the league in the time between the
fifth and 34th day of play, then they have really deserved to be the
German champions and should thus be heartily congratulated."
