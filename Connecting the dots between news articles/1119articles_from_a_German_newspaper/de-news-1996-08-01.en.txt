Erich Priebke acquitted in Italy
</H1>
The former SS Lieutenant Erich Priebke, who stands trial in Italy for WW II
crimes, has been acquitted on all essential charges by a military court in
Rome. The presiding judge, Mr. Quistelli, explained that the accusations
against the 83-year-old Priebke are subject to the statute of limitations.
The judge furthermore brought in extenuating circumstances. Priebke left the
court as a free man. The prosecution had charged Priebke with multiple and
particularly ferocious homicide. In the course of the trial, lasting three
months, Priebke had admitted to have shot to death two people himself.
He claimed, however, to have acted in an emergency situation, short of
superior orders. The verdict was met with disagreement in the courtroom.
Relatives of the SS victims called Priebke a fascist and a murderer.

Diverging opinions about planned tax reform
</H1>
The discussion around the envisaged major tax reform continues. The FDP
economics expert, Graf Lambsdorff, today came out in favor of advancing the
enactment of significant parts of the overhaul, currently planned for 1999.
On Deutschlandfunk radio Lambsdorff explained that in view of the employment
situation, a speedy reduction of the highest tax rates is necessary. Within
the reform package, Lambsdorff considers an increase of the VAT [value added
tax, sales tax] possible, in order to be able to cut income tax
significantly. The head of the FDP parliamentary group, Mr. Solms, however,
has deviated from the FDP's demand to enact the tax reform as early as 1998.
The CDU/CSU has repeatedly insisted that the reform not become effective
before 1999. Solms does not consider it feasible to implement the tax
reform before the Bundestag elections in 1998. However, the FDP sticks
to its three level model for taxation, according to which the highest tax
rate of currently 50% will be cut to 35%. Since this would reduce the tax
revenue by DM 120 billion, the Bavarian Finance Minister Erwin Huber
considers the FDP's provision illusory. Huber (CSU) said that a division
of labor, in which the FDP proclaims good deeds while the CDU/CSU has to
take care of financing, is unacceptable. The SPD Federal Executive
Manager, Mr. Muentefering, opposed the idea. In an interview with the
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper, Muentefering demanded that all
tax loopholes should be closed instead. The president of the Taxpayers'
Association, Mr. Daeke, made a similar statement. On Deutschlandradio Berlin
he called an increase of the VAT a punch in the face of the taxpayer.

to North Rhine Westphalia. 700 employees at 85 branch offices of a major

Large budget gap imminent in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
The imminent gap of 2.2 billion DM in the state budget forces
Baden-Wuerttemberg for the first time to make changes in the state's
liabilities. Finance Minister Meyer-Vorfelder cautioned today that if
measures are not taken quickly, one would have to slash investments. For
the first time, services required by law are now up for discussion.
Every minister already knows the amount that their department will have
to do without. For example, 210 million DM in the Welfare Ministry.
Here, the services required by law are the state child-care benefit, as
well as subsidies to hospitals and child care centers. Which of the
services are ultimately subject to be cut, will be decided by the
government after the summer break in September.

Vehicle registration document to be safer against counterfeiting
</H1>
The so-called KfZ-Schein [official vehicle registration document] will be
harder to counterfeit in the future. Such plans were announced by Minister
of the Interior, Kanther, and by Transportation Minister Wissmann in Bonn
today. The document is to be equipped with security marks,
make-specifically numbered, and imprinted with the first letter of the
license number. The two ministers emphazised that these measures, on the one
hand would make it easier for police to recognize forged registrations,
and on the other hand would impede the business of counterfeiters and
thieves.
