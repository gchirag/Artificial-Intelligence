Mr Riester: positive outlook for labour market
</H1>
Federal Labour Minister Riester is positive about the future of the labour
market. When interviewed on radio SUEDWESTFUNK, he said that he expected
the
number of unemployed to drop by some 300,000 till the end of next year,
and
the signals had been set for this to happen. He thought that government's
plans to reform the tax-system as well as the pension-system, would be
very
positive in that respect. Head of the Employers' Federation Hundt,
however,
was not all that happy with current developments. When interviewed by DPA,
he said that the tax-system had to be reformed quite fundamentally, and
the
same applied to the social-security system, if there was to be any chance
of
solving the labour-market's structural problems. Mr Hundt added that if in
the year 2000 awards-policies were achieved that boosted employment, this
could be a decisive factor.

Mr Biedenkopf: don't be (only) beastly to East Germany
</H1>
Saxony's Premier Biedenkopf was against exclusively negative comments on
East Germany's situation. When interviewed on radio DEUTSCHLANDFUNK, he
said
that there were a host of success-stories, and they should get emphasised.
Purchasing-power in East Germany would have reached almost 90% of West
Germany's level. He also recommended to base future comparisons on West
and
East Germany as a whole

Pension at age 60: partners think that there will be an agreement soon
</H1>
In spite of continued bickering about the pension at age 60, leading
representatives of the employers and the unions think that there will be
an
agreement soon. Mr Henkel, of the employers' side, and Mr Schmoldt, a
union
man, both were optimistic: "If we can't reach an agreement, all parties
concerned will have egg on their face". Federal Labour Minister Riester
renewed his commitment to head of Metalworkers' Union Zwickel, that he
would
back the pension at age 60 under certain conditions, both in talks about
the
Treaty for Work as well as in Cabinet.

Mr Schroeder: put a limit on how often chancellors can be re-elected
</H1>
There should be a voluntary agreement limiting the number of times a
Chancellor can be re-elected, according to Chancellor Schroeder. In an
interview with the news magazine DER SPIEGEL he said that a total of 10
years should be enough. He was referring to his predecessor Kohl when he
stated that a current Chancellor could easily be led to believe that he
was
indispensable, so anyone 'rocking the boat' would have to face his music
and
the consequences, usually 're-organisation/re-deployment'.

The churches on Christmas Eve
</H1>
Christmas as a festival of hope, amidst a world full of wars and affairs,
that was the message in many sermons on Christmas Eve. Protestant and
catholic preachers appealed to people to live together in peace. The
former
war in Yugoslavia had demonstrated what happens when this is not the case.
Hanover's state bishop Kaessmann (sp?) asked for more life being put into
the Peace Movement. The catholic church in Munich invited squatters, poor
and
lonely people to the Hofbraeuhaus
