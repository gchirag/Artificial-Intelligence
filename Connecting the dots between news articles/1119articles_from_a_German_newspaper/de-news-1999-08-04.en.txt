Schroeder defends pension plans in letter to senior citizens
</H1>
Following the example set by the CDU/CSU, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has
now also personally addressed German seniors in a letter. In it, he
reaffirmed his government's intention of introducing a tax-financed
guarantee of old-age security especially for those receiving the smallest
pensions, "in order to prevent poverty in old-age".
Meanwhile, the FDP has appealed to all parties to return to a consensus on
pensions. The party has offered to mediate. SPD caucus leader Peter Struck
announced a meeting with FDP leader Wolfgang Schaeuble in September.

Struck's controversial tax proposal apparently condoned
</H1>
According to sources within the SPD, party caucus leader Peter Struck
received prior approval from Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Finance
Minister Hans Eichel before proposing his suggested controversial changes
to the tax system. Struck's proposal calls for the elimination of all
tax-brackets except three: 15, 25, and 35 percent.
The president of the metal industry's employers' association, Stumpfe, has
said that the tax dispute within the SPD is damaging Germany as an
economic base.

Klimmt again criticizes federal government
</H1>
The Social-Democratic premier of the Saarland, Klimmt, has again
criticized the federal government, thus ignoring an appeal by Chancellor
Schroeder for greater party discipline. In an interview, Klimmt said that
the goal of cutting federal expenditures by 30 billion DM must not become
a matter of dogma. The finance spokesman for the Green Party, Metzger,
subsequently called Klimmt a security risk to the federal Coalition.
Klimmt belongs to the left wing of the SPD. He is protesting against the
reform policies of the Coalition.
State elections in the Saarland are to be held on September 5.

EU Commission grants Germany more time in beef dispute
</H1>
Over British protests, the EU Commission has decided to give Germany more
time to resume imports of British beef. It is expected that the German ban
will be lifted following the session of the Bundesrat on September 24.
However, there is no official deadline for the lifting of the ban. German
Federal Health Minister Fischer, in a BBC interview, defended German
reservations. She said she wanted to make sure that safety measures
against mad-cow disease were working.
The EU veterinary committee also today announced its decision that Belgium
must now examine its beef for dioxins before it goes to market.

Further liberalization of store hours expected
</H1>
The odds that store hours will be liberalized before the end of this year
are increasing all the time. Although the federal government does not
currently see any need to discuss easing the restrictions of the Store
Hours Law (Ladenschlussgesetz), a majority of the states do favour the
idea. Several state ministers have already come out in favour of allowing
shops to remain open until at least 6 pm on Saturdays. There does not
appear to be any prospect of shops being open on Sundays. Many businesses,
however, have said that they would like to open their doors on Sundays as
well.

Civilian service manager: term reduction would cause problems
</H1>
The federal manager of the civilian service program (alternative to
compulsory military service for objectors), Hackler, has admitted that
reducing the term of service from 13 months to 11 could cause problems. He
told the Rheinsche Post newspaper that existing civilian service positions
could not necessarily be filled on a smooth, continuous basis if the term
of service were only 11 months.
The CDU/CSU warned against gutting the civilian service program any
further. CDU/CSU deputy caucus leader, Ruettgers, told SWR radio that
civilian service was an essential part of the German social system.
The FDP want military and civilian service shortened to terms of 5-6
months.
