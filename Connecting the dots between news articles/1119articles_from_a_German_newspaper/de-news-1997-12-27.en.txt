Herzog criticizes unwillingness to reforms
</H1>
Federal President Roman Herzog criticized the unwillingness in German society
to bring about reforms.  In a newspaper interview, Herzog stated that many
people act only in the interest of unions and groups.  He expressed
disappointment in the fact that there will be no tax reform in the current
legislative period.  A reduction of the total state tax revenue is necessary
in view of international competition and despite financial difficulties.  The
Federal President also demanded that the tax law be more clear-cut.
Mr. Herzog once again stressed that he would not run for a second term.

</H1>
Struck, parliamentary leader of the SPD Bundestag Faction has called for
employers to be neutral in regard to political parties in the 1998 election
campaign.  Mr. Struck commented in an interview that German industry should
put an end to its private election campaign support for Federal Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.  He directed his criticisms for the most part at the presidents
of the Federal Association of German Employer Unions and the Federal
Association of German Industry, Hundt and Henkel, respectively.  Both have
once again voiced their strong objections to SPD chairman Oskar Lafontaine
becoming Federal Chancellor.  They warned that the Saarland minister
president's views on economic policy give everyone a reason to fear the
worst.

State tax redistribution system remains disputed
</H1>
The state tax redistribution system remains disputed.  Rhineland-Palatinate
Minister President Beck rejects a new regulation as it is mainly directed by
Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg and sees no chance for a constitutional
challenge.  Beck said that the existing finance redistribution system could
be seen as an example of practiced solidarity; it is the bulwark against
egoism and pulpit politics.  The minister presidents Stoiber and Teufel, on
the other hand, would like to effect a change in the tax redistribution
system by issuing a challenge at the Federal Constitutional Court. They
believe that the current regulation places the richer States at a
disadvantage.

policies are lacking.

Relocation of government increases red tape
</H1>
The government's relocation from Bonn to Berlin will inflate government
bureaucracy, in the opinion of the director of the Federal Court of Auditors,
Mr. Teschner.  The intentions for a leaner government have not been realized,
he said.  Every ministry that moves to the new capital will retain a branch
office in Bonn.  Conversely, every ministry that stays will install a branch
office in Berlin.  According to Teschner this is a less than ideal situation.
He supports reducing the number of ministries from fifteen to eight.
Furthermore, the duties of all ministries should be checked for their
necessity and returned to the states if found superfluous.

University presidents push for implementation of reforms
</H1>
 The presidents of institutions of higher education in Germany have
pressed for carrying though with promised reforms of the higher education
system.  Their chairman, Mr. Landfried, confirmed that federal and state
authorities agree on most issues.  A new legislative framework for the higher
education system should not be held up by the remaining unresolved question
of whether or not to allow tuition fees.  Reforming the BAFoeG law [a federal
program of financial assistance for students] is also long overdue.

Finance ministers plan to hunt down tax evaders
</H1>
 Germany may soon become a country that offers rewards for people
who report tax evaders.  According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel"
Federal and State finance ministers want to come to a decision on the
issue as soon as January.  So far they have only agreed to not offer an
honorarium to informants from the private sector, such as a divorced
spouse.  Rewards for bank employees providing documents to the fiscal
authorities are considered a particularly sensitive issue.

Differing opinions on Euro within the CSU

Within the CSU opinions on the European Monetary Union differ.  The chairman
of the CSU delegation in Bonn, Mr. Glos, called for putting an end to
spreading fear about the Currency Union.  In an interview, Mr. Glos demanded
the CSU must now demonstrate clearly that it has recognized the merits of the
Euro.  Bavarian Minister President Stoiber, however, maintains that the final
word on the planned launch of the Monetary Union on January 1, 1998 has not
been spoken yet.  Mr. Glos commented that de jure the decision is still open,
but de facto has been already been made.

Henkel: Economy starts the new year with a liability
</H1>
 According to President of the Association of German Industry
(BDI) Henkel, the German economy carries a liability into the new year.
Mr. Henkel fears that the hike in sales tax will make the unions' hungry for
higher wages.  In an interview with the newspaper "Stuttgarter Nachrichten"
Mr. Henkel said higher wages could destabilize the price index, thereby
forcing the Bundesbank to raise interest rates.  BDI President Henkel expects
a slight upturn of the domestic economy.  The Asia crisis, however, might
affect the German economy more strongly than anticipated.  Mr. Henkel called
on the government to change its tax policy.  He pointed out that it is a
misconception to associate lower taxes with lower revenue.  The opposite is
most likely true.

Henkel encourages disregarding industry-wide bargaining agreements
</H1>
BDI President Henkel has encouraged Western German employers as well as
several of their Eastern German colleagues to stray from the typical
industry-wide wage agreements.  Mr. Henkel said in an interview that had
there not been a closed front against the industry-wide wage agreements, the
economic situation in Eastern Germany would be much worse.  Only that way was
it possible to pay lower wages and increase work hours.  Furthermore, the BDI
chairman opined that bargaining parties should not always strive for mutually
agreeable solutions.  The German model of consensus is ill-suited for today's
challenges.  There are too many round table discussion and too few rigorous
decisions, Mr. Henkel concluded.

After debacle of A-class now also mishaps in the new S-class?
</H1>
 After the debacle involving the Mercedes' A-class series of
passenger cars, it now appears that the top model line S-class also has
problems.  According to the news magazine "Focus", just ten months prior to
market introduction, massive technical difficulties persist.  The magazine
reports that there are still 150 defects on an in-house list for the
luxurious sedan.  This might jeopardize the planned shipping date in
September.  Malfunctions range from jammed power locks to problems with an
electronic guidance system under cold weather conditions.  Most problems are
related to elaborate electronic systems that drive transmission, engine and
suspension.  "Focus" quotes a Mercedes internal source saying that several
test models have already burnt out as a result of faulty electronics.
Daimler Benz has rejected reports of delays with the S-class series.  A
spokesman for Daimler said in an interview with "Sueddeutscher Rundfunk"
radio that the S-class models will be delivered as scheduled.  Technical
problems during development are routine and will be countered with increased
efforts if necessary.  It would be unjustified to jump to the conclusion that
a longer-than-normal list of defects automatically leads to delays.
