Criticism of CDU election program reaffirmed
</H1>
Mr. Protzner, Secretary-General of the Christian-Social Union's
(CSU), has reaffirmed his party's rejection of the Christian Democratic
Union's (CDU) election program. The main point of contention between the
sister parties continues to be the introduction of an environmental tax.
Mr. Protzner said that the CSU would never introduce such a tax and that
after the general election taxes should be lowered and not raised, no
matter what the reasoning. Yesterday, Bavaria's Minister of Finance, Mr.
Huber, threatened that the CSU will put forward their own program if the
CDU shows itself unable to find common ground.

</H1>
The Union for Trade, Bank and Insurance Employees (HBV)
demands a stop to personnel reductions in the bank and insurance sectors.
Today Mr. Karlin, a member of the Executive Board, called the situation a
scandal. While Commerce Bank and Allianz insurance groups are increasing
their dividends, more jobs are cut. The HBV is of the opinion that double
digit profit increases should be used to secure jobs. According to the

percent in the past two years in spite of excellent profits.

Coalition of leading concert organizers
</H1>
Four international concert organizers have formed a coalition
which is so far unique in this sector. According to a report of the
German Press Agency (dpa), the agencies "Mama Concerts", "Rau" "Fritz Rau
GmbH NCT" and "Target" will in the future be amalgamated into one company
called "The Concert Companies". Given that each agency has a different
focus, all the important sectors of live entertainment in Germany will be
covered. For example, 25 tours are planned before the fall, among them
Eric Clapton, Eros Ramazotti and Peter Maffay.
