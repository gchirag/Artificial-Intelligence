Germany fulfils deficit criteria for Maastricht in 1997
</H1>
The federal statistics office has calculated the increase of
internal debt for 1997: 2.9% of GIP, according to coalition
spokespeople. This means that Germany has met the so-called
"deficit criteria" of the Maastricht convention, which establish a
limit of 3% for new public borrowing. In Bonn it is taken for
granted that this will enable Germany to get in on the ground
floor of European economic and currency unification. The final
decision on this matter lies with the meeting of European
chiefs of state and government heads in early May. They will
of course have to take into account that another important
goal could not be met last year: the overall debt level. According
to the Maastricht convention, this should not exceed 60% of GIP.

Public Health service closes 1997 in the black
</H1>
For the first time since 1994, the public health services are
showing a surplus. In spite of losses in the first semester,
1997 closed DM 1.1 billion in the black. The second half
of 1997 showed a surplus of DM 5 billion, due to the
implementation of the reform bill. About half of this surplus
comes from higher contributions for pharmaceuticals and
hospitals. The other half is the result of general administrative
streamlining. Since July, expenditures with patients came down
by 3%, mainly due to lower expenditures with health resorting,
sick pay, social services and pharmaceuticals.
Health minister Seehofer ascribes the result to his reform
and also as proof for the fact that it will still be necessary to
continue the subsidies paid by western health services to
their eastern counterparts. He would not hear of discussions
in the line of the recent disagreements about nursing care.
He also ruled out any reduction of contribution levels before
unemployment rates start to drop.

Scholz defends proposals for agrarian reform
</H1>
The vice-chairman of the union parliamentary fraction, Scholz,
defended the plan for an agrarian reform as worked out by
a committee he chaired. In an interview with Berlin's daily
"Der Tagesspiegel", Scholz said the proposals intended mainly
to help former landowners with stepping into their legal rights.
Complaints that these proposals would question the agrarian
reform or the law on indemnification and claims equalisation
were nonsense, he said. He stressed that all decisions of the
committee were approved by the CDU's members of
the Bundestag from eastern Germany. Yesterday, Brandenburg's
state parliament had criticised the proposals and warned against
setbacks for east German farmers.
