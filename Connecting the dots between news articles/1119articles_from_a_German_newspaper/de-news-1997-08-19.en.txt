OECD expects further economic growth in Germany
</H1>
According to the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development) the German economy is growing but the employment situation
will not ameliorate soon. In its latest Germany report the OECD estimates
there will be on average 4.3 million unemployed this year, or a rate of
11.1 percent. The economy will grow by 2.25 percent this year and by 2.75
percent next year according to their calculations. Biggest problem for the
job market is the high wage fringe costs. The OECD called upon government
and opposition to agree on a large tax reform. To reduce the unemployment
it was necessary to reduce the tax load for private households and
companies.
The OECD also stated that this year Germany will fail to meet the
Maastricht criterion for new debts of 3.0 percent of the gross national
product. However, the margin of error for the forecast of 3.25 percent
includes the 3.0 threshold.

Agreement on new university law
</H1>
Federal government and states have agreed on a new law regulating
universities. In future, universities are to compete more for money and
students. The new law stipulates that the funding for each university will
depend on performance in research and teaching. On the other side,
universities will get more room for reforms. New academic degrees are to
make the universities more attractive internationally. In addition,
curriculums [for a Master's degree] will be shortened to maximal 4.5 years.
A credit system is to facilitate the interchange with foreign universities.
There was no agreement on the introduction of tuition fees. The first
reading of the bill will be in September.

Interior Minister presents programme against crime
</H1>
Minister of Interior Affairs Manfred Kanther has called on citizens,
federal states and the justice system to fight crime more vigorously. In a
platform statement on interior security Kanther said the amount of crime
could only be reduced by firm action of all parts of society. Courts had to
sentence perpetrators faster and more severely. All citizens had to work
against slow deterioration of values and reject violence. The media ought
to renounce unnecessary presentation of violence. According to Kanther
increasing crime is caused by the change of values, disappearing sense for
right and wrong, and the individualization of the society.

Partial acquittal in case of online offers for torture-sex
</H1>
The Regional Court of Traunstein has acquitted the sado-maso couple from
Rosenheim. They were accused of offering children for money on the German
internet provider T-Online for torture-sex. The court did not follow the
prosecution in their demand for long-term imprisonment. The court found
there was no proof that the accused had really made appointments for
murder, kidnapping, and rape.
The accused, a 31-year-old truck driver and his 37-year-old common-law
spouse, were however sentenced to 18 months and 2 months, respectively, on
probation for other crimes such as prostitution. The judges were mostly in
line with the defence.
