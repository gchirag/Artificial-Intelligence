Sentence against RAF terrorist Birgit Hogefeld partially reversed
</H1>
Faulty evidence in the case of the attack on the Penal Institution of
Justice in Weiterstadt has lead to this decision made at the Higher
Regional Court in Frankfurt. The judges' verdict could not be deduced
from the immediate acting of the defendant. The life sentence for
Hogefeld remains active though due to other crimes she committed.
Hogefeld had been convicted of murder and other crimes during one of
the last major proceedings of RAF terrorists in 1996.

Desperate search for Christina continues
</H1>
Three days after 11-year-old Christina disappeared from the Weser-Ems
district police and German army troops are still desperately searching
for the girl. A first trail was found yesterday when the backpack of
the girl was found along the shore of the Weser-Ems-Channel. Divers
were searching the bottom of the channel with underwater cameras and a
sonar device. A search team of about 500 persons is still searching
both shores. The backpack was apparently washed ashore so it is hard
to say where the girl lost it. Several hundred clues from citizens
have been received, but not a hot one.

Castor container transport forthcoming
</H1>
Anti-nuclear protestors and the police are engaged in a new standoff
as a controversial shipment of spent fuel rods begins its rail journey
to Ahaus. The containers from Grundremmingen and Neckarwestheim will
be brought together at a coal power plant in Wahlheim near Stuttgart.
From there about 60 tonnes of radioactive fuel rods will be railed to
an interim storage facility in Ahaus. The protestors blocked Gate 2 of
the nuclear power plant in Neckarwestheim to stop the shipment.
Apparently the shipment from Neckarwestheim is endangered by a street
tunnel. Policemen were busy trying to get the protestors out of the
tunnel. Two protestors chained themselves in a cave under the shipment
route. Policemen with spades and pick-axes tried to reach the buried
protestors.

Union opposes agrarian plans of EU Commission
</H1>
The EU Commision has caused an outcry with its proposition for future
agrarian and farming-structure policies. The President of the German
Farmer's Association, Sonnleitner, called the plan disastrous and
accused Brussels of a calculated strategy to destroy jobs. The Federal
Government announced opposition against the EU plan which would be
realized in 1999 at the earliest. But already this year Bonn wants to
ease the farmers' lives. Starting July 1st , a tax lump sum will be
increased to 10%. Bonn will also change another law so that farmers
can have more cattle without being disadvantaged taxwise. The Federal
Minister of Agriculture, Jochen Borchert, rejects the EU plan and
announced that major changes will be made in collaboration with other
EU countries.

another week. The two mediators Hans Koschnik and Karl Ludwig said

Negative forecast
</H1>
Experts of the economy are expecting a drastic increase in pension
premium rates. Without a change of the current system the rate will
increase from the current 20.3% to 25% by the year 2030, and
afterwards to 28%. The experts suggested to invest a part of the
contributions made to the legal pension plan in a private retirement
fund or insurance. With this system the aspired pension level of 64%
of average net earnings could be maintained even after the year 2030.

German drivers have to be prepared that a suspension of their driving
licence in another EU country will also lead to a suspension in
Germany. The Federal Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jortzig announced
such an EU agreement for May. The only disagreements are between
Germany and Austria. In Austria a suspension can be shorter than a
month whereas in Germany it has to be at least one month.
