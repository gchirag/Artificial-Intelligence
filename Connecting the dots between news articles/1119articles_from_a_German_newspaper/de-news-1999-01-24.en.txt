CDU/CSU nominate candidate for Federal President
</H1>
The CDU and CSU want to officially nominate Eastern German
physicist Dagmar Szipanski tonight as their candidate for the office of
Federal President. Shortly before the parties' strategy summit in
Neu-Isenburg, in Hesse, CSU leader Edmund Stoiber said that he thought CDU
leader Wolfgang Schaeuble's suggestion was particularly good, and that
Szipanski was an excellent candidate. He added that the presidential
election would be more interesting than many had thought. He said that
Szipanski had proven herself resolute under the former East German regime,
and begun her scientific career only after it opened up.
Deputy leader of the SPD caucus, Ulla Schmidt, criticized the CDU/CSU plan
to offer their own candidate to succeed the current president, Roman
Herzog, saying they were merely using the woman to play games, as she had
no chance of winning the election.
The 55-year-old professor from Thuringia will face former North
Rhine-Westphalia Premier, Johannes Rau, for the presidency on May 23.

Violence in CDU petition campaign
</H1>
The official opening of the country-wide petition campaign by the
CDU opposing the government's planned reform of the citizenship laws has
been met with a series of attacks. Signature stands in several cities were
attacked, and shoving and punching did occur.
Federal Internal Affairs Minister, Otto Schily, meanwhile, has called on
the CDU/CSU to make possible a referendum on the proposed changes, adding,
however, in Deutschlandfunk radio, that that would require a change to the
constitution. He said the CDU/CSU have not responded to an offer to
discuss the matter. Leader of the SPD caucus, Peter Struck described the
campaign as unchristian, saying that the CDU/CSU were strengthening the
parties of the extreme right-wing with their campaign. The Greens, at a
small party meeting, also criticized the Opposition's actions sharply.
Even a member of the CDU executive, Heiner Geissler, expressed skepticism.
In a newspaper interview, he said his party had allowed itself to be yoked
with a campaign that would not earn it any votes from the middle of the
political spectrum. He added that it was, furthermore, wrong to allow this
confrontation to be conducted on the street.

Nuclear withdrawal: no agreement in sight, two days before talks
</H1>
Two days before "consensus talks" are to begin over the planned
withdrawal from nuclear power, the federal government and energy producers
have confirmed their different positions. Power plant operators demand the
cancellation of plans to ban the reprocessing of nuclear waste as of
January 1, 2000. According to the companies' coordinator for the talks,
Manfred Timm, tomorrow's preparatory meeting with Federal Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder will deal exclusively with the topic of reprocessing.
Schroeder, in a television interview with ZDF, said that he places a great
deal of value on reaching an understanding with the energy companies, but
wanted to stick to the schedule as planned. He said that the government
wanted to initiate the amendment to the law on Wednesday, despite
reservations on the part of the Justice Ministry. Legal reservations could
be worked into the process once it was already underway, according to the
Chancellor.
