election, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder greeted French President Jacques
Chirac at Berlin's Tegel Airport.  After the welcoming ceremonies,

reduction of Germany's net payments to the European Union was discussed.

method had not yet been reached.  All 15 EU members must agree to a new

SPD against value-added tax hike
</H1>
SPD leadership spoke out against a hike on the value-added tax.  After a
meeting of the Praesidium, Party chief and Federal Finance Minister Oscar
Lafontaine said that such a step is out of the question, given the current
economic situation.

North Rhine-Westphalia's State Premier
Clement.  There was no word from the chancery in Dusseldorf that Clement
intended to push the issue.  The premier simply expressed
consideration for European tax accords.

Stoiber criticizes plans for European financial balance
</H1>
Bavarian Minister President Stoiber accused the federal government of
scrapping national interests. Plans in the Chancellor's office for a
European
financial compensation scheme for the coordination of tax, employment and
wage policy in the EU would mean more German payments to Brussels,
Stoiber said to Bild newspaper.  All participants in the plan would have to
stand on their own against keener competition in the 11 countries of the
European Currency Union.  States that provide too high of wages and social
standards should take responsibility for it themselves, stated the CSU
politician.
A compensation scheme in Europe benefitting other EU states would not be
accepted by the German people.

Hostage drama in Munich ends without bloodshed
</H1>
A hostage drama in a Munich pharmacy ended without casualty.  Two
hostage-takers set both of their last hostages free unharmed, then turned
themselves in.  Coming out of the store with hands raised, an operation
official ordered them to their knees.  Police then apprehended the two
after shoving them to the floor.  In the course of the exhausting ordeal,
which lasted into the night, the armed men gradually released all four
store clerks.  The women have been treated for shock, but are otherwise
unharmed.  An attorney and a psychologist talked the masked men into
surrendering by cell phone, after their robbery attempt this morning
has gone awry.
