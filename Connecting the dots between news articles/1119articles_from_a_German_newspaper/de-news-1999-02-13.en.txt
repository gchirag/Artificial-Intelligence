Government plans to remove driving privileges above 0.5/1000
</H1>
The federal government wants to increase the penalties for driving
under the influence of alcohol. Transportation Minister Muentefering
announced that a stricter regulation will take effect. Under the new
regulation, drivers can lose their licenses if their blood alcohol
level exceeds 0.5/1000. Previously, this was only possible when
exceeding 0.8/1000. In addition to harsher regulations on driver's
license removal, the number of drunk driving police checks will
significantly increase. According to Mr. Muentefering, police in every
state will be equipped with new equipment that will eliminate the need
for expensive blood tests and also allow the police to perform more
checks.

AOK against limiting choice of physician
</H1>
According to estimates from Mr. Nachtigal, the chairman of the federal
association advisory committee of the AOK (a national heath care
insurance provider), only 5% of those insured in Germany regularly
choose another physician. Mr. Nachtigal stated, "Doctor-switching is by
no means as popular a sport as some politicians would like to make it."
He is therefore concerned that the costs of several hundred million
marks to convert microchip cards would not be worth the benefits. Mr.
Dressler, SPD health expert, suggested yesterday that the microchip
cards be reprogrammed so that a family physician can only be changed
quarterly.

the German government acknowledges every aspect of its history. The

and 1944 in Auschwitz. The majority of the victims were Jews.

Employers in metal industry prepared to compromise
</H1>
According to Werner Stumpfe, Gesamtmetal head, the employers will
forgo any game-playing and tactics and have announced their willingness
to reach an agreement with the trade union in the metal worker wage
dispute. Tomorrow, the industrial metal trade union (IG-Metall) will
set the stage for upcoming negotiations. The employers are prepared,
under certain conditions, to make a better offer in an arbitration
process. According to the newspaper "Bild am Sonntag", Gesamtmetal head
Stumpfe would like to make the wage increases be dependent on the
economic situation of individual industries. He continued that this
plan would preserve the flat tariff contract for the 7000 member
companies. Mr. Stumpfe would like to include works councils in making
the decision about wage increases, which are partly dependent on
positive returns. He stated that if the worker representatives do not
agree, the wage increase will not exceed the general wage increase. He
did not say at what point the additional wage increase would not go
into effect. At present, the metal workers have gotten an offer to
receive only 2.3% more in wages and a one-time payment of 0.5%. More and
more, the much sought after Labor Alliance is playing a role in the
metal workers' labor dispute. Federal Minister of Labor Riester and leading
members of the German federation of unions warned the employers
not to let the Alliance fall apart. The employers, in turn, accused IG-
Metall of endangering the negotiations for more work, education, and
competitiveness with their demands.

leaking through holes into the tidal shallows of the North Sea. The
environmental minister of Schleswig-Holstein described the Greenpeace
action as unnecessary. The wreck of the Pallas was under constant
