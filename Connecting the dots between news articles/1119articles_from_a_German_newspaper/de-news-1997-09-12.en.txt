Last day of the budget discussions
</H1>
After four days of discussing the federal budget in parliament,
the SPD-party re-iterated their strong criticism of Minister Waigel's draft.
This budget was not professional and would soon become scrap-paper,
according to Mr Diller, a member of parliament for the SPD, qualifying
government's behaviour as procrastination in order to make sure imminent
receivership (the equivalent of chapter 11 in the USA) did not happen before
the upcoming federal elections.

<P>
Minister Waigel defended his stand and asked the opposition to join the
coalition partners and try to reach a compromise. The SPD claimed that
government did not really want an agreement, and that coalition partner FDP
did not agree with the CDU/CSU-coalition. Therefore they asked for a new
draft to be presented by all coalition parties.

<P>
Committees will now look at the additional budget 1997 plus the draft for the
current one. Both are to be finalised in November.

Mr Scharping misses clear concept for tax- and pension-reforms
</H1>
Head of the SPD, Mr Scharping, said that he still could not
see any proposals by the coalition parties that could be used for a
compromise as far as tax- and pension-reforms went. On radio Suedwestfunk,
however, he agreed to have another go at forging a compromise this Thursday.
He stated that, as in the past, the coalition partners CDU, CSU and FDP
did not agree among themselves.

Employers in the metal industry want voluntary part-time work/retirement
</H1>
Employers in the metal industry  will say yes to an award
covering early part-work/retirement only if the latter is non-compulsory.
They most certainly will not agree to a compulsory version. The unions,
however, insist on this item becoming compulsory. Currently awards-talks are
being held in Southern Wuerttemberg/Baden, and employers are planning to
set an example for the rest of the country.

Mr Herzog: Germans have to become more open to technical progress
</H1>
Last night German President Herzog kicked off a "festival of new ideas" at
his official residence (Berlin's Bellevue). He told some 5000
invited guests that there was no way technical progress could be damned
as such; we should rather look at advantages and disadvantages in a rational
manner. For far too long Germans had only looked at the risks and
dangers of progress; now it was time to rekindle innovative approaches and
creativity. There already were some positive signs that this was happening,
especially as far as the young generation was concerned. According to his
office, Mr Herzog wanted to use his 'garden party' to advertise for Germany
as a place for research and development. Approx. 50 inventions were on
display at the party.

Former President von Weizsaecker is not a financial member of the CDU-party
any more, according to a spokes-person. After having been President for 10

either. It was standard procedure to strike him off the register of members.

had never been told that he had been struck off the register.

Once again beef from Britain surfaces in Germany
</H1>
Once again Germany discovered beef that possibly had been
imported from Great Britain, according to North-Rhine/Westphalia's ministry
of agriculture. Some 20 metric tons had been impounded whereas more than 60
metric tons had been consumed or were still circulating in the system.
A dealer from Westphalia allegedly had sold beef to a total of 88 companies
all over Germany. As of 1996 beef from Great Britain had been banned
for export because of BSE.
