Summit talks in metal industry remain without results
</H1>
 The second meeting of leading representatives from metal industry
and unions on the issue of sick pay adjourned without tangible results.  The
representatives of IG Metall and of the employers' association Gesamtmetall
now want to decide by October 19 whether there will be another meeting.  The
president of Gesamtmetall, Mr. Stumpfe, underscored that employers are only
willing to convene again if a package resolving all open questions in the
bargaining agreement can be passed.  Aside from the controversial sick pay,
these include the amounts of Christmas and vacation bonuses, as well as the
upcoming round of wage negotiations.  IG Metall chairman Zwickel explained
his union is open for continued talks with employers.  However, he is not
overly optimistic on the topic of sick pay.

State of the union address
</H1>
 Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt expects that wages in East Germany
will permanently fall short of West German levels.  In his state of the union
address on the occasion of the anniversary of German Unification, Rexrodt
said before the Bundestag that employers can only pay wages which are backed
by revenue.  Therefore, the flexibility for undifferentiated adjustments to
West German levels is at an end.  The unification process has turned out to
be more difficult than anticipated in 1990.  Nevertheless, the "emergency
operation German Unification" has gone surprisingly well.  The SPD accused
the government of euphemizing the situation.  East Germany is again losing
ground compared to West Germany, the SPD representative Mr. Schwanitz said.
While the government continued talking about a blooming land, the catch-up of
the East to the West has almost ceased to exist, he concluded.

turned down the proposal by the mediation committee which advocated dropping
the clause.  327 members of parliament voted against the mediation
committee's result, 320 voted in favor, there was one abstention.  This means
that a woman raped by her husband has the option to discontinue legal
proceedings against him.

Baden-Wuerttemberg records more apprentice positions than applicants
</H1>
 According to the state government and the trade convention, there
are currently more open apprentice positions in Baden-Wuerttemberg than
applicants.  As Minister President Teufel explained, the businesses carry
most of the credit for that.  Reportedly, many apprenticeships arise from
making direct contact with the companies.  To that extent, the statistics do
not reflect the real situation, for they are exclusively based on figures of
applicants referred by the Labor Offices.
