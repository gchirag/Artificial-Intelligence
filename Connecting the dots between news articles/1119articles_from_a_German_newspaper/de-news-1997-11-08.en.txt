Scharping offers to work with coalition
</H1>
 Social democratic parliamentary party leader Rudolf Scharping and
his party have submitted a proposal to the coalition to reduce tax and
contribution rates.  He told the TV channel "n-tv" that in view of the
current situation, Germany could not afford an eleven-month election
campaign; instead, Scharping continued, unalterable decisions will have to
be made in favor of the employment situation and social security.  SPD
politicians spoke in support of relieving the retirement fund by re-financing
extraneous benefits. Scharping said that the basis for such benefits could
be the suggestion of parliamentary party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble to
increase the sales tax to 16 per cent and to raise the mineral oil tax.

Campaign against land mines
</H1>
 With a day of campaigns, relief works and peace initiatives have
again demanded that land mines be eliminated.  The head of the organization
"Medico international," Mr. Gebauer said that the campaign "Raeumt die
Mine" (Clean up the Mines) underlines the demand to completely re-assign
the money earmarked for mine technology to humanitarian causes.  Gebauer
emphasizes that in spite of successes, like the awarding of the Nobel
Peace Prize to the international campaign to outlaw land mines, there are
still more land mines that are being planted than removed.
