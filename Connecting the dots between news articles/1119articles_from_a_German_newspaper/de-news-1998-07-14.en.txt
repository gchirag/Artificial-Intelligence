BVG clears the way for spelling reform
</H1>
The spelling reform can be introduced as planned, taking effect
on August 1. The Federal Constitutional Court (BVG) has dismissed a case
brought by opponents of the reform, and decided that the spelling reform
did not violate the constitution. The Judges said a resolution of the
Council of Ministers of Culture was sufficient to implement the reform - it
did not need a bill passed by parliament. The Judges also stressed that the
reform did not violate the right of a Luebeck couple [of lawyers] to
educate their children. The Judges of the Constitutional Court pointed out
as well that even different spelling rules in different German states were
a possibility [when it comes to constitutionality].

<P>
The Federal Constitutional Court did not have to rule on the spelling
reform as such, but whether the resolution of the Council of Ministers of
Culture [of the different German states] sufficed to implement it. The
plaintiffs had withdrawn the case last week after reports on the expected
decision of the court were published in some newspapers.

<P>
The Ministers of Culture of the German states welcomed the ruling of the
Federal Constitutional Court. The reform's opponents, however, were
disappointed. Federal Minister of Education Juergen Ruettgers said he did
not like the spelling reform, but at least the case was decided now. In the
opinion of the member of parliament for the FDP, Mr Kleinert, the Federal
government did not have the right to introduce the new spelling rules
without consulting the Bundestag (the lower house of parliament). In the
state of Schleswig-Holstein, however, a referendum on the reform will take
place on September 27. The outcome of this referendum could still stop the
reform in this state.

</H1>
The five per cent hurdle in Saarland's local elections law
does not violate the state's constitution. The state's Constitutional Court
dismissed a case brought against that hurdle. The five per cent hurdle
prevents small parties from being elected to parliaments, and exists in the
local elections law of only six out of 16 German states.

German Rail to drastically reduce long-distance services
</H1>
Deutsche Bahn AG (German Rail) plans to drastically reduce its
long distance services, according to the Rail Union. Referring to internal
plans of Deutsche Bahn, a union's spokesperson said the company will cut 62
long distance services, and 47 other services, taking effect with the new
winter time table. Moreover, many services will not be offered any longer
on public holidays. The Interregio services are most affected by the cuts.
The union fears that 1,000 jobs will be slashed once the plans come into
effect. A Deutsche Bahn spokesperson refused to comment on the issue and
referred to next week's talks between Deutsche Bahn and the German states,
the latter being responsible for short distance services.
