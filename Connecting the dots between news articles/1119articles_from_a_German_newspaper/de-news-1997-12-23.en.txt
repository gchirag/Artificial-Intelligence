6 years 9 months prison sentence for Schneider
</H1>
In the process on the biggest bankruptcy in the German
real estate sector, property tycoon Juergen Schneider has been
sentenced to six years and nine months in prison. The Frankfurt
Regional Court found Mr Schneider guilty of serious fraud, credit
fraud and of forgery of documents. Mr Schneider had cleverly and
professionaly deceived the banks in order to obtain higher loans.
The "hardly imaginable negligence and recklessness" of the banks
when handing out loans to Mr Schneider had been taken to the
favour of the defendant. The court determined a father complex
as motive for Mr Schneiders action: he wanted to prove to his
Prussianly-strict father that he could be succesful in the
business world.

<P>
After the verdict had been pronounced, Mr Schneider has been
released for the time being, since the arrest order against him
had been revoked. The 2 1/2 year long arrest of Schneider during
the investigations will be counted towards his prison sentence.
It is still unclear when Mr Schneider will have to return to
prison to serve the remaining part of the sentence. The Public
Prosecutor's office filed a complained against the release of
Mr Schneider at the Hessian Higher Regional Court.

<P>
When Mr Schneider's real estate imperium collapsed in April
1994, the property tycoon had accumulated debts of DM5.4bn at
over 50 banks.
