CDU convention establishes party aims until next elections
</H1>
The CDU national convention in Erfurt set up aims for the party's
activities regarding internal affairs and party internal policy
between now and the next Bundestag elections. Among other things, they
want to see simple occupations exercised in a natural way.  New
concepts in working hours might result in new job openings.  Also, the
CDU proposes to fight for a policy of cost containment and reform of
social security

CDU delegates almost unanimous against employing ground forces
</H1>
Leading CDU politicians spoke out against the employ of ground
forces in the Kosovo war during the party's federal convention in
Erfurt. Chairman Schaeuble warned against a crawling escalation
of Bundeswehr action in the crisis-torn area. The Union would
be decidedly against any such attempt. NATO loyalty does not
mean indiscriminate subservience but asks for a point of view
of one's own. CDU vice-chairman Ruehe said invading Yugoslavia
would be an action without a mandate, gravely jeopardizing
chances for a political solution. The delegates agreed with this
stand almost unanimously.

<P>
CDU general secretary Ms. Merkel called on the SPD to stand
apart from PDS because of the latter's stand on the Kosovo war.
She holds it to be an impossible situation when Chancellor
Schroeder on the one hand talks about Western unity of values
and loyalty within the alliance while at the same time he admits
collaboration with PDS at the state level

Gerhardt against using German ground forces
</H1>
Meanwhile, FDP chairman Gerhardt also spoke out against German
ground troops for Kosowo. Speaking in Berlin, Gerhardt said that the
federal government must lay it down clearly to NATO allies that this
military option is out of the question for Germany.

Schroeder calls on his party to close ranks
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder called on the SPD to close ranks around the
Kosovo crisis. At a party workers' meeting in Bonn he strictly
repudiated demands from within SPD cadres for a change in
NATO strategy. This was just not the time to talk about a cease-fire,
he said. Schroeder went on saying that there must not be generated
an impression that the party didn't stand behind the government.
Voters especially would not show understanding for this. The
Bavarian SPD leadership's resolution on solving the Kosovo
conflict is dangerous, in Schroeder's opinion. Earlier, leading
East German social democrats had come out in favor of a
provisional cease-fire.

Annan's "Berlin speech"
</H1>
UN general secretary Annan will continue with his struggle to reach a
peaceful settlement for Kosovo. In his "Berlin speech" today, Annan
said a measure for conflict solution would be the quick return of
refugees to their homes. This would be victory for Europe, for the
UN.

<P>
At the same time, Annan appealed to the EU to provide a clear
perspective to East and Southeast European countries for
approaching and joining the Union. Many nations in the area feel
themselves excluded. The UN secretary general also spoke in favor
of a permanent seat in the UN security council for Germany. Within
the framework of an all-out reform of the UN, he would be in favor
of this.

EU intensifies Yugoslavia embargo
</H1>
The EU will intensify punitive measures against Yugoslavia. This was
decided by the foreign ministers conference in Luxembourg. Among
several planned measures are non-admission to European Union countries
for president Milosevic, his family, all ministers and other
representatives of Yugoslavia and Serbia, increased freezing of all
foreign assets which up to now were accessible to Yugoslav or Serbia's
governments, persons close to Milosevic and state controlled
companies. A ban on concession of credits to Yugoslav companies and on
expansion of Western investment will also get more teeth. An oil
embargo was decided at the end of last week politically and on
principle.  Starting next Friday, it will be implemented.

PDS launches Heinemann as candidate for president's office
</H1>
The PDS wants to propose Essen theologist Ranke-Heinemann
for the office of president. This was decided by the party leadership
in Berlin, backtracking on former intentions of not launching a
separate candidate at the election assembly May 23d. Their
explanation was that both Rau (SPD) and Schipanski (CDU) were
in agreement with NATO attacks on Yugoslavia.

Economic trend researchers believe in slower growth
</H1>
The six leading economic trend researching institutes
foresee slower economic growth for the current year.
They project a GNP growth against 1998 of somewhat
like 1.7%. With this, they are more optimistic than the
federal government; the ministry for finance estimated
economic growth for this year at no higher than 1.5%.
Henkel, chairman of the German confederation of
industries, blamed dwindling exports, reluctant
investments and unsatisfactory consumer demand for
the economic drop.
