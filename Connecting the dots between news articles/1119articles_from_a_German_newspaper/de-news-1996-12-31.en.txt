Chancellor Kohl's New Year Message
</H1>
In his traditional New Year Message Chancellor Helmut Kohl has called on
the German people to make more saving and reform efforts. He also
challenged the citizens to be prepared for radical changes. Germans could
not continue in the same way as they have so far without putting their
future at risk. According to Chancellor Kohl the new challenges are
international competition, restructuring of the welfare state, and European
unification. Germany will remain a rich country, but only if the right
decisions are made. Kohl stressed the importance of more effort to keep up
with increasingly stronger international competition. Germany will keep its
position as an export economy only if the necessary changes are
implemented. The Chancellor said: "We save to secure a good future for our
country and future generations." As the most important next steps Kohl
mentioned the planned tax reform and the restructuring of the welfare state.

Hamburg Bishop misses Christian values in German politics
</H1>
Bishop Maria Jepsen of Hamburg misses Christian values in German politics.
Although a high number of politicians are church members there was a lack
of Christian values in parliaments, Jepsen said in a newspaper interview.
The Bishop fears that the social coldness in Germany could create a
situation similar to that in the 20s and 30s because many people feel
powerless. The Church must show that people are not powerless. Jepsen
called on pastors in all congregations to become involved in current topics.

Threat of new federal budget block
</H1>
Federal ministries may have to prepare for another expenditure stop.
According to a report by the daily Bild-Zeitung Finance Minister Theo
Waigel is said to have advised the ministries to grant subsidies and
benefits only conditionally. Waigel is said to retain the right to recall
conditional subsidies. Already at the beginning of 1996 Waigel had blocked
the budget and all single expenditures of more than DM500,000 required his
approval.

<P>
The Finance Ministry, however, stated that the 1997 budget would start
without a budget block. According to the ministry, press reports referred
to normal administrative procedures and not to budgetary singularities.
