Discussions of Nolte's call to change abortion law
</H1>
After Federal Minister for the Families Claudia Nolte's call to
tighten up the abortion lesgislation (the so-called article 218),
two further members of parliament of the CDU/CSU faction have
voiced their support of her proposal. In the BILD tabloid, Mr Singhammer
(MP, CSU) has demanded a shortening of the period where abortions
are possible. Mr Hueppe (MP, CDU) suggested to restrict the number
of medical indications sanctioning an abortion.
<P>
Earlier, the Federal Minister of Justice, Mr Schmidt-Jortzig, has
spoken against changing the abortion legislation. The now valid
legislation had been the result of long discussions in parliament
and therefore should not be changed without need.
<P>
FDP secretary-general Guide Westerwelle called on Ms Nolte not to
question the compromise that had been so hard to find. Other FDP
politician as well as spokesperson of the SPD and the Greens rejected
Ms Nolte's proposal, too.
<P>
In support of her proposal, Ms Nolte had argued that the now valid
abortion legislation had to be questioned since the number of abortions
had not decreased since its introduction in 1994. The "pro familia"
organisation countered the minister's reasoning by pointing out that
the real number of abortion did not increase [since 1994]. Since the
legislation came into effect, just the number of unknown abortions
has decreased, because most abortions have been reported since then.

Westerwelle criticises "Freiburg circle"
</H1>
FDP secretary-general Guido Westerwelle has strongly criticised
the left-liberal "Freiburg circle" within the party. In his criticism
he expressly included leading FDP politicians. The secretary-general
urged these politicians, who he did not name, to consider the
consequences of such public statements. The FDP needed close ranks and
was not able to support the egoism of some members who just want to
distiguish themselves, Mr Westerwelle added.
<P>
Member of the FDP Executive Board Sabine Leuthaeuser-Schnarrenberger
had voiced her doubts in the Frankfurt Allgemeine newspaper whether
the heads of the party are up to their job.

Preussag to pay western wages in Ilsenburg
</H1>
Hardly two weeks before the announced strike in the East-German
metal sector the first company has given in to the demands of the
unions. Preussag Stahl AG has agreed to pay the 530 employees of
its Ilsenburg (Saxony-Anhalt) rolling mill the same wages as in
West-Germany.
<P>
The IG Metall union described Preussag's decision as a sign of reason
and called on the other East-German companies in the metal sector
to follow Preussag's step.
<P>
The sector's employers' association, however, said the situation
of the Preussag plant was different compared to other steel
producing companies in East-Germany. For the productivity in the
Ilsenburg plant has reached the level of comparable plants in
West-Germany and since it was one of two East-German plants in the
sector that was profitable.
