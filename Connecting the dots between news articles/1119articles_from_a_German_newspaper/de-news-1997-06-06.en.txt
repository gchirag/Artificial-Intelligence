Messrs Kohl and Blair to co-operate closely
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl told Prime Minister Blair that he really appreciated
being on top of the latter's visiting-list in Europa. Ten days before the
EU-summit at Maastricht, both heads of state wanted to discuss problems of
the EU-currency union and talk about the NATO-summit at the beginning of July,
in Madrid, and the G7-meeting in Denver. Previously Mr Blair had attended
a congress of the social-democratic party of Europe in Malmoe/Sweden. There
France and Great Britain had taken differing stands on how to lower
unemployment in Europe. France's Mr Jospin was for more market-controls,
boosting the public service and safeguarding existing situations. Mr Blair
expressly warned against superseded social-democratic recipes. He said it was
a fallacy to think that problems could be fixed by more spending and more
controls.

A day in the Upper House (Bundesrat)
</H1>
The Upper House (Bundesrat) decided against the 1999 tax-reform draft,
calling it unprofessional from a financial policy point of view, socially
unbalanced and off-target as far as the economy was concerned. On the other
hand, they passed the law on marital rape: after 20 years of discussion we
finally made it: all rapists will be treated the same.

<P>
Finance Minister Waigel wanted to lower tax-rates considerably, and give
all sorts of privileges and exemptions the chop, lowering the tax-payers'
burden by some 30 billion marks. The states claim that this would lower their
tax-take as well, and the draft would not do anything to better prospects
for investment and jobs. The draft will now return to parliament (Bundestag),
and as of July the Mediation Committee (between the two Houses) will do
their bit.

State ministers for internal affairs: spy on Scientology
</H1>
According to a decision by the state ministers for internal affairs
the Federal Intelligence Agency (Verfassungsschutz) is to watch the
contentious Scientology organisation, for a year. They are to find out if
"they are only a group of very unpleasant fellows, or if the organisation
is breaking criminal and/or constitutional law", according to Bavaria's
minister Beckstein. Baden-Wuerttemberg had already watched them for some
time, and found that they tried to get their hands on state and society. For
the time being there was no question of banning them. All ministers agreed
that there were suspicions the sect was against the free democratic base of
decision was passed unanimously. Scientology had already announced that they
intended to take the Domestic Intelligence Agency to court for spying on
them.
The ministers also decided on amending the contentious re-patriation system
of Bosnian refugees. Now Croats and Muslims who used to live in today's
Serbian Republic, are not to be sent back - for the time being.

Hardly any spring-revival in labour-market
</H1>
This spring's labour-market revival was one of the weakest ever.
Employment agencies recorded 91,200 less on the dole, lowering the total to
4.2 million, the smallest decline since 1991. Compared to last year's
figures, 440,000 more people were unemployed. The unemployment rate now
stands at 11.1%, compared to 11.3% in April (10.0% last May).

3.500 pigs destroyed in Baden-Wuerttemberg
</H1>
During the last few days Baden-Wuerttemberg ordered
3,500 pigs to be destroyed as they supposedly had swine-fever, though there
was no proof of the disease so far, according to the ministry of
agriculture. The authorities took samples and will use them to prove or
disprove suspicions. There is no cure for the disease and it is very
painful to the animals concerned. The disease is highly contagious, but
harmless to humans as they cannot become infected.

Doomed British import cattle to get reprieve for the time being
</H1>
Cattle imported from Britain will not be destroyed for the
time being, according to a decision by the Brandenburg Higher Administrative
Court. The killing had been ordered by federal government, reacting to the
BSE-disease. The court said that there were serious doubts that the animals
actually were carrying the disease. It also termed federal government's
decision as 'over the top': only 5 out of 5000 animals imported from Great
Britain had been diagnosed as suffering from BSE.

<P>
In May two fresh cases of BSE were registered in Switzerland, bringing this
country's total to 21 since the beginning of the year.

Pensioner detained in wake of letter-bomb attacks
</H1>
A 62-year old Austrian pensioner was arrested following a spate of
letter-bomb attacks in Austria and Germany. There were suspicions the
engineer wrote two fake letters taking responsibility for the offences,
though he refuted the claims. Austrian minister for internal affairs, Mr
Schloegel, previously had ruled out that the detained man would point the
authorities in the direction of the real criminals. Between 1993 and 1996,
four people died and more than a dozen were injured in the wake of a string
of letter-and pipe-bomb attacks in Germany and Austria.

Still no reason why fire destroyed Friedrichshafen home for asylum-seekers
</H1>
The public prosecutor would not rule out either arson
or negligence. One person died in the accident and 53 were injured, some of
them heavily.

<P>
So far careless handling of naked fires was thought to have been the cause
of another accident in a home for the disabled in Frankfurt/Oder. There eight
disabled women had died after they had inhaled toxic fumes, and nine more
residents had sustained heavy injuries.
