SPD accepts the introduction of the "great bugging attack"
</H1>
Today the parliamentary group of the Social Democrats in Bonn has
approved the introduction of the "grand bugging attack". According to
the parliamentary party leader Rudolf Scharping about 60 % of the MPs
have voted for the proposals and therefore the party would not try to
amend the proposals in parliament tomorrow. But the group will make it
clear that the provisions for those bound by oaths of
confidentiality (such as doctors or priests) ought to be improved. The
approval of the Social Democrats will secure the 66 % majority which is
necessary for constitutional changes.

Swine-fever in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania
</H1>
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania suffered another outbreak of swine-fever.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture in Schwerin more than 62.000
pigs had to be slaughtered on one farm in the county of Northwest-
Mecklenburg. This amounts to more than 10 % of the total pig population
in the north-eastern state. The causes for this outbreak are not yet
clear. The affected farm has delivered pigs to North Rhine-Westphalia,
Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein. All companies had contact with the
affected farm have been barred from trading. In one stable in Lower
Saxony about 320 animals have been killed already.

sector has been postponed to 27 January. According to participants the

number of apprenticeships, and part-time work during early retirement.

employers on the other hand want to cut down on sick pay and
supplementary company pension schemes.

Further delivery from the armed forces to right-wing group
</H1>
The Ministry of defence has donated two trucks from the armed forces to
a successor of the nazi "Waffen-SS". A spokesman of the Ministry said
the case which happened in 1996 was known and was investigated. The
program "Panorama" on German TV (ARD) claimed that the trucks were
delivered to the "Kameradenwerk Chorsteiner" (sp?), in which former SS
volunteers are organised. The Ministry gave humanitarian reasons for the
delivery. The "Kameradenwerk" had received the vehicles for war-graves
maintenance and a health centre in Estonia.
It has been known for some time that the armed forces gave scrap
vehicles and equipment to the right-wing terrorist Manfred Roeder. It
appears that this scandal triggered an investigation into the
"Kanmeradenwerk".
The public prosecutor's office also investigates extrem rightist
incidents in which soldiers from the army barracks in Farel and
Delmenhorst (both in Lower Saxony) are said to be involved.

</H1>

armed forces which the Minister of Defence, Volker Ruehe, has announced.
According to their spokesperson, Juergen Trittin, these events did
nothing to civilise the armed forces, but instead they brought society
closer to militarism. He called the events a bad Wilhelminian tradition,
which was also well loved by the nazis.
