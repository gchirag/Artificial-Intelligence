European Council meets in Strasbourg/France
</H1>
When the 40 heads of state met there, they mainly talked about civil rights,
not exactly up Mr Yeltzin's alley - who had never been to Strasbourg before.
All were welcomed by France's head of state, Mr Chirac, and especially so
Mr Yeltzin. The latter was and still is pretty contentious: civil rights are
not the flavour of the month there, in spite of all the declarations to the
contrary, and Russia still has capital punishment - though executions, for
the time being, have been suspended. Mr Yeltzin wanted to be a good European,
and that would have been one of the reasons why he stated that he would back
the ban on land-mines. He also wants to have more say in matters European,
and he already has had a bit of success in that department: today, together
with Chancellor Kohl and Prime Minister Chirac, he set up an exclusive club.
"My friend Jacques, Helmut Kohl and myself have decided to meet once a
year", he said, "as we've got the same problems we should handle them
together".

<P>
Mr Yeltzin's main concern is: he wants less influence by NATO and the US.
That's why he pushed his barrow for a big strong Europe, without any
demarcation-lines. This kind of Europe would be able to look after
themselves as far as security was concerned, according to the Russian head
of state.

Parliament passes bill on pension-reforms
</H1>
In spite of the opposition parties pulling all the stops while fighting the
bill on pension-reforms, parliament passed it all the same. The bill is
intended to prevent excessive hikes in contributions. The opposition
SPD-party criticised the bill as an attempt to rob pensioners. Labour
Minister Bluem, however, thought that the bill would balance the burden
between old and young. In a nutshell: from 1999 on pensions will not be
indexed to net wages only, they will also consider how many are how
old (the so-called demographic component). This will result in gradually
reducing pensions from currently 70% to 64% of net wages (based on 45 years
in employment). There will also be changes to the invalid benefit: you will
only get the full rate if you are unable to work 3 hours/day. As of July 1998,
there will be changes to how years spent on bringing up children are treated.
If you did not take the full 3 years of maternity/paternity leave you were
entitled to, 3 years will be added to your pension regardless. The factor
for this special leave will gradually go up from currently 75% to 100%.

<P>
So far no-one knows where the 15 billion marks for the higher federal
subsidy towards the compulsory state pension fund are to be found. Currently
the rate for the compulsory pension fund scheme is 20.3%, and that subsidy
is to lower it by 1%. The SPD-party will not agree to raising sales-tax, as
they are against the bill on pension-reforms. Consequently contributions
will rise from 20.3% to at least 20.6% as of next year.

Governing parties for better protection of children against sexual assault
</H1>
Stricter penalties and better therapy for offenders - that's how the
CDU/CSU-party and the Liberals want to better protect children against
sexual offenders. Less than a year after the tragic assault on little
Natalie of Epfach, citizens had collected signatures by the box-ful and
handed them to the speaker of parliament, Ms Suessmuth
(Bundestagspraesidentin).

<P>
In the future, aggravated sexual assault of children will attract a
prison-sentence between one and fifteen years, according to the governing
parties. So far the maximum is 10 years. If the child is killed in the
process, the maximum penalty can be for life. Judges may decide on
preventive detention for repeat-offenders.

<P>
The federal states are to extend therapy facilities within the next five
years. Penalties for certain property-related offenses will get lower,
in return. As Federal Minister of Justice Mr Edzard Schmidt-Jortzig said:
"To put it bluntly, we value personal rights such as life, health and sexual
integrity higher than property and economic interests. Consequently
penalties for the former went up, whereas they were lowered for the latter."

<P>
CSU-politician Gaus, however, emphasised that certain cases of aggravated
robbery attracted higher penalties now. The minimum penalty for an offender
who threatened their victim with a weapon, will rise to three years.

Mr Matthias Hinze possibly had drug-connections
</H1>
Matthias Hinze possibly had some drug-related involvement with his killers.
Allegedly he owed the two killers, from Russia, some 150,000 marks,
according to police sources. The kidnappers apparently had gone to extremes
to collect their money. They had held him captive for 4 weeks, in a hole in
the ground, where he finally had died of starvation or dehydration.

Power-cut hits Munich's Schwabing district
</H1>
Last night a power-cut made sure there was not a lot of (night-)life for half
an hour in Munich's Schwabing district. A total of 20,000 households were
affected, according to the city's Power Board. The power-cut was caused by
a short-circuit in one of the substations. Supposedly this also had some
far-reaching consequences: many other households in the Greater Munich area
were unable to watch cable-TV.
