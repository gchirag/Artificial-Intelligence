Reintroduction of capital gains tax
</H1>
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's proposal to leave the decision about
whether to reintroduce capital gains tax to the states has been met with
scepticism by SPD (Social Democratic Party) State Premiers.
North Rhine-Westphalia's State Premier, Wolfgang Clement, has taken a
position
against this tax. In an interview, he said that given the present state of
the economy, any debate about additional taxes is counterproductive. State
Premier Kurt Beck of the Rhineland-Palatinate warned in an interview with
ARD
TV of a finance political patchwork rug. Also for a unified solution for
all
of Germany said the State Premier of the Saarland, Mr. Klimmt. So
far, only the red-green coalition in Schleswig-Holstein is planning to
reintroduce capital gains tax.

Sunday sales fuel dispute about shopping hours
</H1>
In spite of trade unions' protests, many stores in Berlin, Dessau and
Halle
were open on Sunday. This was in reaction to the extension of store
opening hours in neighbouring Saxony. In Berlin, a new law has been in
effect
since he weekend. Parts of the inner city are declared tourist
attractions,
and in those areas, tourist articles may be sold on Saturdays and Sundays
until 7 p.m. The Office of Worker Protection has already levied a 50,000
DM
fine against a department store selling things that have nothing to do
with
tourism.

Problem at German Rail
</H1>
The ICE (Intercity Express) tracks between Fulda and Wuerzburg have been
reopened. The Landruecken tunnel near Fulda was closed on Sunday morning
because an engine driver had reported smoke. Fire fighters checked the
tunnel but could not detect a fire. It is likely that a train whirled up
dust
that settled on the tracks like smoke. Because of the closure of the
tunnel,
trains between Fulda and Wuerzburg were up to half an hour late.

Hofer arrested again
</H1>
German businessman Helmut Hofer has been arrested again in Iran. The
authorities have justified the step by saying that there is a danger that
Mr. Hofer could leave the country. Mr. Hofer was sentenced to death last
year for having slept with a Moslem woman. The Upper Court in Iran had
annulled the sentence at the beginning of the year and Mr. Hofer had been
allowed to leave jail on bail; he was not, however, allowed to leave the
country. It is presumed that re-arresting Mr. Hofer is a result of the
power struggle between the ultra conservatives and reform politicians
after the unrest in Iranian jails last week.
