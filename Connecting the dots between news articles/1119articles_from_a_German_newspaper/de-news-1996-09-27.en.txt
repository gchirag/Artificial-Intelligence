Upper House puts stop on planned reforms of public service employment laws
</H1>
The Upper House (Bundesrat) put a stop on planned reforms of public
service employment laws, as was expected. The draft had already been passed
by parliament (Bundestag). State premiers of both opposition and government
parties claimed, the reforms would not be far-reaching enough.
Amongst other things, they asked for managers to be on fixed-term contracts,
and they also wanted to reform pensions.
Federal minister for internal affairs, Mr Kanther, defended the law, stating
that the performance-incentives in the law gave it the edge. He now wants
to invoke the Mediation Committee between the two houses.

Upper House decides to move to Berlin
</H1>
Hesse's state premier, Mr Eichel, once again spoke out in favour of moving
the Upper House (Bundesrat) to Berlin. On radio Deutschlandfunk he said that
both houses have to co-operate closely, and that would be impossible if they
were in different cities. The decision, made in 1991, to keep the Bundesrat
in Bonn, had been made to do the former capital, Bonn, a favour. At the time
he had already voted for Berlin. As early as 1991, Bavaria and Bremen had
been for being close to the Bundestag, and government. That last argument
probably tipped the scales: today the Bundesrat decided to also move to
Berlin, a decision not all state premiers are too happy about.
Some select committees will stay in Bonn, and that would enhance Bonn's role
as bridge between Berlin and Brussels, and North and South.

Parliament debates on poverty in Germany
</H1>
The number of persons drawing social welfare benefits in Germany is growing,
though politicians took different views of this trend during today's
debate on poverty. Health minister Seehofer stated that poverty was not
rampant, and the opposition parties refuted that vigorously.
According to the opposition parties, the social safety net was not doing its
job any more. According to the SPD, government had pushed through 130 cuts to
it. Minister for family affairs, Ms Nolte, of the CSU, admitted that there
were people in Germany who needed help, but they were getting that. "Social
security and especially social welfare are meant to keep people from
becoming destitute through freak events, and they are our most important
weapons against poverty - and we all have to join ranks in that
respect. But solidarity is not a one-way street." Mr Seehofer agreed:
"The simple fix, namely hand out more and thus become more egalitarian,
socially, is wrong. Now the big challenge is to better target money for
people who want to help themselves, yet are unable to do so." But even for
them, social welfare benefits were not enough to guarantee a subsistence
level income, according to Mr Wolfgang Spanier, of the SPD. "If you look down
on things, from lofty heights, shrouded in history's cloak - to use a
metaphor - like our Chancellor, then obviously your vision will get
blurred." According to Mr Spanier, in Germany 2.5 million people rely on
income support, including a million children, 900,000 people had nowhere
to stay, and many did not earn enough to pay their way.

Disputes about lowering paid sick-leave
</H1>
Mr Zwickel, head of the metal-workers' union (IG Metall),
accused the employers of jeopardising the whole German industrial award
system. He said they wanted a fight with the unions, on purpose, about the
reduction of paid sick-leave, and there would eventually have to be strikes.
Daimler-Benz staff want to demonstrate on 1 October all over Germany, and
today there were stoppages involving several 1000 Mercedes workers.

Bosnian refugees about to be sent back
</H1>
A fortnight after the decisive conference of the state ministers for
internal affairs, Bavaria is getting ready for the so-called
re-patriation of Bosnian refugees, and the first lot are to leave as early
as 1 October. Some 20,000 singles and couples without children have to
leave Bavaria by next Tuesday, and they have already got their respective
'marching orders'. As Mr Beckstein, Bavarian minister for internal affairs,
said, they would not get a stay. He emphasised, however, that common
sense and non-compulsion should prevail. "We will only re-patriate a small
portion of them by force, viz. criminals and beneficiaries between the ages
of 18 and 55, who would be quite able and capable of doing a good job
when re-building Bosnia". Mr Beckstein emphasised that a stay of up to 6
months could only be considered for refugees now working in socially useful
jobs, for example registered nurses. Otherwise employers would have to prove
that they were unable to recruit someone else, or that they could not do
without the worker. Aged and sick persons would be able to leave after
winter. According to Mr Beckstein, Bavaria wanted to set a signal, yet
largely without using force.
