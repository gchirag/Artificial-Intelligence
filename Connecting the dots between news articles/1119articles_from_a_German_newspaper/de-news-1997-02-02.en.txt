Discussion about pension reform
</H1>
The CDU-Committee for the future of the social security systems
discussed the pension reform today in Windhagen. Minister of Employment,
Bluem, was presiding over the two-day conference. The basis was a report
which was presented to the government by the pension committee. The
committee suggested among other things to decrease the pension levels from
70 to 64 percent of the net wage by the year 2030. Pensions for child
raising services will be financed by tax money from a new family plan
agency. The contribution rate of 20.3 percent will decrease during the
next
few years and then increase to 23 percent. The suggestions are
controversial among members of the CDU and especially its coalition
partner
FDP, yet they are supported by social politicians of the union parties.

Ruland: Warning about another decrease of fees for social security
</H1>
The director of the Association of German Pension Insurance Agencies,
Ruland, warned against a further decrease of the contribution rate for
social security. Ruland told the radio station "Deutschlandfunk" that
contributions can hardly by pushed under the 20 percent mark because
otherwise the gap between pensions and welfare will become too small.
Ruland attributed the current financial situation of social security to
political mistakes. He emphasized that last year's limited contribution
rate as well as the use of pension funds for not insurance related
services
are responsible for this situation. At the same time, he welcomed the
introduction of a so-called family plan agency as a start to relieve
social
security.
