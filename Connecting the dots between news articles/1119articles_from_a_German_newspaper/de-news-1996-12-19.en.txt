Federal states halt reform plans for vehicle tax and employment measures
</H1>
The states have stopped an attempt by the Coalition of Bonn to overhaul the
vehicle excise tax and employment measures.  In its last session before the
Christmas break, the Bundesrat referred the matter of the vehicle excise tax
to the mediation committee, since the bill does not adequately offset the
losses in the states' tax revenue.  As to the employment measures, the SPD
run states, but also CDU representatives opposed cuts in a federal program
(ABM) promoting employment, especially in East Germany.  Other coalition
bills as well, like health reform and cuts in sick pay for officials, were
rejected by the Bundesrat.  On the other hand, green light was given for the
1997 budget bill, despite criticism in several, singular points.  Furthermore
the controversial tax law 1997 was passed.  The SPD negotiator, Hamburg's
mayor Mr. Vorscherau said on Deutschlandradio Berlin that the states didn't
have a choice.  Through the abolition of the tax on cash assets, the states
will suffer losses of billions of DM, which would not be compensated for if
the bill was rejected, Voscherau continued.  In that context, he mentioned
the hike in inheritance tax and the tax on property transactions.  Voscherau
again criticized the tax and financial policy of the Coalition as
single-sided, bearing down particularly hard on low-income families.

No evidence for guilt on the part of Rita Suessmuth
</H1>
A preliminary examination of the air travel itineraries of the President of
Parliament, Ms. Suessmuth, has apparently failed to yield any evidence for
misuse.  The parliamentary vice president, Mr. Klose, said a final evaluation
is only possible after a detailed inspection.  He noted that it doesn't take
a press release by the SPD to mount activity within the CDU/CSU.  The SPD had
mentioned indiscretion from within the CDU/CSU which had made Rita Suessmuth
stumble.  Helmut Kohl issued an immediate response through his press
spokesman saying that nobody of the CDU leadership wanted to harm Rita
Suessmuth.  The head of the CDU parliamentary group, Wolfgang Schaeuble, also
came to protect Ms. Suessmuth.  He said he has no doubts that she used the
air force exclusively for official purposes.

Suessmuth obtains injunction against Springer Corporation
</H1>
Parliamentary President Ms. Suessmuth has obtained an injunction against the
Springer publishing house at the Hamburg Regional Court in an urgency
decision.  The press office of the Bundestag informed in Bonn tonight that in
seven cases, the Springer Corporation has been prohibited to assert the
Parliamentary President had used the air force VIP transportation unit for
personal purposes this year and last year.  Due to the special criteria for
urgency decisions in conflicts involving the press law, Ms. Suessmuth had
limited her request to seven cases of false assertions.  It was said,
however, that she wants to legally pursue accusations regarding other alleged
private flights to Switzerland as well.
