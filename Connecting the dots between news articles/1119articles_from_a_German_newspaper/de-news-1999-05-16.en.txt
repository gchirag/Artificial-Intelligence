Italian prime minister presents peace plan for Kosovo
</H1>
Dalema, Italian prime minister, has presented a new peace plan for
Kosovo. His suggestions, according to the newspaper "La Republica",
include a one-sided cease-fire, the condition being that Russia and China
vote against Milosevic in a UN resolution. Mr. Dalema suggested that NATO
ground troops should be sent in if, after a cease-fire, the Yugoslav
President still doesn't withdraw his troops from Kosova. Mr. Shay, NATO
spokesman, said that the Alliance welcomed all diplomatic activities
towards finding a peaceful solution to the conflict. All NATO states
would however carry on supporting the air raids until Milosevic gave in,
continued Mr. Shay. However, the peace plan put forward by Mr. Dalema was
welcome.

allowing possible exceptions.

State party conference of SPD in Bavaria
</H1>
The SPD in Bavaria's state party conference continued with an
appeal from Mr. Ude, Mayor of Munich, for party members to keep party
affairs private. Mr. Ude said that the SPD cannot allow itself to be
divided into modernist and traditionalist groups. Mr. Hanzog, a state
parliamentarian, had previously tried to get onto the agenda a renewed
vote regarding the operation in the Kosovo. The board had rejected this
application saying that a new party conference would be necessary to
discuss such an item. To conclude the party conference, party delegates
plan to reach a decision as regards a referendum opposing six levels at
