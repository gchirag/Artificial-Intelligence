Small party conference of the Bavarian Greens
</H1>
The war in Kosovo took up most of the small party conference of the Bavarian
Greens. The debate inside the party was heated. Demands ranged from an
immediate cessation of the bombing to calls for a large-scale invasion by
ground troops.

<P>
Party chief Montag defended the air strikes on Yugoslavia.  He said,
"Whoever places his hands in his lap where victims of violence might be
saved is himself guilty." Undersecretary of State Ludger Volmer explained
that a stop to the bombing would not improve matters because the murders in
Yugoslavia would continue. Volmer conceded that NATO air strikes had not
yet attained their goal.

<P>
A resolution is supposed to be approved at this conference that supports the
peace plan of Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer while also calling for a
temporary cease fire.
