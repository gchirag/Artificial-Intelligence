Justice Committee discusses sexual abuse crimes
</H1>
The question of what to do with perpetrators of sexual abuse was
discussed at a hearing held by the Bundestag lower house's Parliamentary
Justice Committee today. Experts called for more and better
opportunities for therapy for the perpetrators, emphasising that
treatment for the perpetrators also meant protection for their potential
victims. The experts saw no merit in longer sentences. The so-called
"chemical castration" also was useful merely as the first step towards a
therapy and without effect if used as an isolated measure, the experts
continued. They were also critical of the practice of early parole: the
major factor in granting parole was good behaviour, and perpetrators of
sexual abuse often were very good at fitting in. The likelihood of
further sexual abuse on the other hand was looked at far less often in
granting parole, mainly because only a small fraction of all
perpetrators received any psychiatric care, the experts said.
Several politicians had recently called for more draconian laws on
sexual abuse after a seven-year-old called Natalie had been murdered by
a previously convicted sexual abuse perpetrator.

"Gesamtmetall" VP labels 1997 wage claims "blind to reality"
</H1>
Vice President of the "Gesamtmetall" metal industry employers'
association Dieter Hundt has rejected the "IG Metall" trade union's
claims for the 1997 round of wage bargaining talks, labelling them
"blind to reality". In a newspaper interview, Hundt said labour costs
had to be lowered in order for businesses to stay competitive. If a
drastic reduction of secondary labour costs was able to be achieved,
basic incomes could largely be spared, Hundt added. Furthermore the cuts
to paid sick leave were a substantive step towards saving jobs, he
continued.
Yesterday, the "IG Metall" executive had demanded a 5% wage increase for
the coming round of talks. However, the union is prepared to accept no
increase at all provided that meaasures guaranteeing employment are
written into the agreements.

"IG Metall" apparently ready for compromise over paid sick leave
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg regional head of the "IG Metall" metal and
engineering workers' union Zambelli has signalled readiness to reach a
compromise in the question of cuts to paid sick leave. In an interview
with the daily "Leipziger Volkszeitung", Zambelli said a return to the
traditional form of paid sick leave was inconceivable. A possible way to
calculate it could be the working hours prescribed by the bargaining
agreement, excluding over-time.
Meanwhile, "IG Metall" president Zwickel corroborated the union's view
that full 100% paid sick leave had to be maintained ahead of the
negotiations on the matter in the metals and engineering industry, due
to start tomorrow.

Commission of the EU wanted to suppress BSE debate in Germany
</H1>
Two years ago, the EU Commission apparently tried to put
pressure on the Federal Government in order to stifle the fledgling
debate in Germany on the dangers of the "mad cow disease" BSE. Head of
the Berlin Federal Institute for Health-related Consumer Protection and
Veterinary Science Somogi today told the relevant committee of the
European Parliament of a corresponding letter. He alleged that in said
letter the Director General of the EU Commission had demanded of the
Bonn Health Ministry to stop disconcerting consumers over BSE.

Another billion-mark gap in federal budget
</H1>
Further billions are missing in the current federal budget.
Unsuccesful privatisations, for instance of the "Lufthansa" state
airline, are to blame. The admission was made for the first time
by the Finance Ministry in a report to the Bundestag's Parliamentary
Budget Committee, released today. Originally, Finance Minister Waigel
had wanted to achieve a goal of 9 billion marks through privatisations
carried out this year. The funds were supposed to be used for filling
gaps in the budget. The SPD Social Democrats voiced their criticism,
saying that Waigel's admission that the funds were not to be counted on
anymore had come too late.

Health insurers considering suit against planned cost-cutting law
</H1>
The Employees' Health Insurance Funds organisation is seeking
legal advice on bringing a suit against the new law tying contribution
increases to higher excess rates. In a newspaper interview, the
organisation's head Rebscher said such a coupling was not only a
punishment for the ill, but also highly worrying legally.
Tomorrow, the Bundestag will debate the third stage of the health care
reform. A transition statute, already coming into force today, was
included in the draft law. It states that patients will be required to
pay higher excess whenever the health insurers raise their payment
scales.

SPD wants rise in health insurance contribution cut-offs
</H1>
The SPD wants to make it a requirement for more people to join the
statutory health insurance scheme. The Social Democrats are also calling
for a rise in the possible maximum contributions in order to stabilise
the health insurers' financial position. Health policy spokesperson of
the SPD parliamentary faction Kirschner said the contribution assessment
ceiling and the statutory insurance cut-off point should be raised from
now 6,000 marks monthly income (West) and 5,100 marks (East) to 8,000
and 6,800 marks respectively, bringing them in line with those
applicable to the pensions insurance. This alone would bring about a
possible decrease of the average contribution payment by .6%. It would
be an act of social equity to enlarge the group of compulsorily insured
people in the face of the current problems experienced by the statutory
health insurance scheme, Kirschner added.

Luebeck arson trial: still unclear where fire started
</H1>
In the trial over the devastating fire at a Luebeck asylum
seeker refuge last January it is still not clear where exactly the fire
started. Today, fire crews supported the defence argument that the fire
had started on the ground floor. It was possible that the arson had been
committed by someone else, the defence said. Experts called by the
Federal and State Criminal Investigations Bureaus however had said the
fire had started inside the building and had spread from the first floor
throughout the house. The public prosecutor accuses Lebanese citizen
Safwan Eid of having started the fire deliberately on the first floor.

Merger of SDR and SWF public broadcasters to be expedited
</H1>
The state governments of Baden-Wuerttemberg and
Rhineland-Palatinate are determined to fast-track the reform of the
public broadcasting system in Germany's Southwest. After an initial
meeting between the State Premiers of the respective states, Teufel and
Beck, the two men announced they were in agreement that the broadcasting
landscape should show better performance, should make savings in the
staff and equipment sectors possible, and thus increase the quality
of programs. The question of where the future headquarters will be was
deliberately kept out of today's talks. However, the politicians said
that "a fair balance between Stuttgart, Mainz and Baden-Baden" had to be
found. The Program Directors or "Intendanten" of SDR and SWF were asked
to work on and present ready-to-be-approved plans for programs and
frequencies.
