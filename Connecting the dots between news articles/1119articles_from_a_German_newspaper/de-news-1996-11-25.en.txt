Wage negotiations for metal workers in North Rhine-Westphalia
</H1>
The contract negotiations for workers in the North Rhine-
Westphalia metal industry started today. Employers are aiming at an agreement
that would apply to the metal industry nationwide. Two previous attempts to
reach an agreement failed because of the controversy surrounding sick pay.
The IG Metall union insists on keeping the current regulation of 100 percent
of wages as sick pay. A spokesperson said that a vacation day adjustment also
was not an option. The talks in the industry's largest negotiation district
are seen as the final attempt to reach a solution that could be applied in
the rest of the country.

today. The Food and Restaurant Workers' Union (NGG) called on almost 4000
employees of four major companies to go on strike. 97 percent of union

October. This is the first branch to take strike action regarding the sick
pay dispute.

Only a third of all companies train apprentices
</H1>
According to the Federal Employment Bureau, only a third of all
companies in Germany train apprentices. The Bureau's president, Mr. Jagoda,
accused industry leaders of failing to do enough for the next generation.
According to Mr. jagoda, the service industry has a particularly high deficit
in providing apprenticeships, even though two thirds of all potential
apprentices want to work there. Trade employers are an exception: with a 20
percent share of the total job count, they offer more than twice that in
apprenticeships.

SPD special convention on youth issues
</H1>
The Social Democratic Party discussed its relationship with the
young generation at a special convention titled "Contract with the future --
new opportunities for young people." Many speakers demanded more rights for
political participation for young people as well as an improved job training
policy. 
<P>
The delegates voted on a tax for companies which don't train young
workers. The money thus collected should go into a special fund to create new
apprenticeship positions. The minister president of Lower Saxony and the
economy minister of North Rhine-Westphalia had cautioned against such a tax,
stating that it would increase bureaucracy and the cost of labor and was
absurd and counterproductive.

<P>
The convention also clearly rejected plans to introduce college tuition. In
addition, the motion rejected government plans to force recipients of student
loans to prove their progress. The convention voted to allow 16-year-olds to
vote and called on the party to finally realize an earlier decision in this
regard.

<P>
By improving its image and winning young supporters, the SPD is trying to
regain lost ground. The effort is urgently needed as only 14 percent of the
party members belong to the young generation, a development similar to that
of the FDP and the CDU/CSU.

EU continues dialogue with Iran
</H1>
The European Union plans to continue its so-called "critical
dialogue" with Iran. EU foreign ministers passed a declaration proposed by
Germany. Foreign minister Klaus Kinkel said the European ministers had proven
their solidarity with Germany and that they would continue to communicate
with the Iranian government regarding human rights, aggressive
fundamentalism, and terrorism. Talks with the Iranian leadership are
scheduled to continue on Friday.

Hintze: Let 1997 annual tax law fail if necessary
</H1>
The Christian-Democratic Union wants to let the 1997 annual tax law fail
finally if the Social-Democrats don't make concessions in the current
mediation proceedings. Bundestag and Bundesrat would not call the mediation
committee another time, said CDU secretary-general Peter Hintze. Then, the
SPD would be responsible for negative effects on state budgets. The CDU
leadership insisted on complete abolition of asset tax and local capital
trade tax. Hintze added that it was unlikely that parts of the tax reform,
apart from reducing solidarity tax, would be advanced to 1998. This, however,
was the demand of the FDP.

Henkel confirmed as industry president
</H1>
Hans-Olaf Henkel has been confirmed by a large majority as president of the
Federal Association of German Industries (BDI). The members convention was in
favour of extending his term by two years. Investigations by the Prosecution
against the 56-year-old, who was suspected of aiding and abetting in tax
evasion, had caused speculations about a change in the BDI leadership. Henkel
said he wants to stay in office for a full term.

Italian Lira back in European Exchange Rate Mechanism
</H1>
After four years the Italian Lira has returned to the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM). After difficult negotiations, finance ministers and central
bank chiefs of the 15 member countries set the base ratio of Lira and
Deutschmark to 990:1000. Especially the German government, supported by
France, insisted on a ratio of under 1000 Lira. Italy wanted a higher rate to
boost their export economy. The return of the Italian currency to the ERM is
a fundamental condition for participation in the European Monetary Union
planned for 1999. German central bank president Hans Tietmeyer said the readmission was not a decision-in-advance about admittance to Monetary Union.

French truckers block border crossings
</H1>
Striking French lorry drivers have blocked five border crossings to Germany
and ferry connections to Great Britain. A German Border Guard spokesperson in
Kehl stated drivers were blocking the Strasbourg Europe Bridge and other
crossings. Apparently, only cars were allowed to pass. The trucker unions
demand from French trucking companies shorter work hours and higher wages.

<P>
Mediation negotiations in the French Transportation Ministry in Paris were
adjourned this morning after 14 hours without reaching a result. In Burgundy,
a German lorry driver was seriously injured when he tried to break a road
block by French colleagues. Traffic was being blocked in more than 1000
places all over France.

New hazardous waste scandal in Rhineland-Palatinate
</H1>
Another hazardous waste scandal has been discovered in Rhineland-Palatinate.
Police and prosecution searched more than 20 locations in six federal states.
One suspect was arrested. A Sprentling company is at the centre of the
investigations. It is suspected of not having separated hazardous waste but
having sent it to refuse pits and incineration plants in several states. At
the same time, poisonous substances were relabelled and disposed of as
domestic waste. According to the prosecution, the company has probably evaded
paying millions of marks in hazardous waste fees through its deceptive
disposal.

Federal Minister of Employment Norbert Bluem assured today that the
Federal government does not plan to cut pensions. He denied press reports
that claim he intends to cut payments for longer-living pensioners. The
minister added, people should not be made to worry, or else everybody would
think part of their old-age pension would be taken away. Now, the one and
only issue was be the degree of future pension increases, Bluem said.

Legal adviser of IG Metall union resigns
</H1>
The legal adviser of IG Metall union, Mr Kittner (sp?)
resigned from his post today after it had become known that the resigned
President of Hesse's Supreme Court, Mr Heinrichs, was paid Dm1.34mio in fees
for an expert opinion by the union. According to Mr Kittner, he resigned
because he had left union heads in the dark about the scale of the payments.

<P>
Mr Heinrichs headed a fact-finding committee appointed by the union to
investigate disputed real estate deals. The committee found chaos,
incompetence and disinformation at union offices. Last week, Mr Heinrichs
resigned as President of Hesse's Supreme Court. Meanwhile, he is pushed by
politicians to resign from his post as President of Frankfurt's Higher
Regional Court, too. This, however, would cause him to lose all his state
pension benefits.
