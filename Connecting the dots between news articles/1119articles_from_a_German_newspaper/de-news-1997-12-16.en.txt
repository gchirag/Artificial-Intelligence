ceiling and wall panels. The court found that the fire had been caused by
welding works on the roof of the arrival hall. The company that carried out
the welding must pay at least DM5 million compensation. Seventeen people

Schneider trial: Defence demands 5 3/4 years
</H1>
Defence lawyers of real estate manager Juergen Schneider have asked for a
punishment of five years and nine months. In the trial before the Frankfurt
Regional Court, Schneider's lawyers argued again that the banks were partly
accountable for exaggerated credits. Especially the Deutsche Bank was
hardly a pawn of Schneider's deceptions. Rather, the executives had
intentionally disregarded the protective legal wall against credit risks.
On Friday, the prosecution had demanded seven years and nine months for
Schneider. The court will hand down the verdict a week from today.

tax affairs in top management. In a personal statement today he made the

to this decision after serious thought. The successor to 61-year-old
Sarrazin has alreay been announced as the board member Mr Walther. The
management of the second largest German bank had been in the headlines
since September. Two board members reported themselves for tax evasion  and

Prosecution demands life sentence for murder of Natalie
</H1>
In the trial for the murder of seven-year-old Natalie Astner, the state
attorney has demanded life imprisonment for the accused. Speaking before
the Augsburg State court, the senior attorney said that the 29-year-old
accused had without doubt deliberately killed Natalie, in order to hide his
sexual abuse
of her. The crime was particularly severe. This would make a release after
a fifteen year sentence difficult. The defence lawyer made no plea on the
sentence. He appealed to the court, however, to provide an effective
therapy for the accused. The court had previously denied access to a third
expert opinion. The accused had pleaded guilty to all accusations. The
judgement will be made tomorrow.
