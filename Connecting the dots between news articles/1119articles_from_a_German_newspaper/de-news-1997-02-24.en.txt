First tax reform talk without results
</H1>
The first talk about tax reforms among top representatives of the
government and the opposition ended after three hours without
convergence. However, the governing coalition and the SPD agreed to
have further talks this week. Experts of the Federal and the North
Rhine-Westphalian Ministries of Finance will talk about their different
figures concerning the tax reform. North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister of
Finance Schleusser estimates the financing gap at 74 billion DM, while
Federal Minister of Finance Waigel thinks it will be only 44 billion DM.

<P>
FDP chairman Gerhardt said the governmental coalition strives for an
agreement with the Social Democrats before Easter. The coalition and
the SPD hold opposing positions concerning the tax reform. The
coalition's main goal is to lower the maximum tax rate and to introduce
taxes on the additional payments for shift-work. The Social Democrats
want to prevent that. CDU, CSU and FDP depend on the cooperation of the
SPD - crucial parts of the tax reform have to be approved by the
Bundesrat, the upper house of the parliament where the states with a
SPD government have a majority.

<P>
After the tax summit Chancellor Kohl and Lafontain met for a talk about
coal policies.

NATO and Russia discuss security charter
</H1>
In the discussions about the security charter between the NATO and
Russia that began today, four propositons offered to NATO general
secretary Solana by Russian Foreign Minister Primakov will be examined.
This was indicated outside the negotiations between Russian experts and
representatives of the western defence alliance in Brussels.

<P>
The charter is intended to make it easier for Russia to accept the
extension of the NATO towards the East. The influence that Moscow can
have on the alliance's decisions is disputed. It is said that,
following Primakov's proposition, a NATO-Russia council might be
founded in the Belgian capital, where problems could be solved by the
members as partners with equal rights.

Quarrel among CDU and CSU about the local trade tax on capital
</H1>
The CDU and the CSU still argue about the local trade tax on capital.
After a meeting of the parliamentary secretary of state in the Ministry
of Finance, Hauser, and Eastern German members of parliament for the
CDU, there was still some doubt whether the CDU/CSU faction will pass
the draft bill to abolish this tax on January 1, 1998. According to the
Unification Contract,
the local trade tax on capital should have been introduced in the
eastern part of Germany as well. As the governing coalition intends to
abolish this tax completely by the end of the year, the measure had
been postponed.

cities visited the Wehrmacht exhibition. It documents crimes comitted
by the Wehrmacht during World War II. Critics accuse the exhibition's
organizers for defaming Wehrmacht soldiers in a biased way.

Railroaders' union encourages preference of railroads
</H1>
In a reaction to reports of unprofitable local lines, the railroaders'
union calls for an increasing transfer of transportation to railroads.
In Frankfurt/Main, the union's deputy chairman Hansen said that those
who let railroad lines fall to pieces today would have to build new
roads tomorrow. He appealed to the state governments to start
negotiations with the Bahn [Germany's railroad company] because many
lines could maintain services with only little extra expense.

<P>
The Verkehrsclub Deutschlands [German Transportation Club] pleaded for
the complete regionalization of all local lines and called on federal
and state governments to commit more strongly to this issue.
