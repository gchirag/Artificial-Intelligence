Coalition agrees on reform and austerity package
</H1>
The government coalition has agreed on the tax, family and pension
package, said Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The tax burden of companies
and families will be  reduced. For example, the tax deduction for
children will be raised by 2000 DM to 10.000 DM next year. Originally,
an increase by 3000 DM had been targeted. In addition the child benefit
will be increased by 20 DM to 270 DM per month. The coalition parties
also approved the austerity package of Finance Minister Hans Eichel that
will be adopted by the Cabinet tomorrow. For the next two years, the
pensions will increase only at the rate of the inflation. There will be
no obligatory private insurance but a voluntary private insurance will
be enabled. Mr. Schroeder confirmed that life insurance based on a
capital gain scheme will not be taxed for the time being. Another
controversial tax exemption, required gastronomic expenses, will remain
exempt.
The opposition parties CDU/CSU and FDP criticized the austerity package.
CDU leader Wolfgang Schaeuble said there were signs of a looming
gigantic election fraud by the red-green coalition in the areas of
budget, taxes, pensions, and health. FDP secretary-general Guido
Westerwelle demanded that Federal Labour Minister Walter Riester resign.

Coalition agrees on eco tax schemes
</H1>
Gasoline prices will increase by 6 Pf. annually until 2003.
Electricity prices will increase by 0.5 Pf./kWh annually. This is the
result of an agreement by Social-Democrats and Buendnis90/Gruene. The
additional appropriations will flow into the pension fund to reduce the
pension contributions. SPD and B90/G have calculated that this way the
pension contributions could be reduced by 2.3 percentage point until
2003.

No agreement in energy consensus talks
</H1>
In the latest round of energy consensus talks, the federal
government and leading German power utilities did not reach an
agreement. The industry retracted the cornerstone document that provided
a total life time for nuclear power plants of 35 years. The utilities
now demand to calculate actual years of use instead of calendar years,
said Environment Minister Juergen Trittin. The differences will be
discussed at the next meeting that has not been scheduled yet.

Trial against Hofer adjourned
</H1>
In Iran, the new trial against businessman Hofer has been
adjourned for a number of weeks. Due to the nonappearance of a court
translator, the judge scheduled the proceedings to resume the 11th of
August. According to him, the next appearance would normally have been
scheduled in seven months time. However, he did not want to make Hofer
wait that long.
A representative of the German embassy professed himself outraged by the
new delay. In the meantime Hofer is without income and dependent on
German welfare. At the beginning of last year he was condemned to death
for the alleged sexual relationship with a Muslim woman. In April he was
released on bail after the Supreme Court lifted the death sentence in
February.

Health insurance companies' death benefits to continue
</H1>
Death benefits from state health insurance companies will
apparently not be abolished. The German news agency hopes they will be
preserved. In Bonn the last few days, there was talk that death benefits
would be abolished, in order that health insurance companies could keep
their contributions stable. Members of state health insurance companies
receive up to 2,100 DM at the death of a family member, as a
contribution towards the cost of burial.

Volkswagen lowers planned sales
</H1>
Volkswagen will build less cars than planned this year. All
extra shifts will be struck. This was announced to the employees in
Wolfsburg by the Volkswagen concern. The reason given, was the increased
competition in the European car industry. As was further announced, more
Volkswagen cars will nonetheless roll of the production line this year
than in 1998. In the view of the factory committee, the 6000 restricted
employees now run less of a risk of a complete take-over.
