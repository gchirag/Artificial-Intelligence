Opinions clash over Mueller's economic policy proposals
</H1>
CDU politician Wissmann welcomed econcmy minister Mueller's proposal
for restructuring economic policies. Speaking to radio
"Deutschlandfunk", Wissmann qualified his opinion by saying that it
was not sufficient to formulate well-phrased proposals unless they
were followed by corresponding actions. To be consistent, the
government would also have to take back their reform in the health
area and rethink their fiscal policies. Lowering the government's
gross tax bite, and non-homogeneous wage policies were singled out by
the CDU politician as steps in the right direction.  Unions, on the
other hand, rejected the minister's proposals offhand, callimg them
bad economic policy and socially unbalanced, in the opinion of the
white collar workers'union DAG. The labor federation DGB warned
against a change of course impairing workers and employees.

Hesse's minister of justice demands convicts to remain in prison
</H1>
Hesse's state minister for justice Wagner demanded basic changes in
the laws of penal execution. Re-socializing the perpetrators must not
be
the law's foremost concern, said the CDU politician in Wiesbaden.
He wants to see convict time done in prison as a rule. The law in
question was by now 22 years old and tainted by a number of "socially
romanticized assumptions" (sic), the minister said. An equilibrium
between "re-socialization" and "protection of citizens" as main
aims of penal execution must be reestablished.
