Pension reform meets with internal criticism
</H1>
Labor Minister Blum's proposed reforms for the Pension Commission have
met with internal criticism. Mr. Miegel, an economist and a member of the
Pension Commission, believes that the proposed reform would slowly
disenfranchise young people. He has rejected the proposal, stating that it
does not take into account a change in the population or a changed labor
market.
He has the impression that the younger generation will be shortchanged with
this model. They would be asked to carry an unreasonable burden. For this
reason, and the fact that the actual financing has not been clarified, he
felt obligated to vote against it. The commission presented a concept
yesterday that would reduce pension payments from the current rate of 70
percent to 64 percent of net income by the year 2030, due to changes in the
population.
Services not covered by insurance such as payments to parents on leave from
work to raise their children would be paid from a new family fund financed by
taxes.
Westerwelle stated that the proposed reform should not and would not become
governmental policy. The 40-year olds of today should receive the lowest
pension payments, and the 20-year olds should pay the highest pension
contributions. This policy places the burden on the next generation. It
breaks solidarity and is not good for social welfare.

Otto extortionist arrested
</H1>
Michael Otto, president of the world's largest mail order company,
has been making extortion payments for the past 10 days. Police arrested a
50-year old man when a payment of two and a half million Marks was delivered.
The money, packed in a suitcase, was to be thrown from a moving train when a
radio signal was received. The extortionist had selected the local
Luebeck-Kiel train. The signal was received shortly after 7:00 p.m. and the
suitcase was thrown from the train. But hundreds of policemen, supported by a
mobile SWAT team, stood waiting along the route. The extortionist was
apprehended as he made his move to retrieve the suitcase. He made a full
confession that night.
The extortionist had threatened to blow up Mr. Otto with a car bomb if he had
not made the payments. Mr. Otto is the richest, but also the best protected
millionaire in Hamburg.

Kinkel rejects criticism of Germany
</H1>
Foreign Minister Kinkel has rejected America's criticism of Germany
for its measures against the Scientology organization. At a party meetingin
Munich he claimed that the accusations are completely unjustified and have no
solid basis. The German government's position is clear, he stated.
Scientology, according to decisions reached by Germany's highest courts, is
not a religious organization, but rather a for-profit agency.
The most recent report issued by the U.S. State Department on the worldwide
state of human rights accuses Germany of discrimination against Scientology
members.
At the same time, however, State Department spokesman Mr. Burns reported that
the Scientology organization had run an exaggerated campaign against the
German government.

Non-word of the year
</H1>
The non-word of the year is "Rentnerschwemme" (glut of retirees),
according to a committee of language critics and writers.
The terms "Sparpaket" (savings package, i.e. budget cuts),
"Rechtschreibreform" (spelling reform) and "Kids" received the greatest
number of votes, but the committee selected the term "Rentnerschwemme".
Horst Dieter Schloesser, a professor of German Language and Literature and
spokesman for the Non-Word Committee, explained their selection as follows
The image communicated by this term conveys an incorrect and inhumane
impression. It attempts to describe the growing number of citizens who will
file claims for social security, but sounds like an unpredictable natural
catastrophe against which we may have to protect ourselves, even using
unpopular means.
Runners-up for non-word of the year included: "Flexibilisierung",
(flexibilization), "Outsourcing", "Umbau des Sozialstaates", (restructuring
of the social state), "Gesundheitsreform" (health care reform) and
"Sozialhygiene" (social hygiene).
