Chances increasing for agreement of coalition on budget policy
</H1>
Chances that the government coalition will agree on a budget and tax policy
are apparently improving. FDP secretary-general Guido Westerwelle said
negotiations are well under way. At tomorrow's talks, FDP and Finance
Minister Theo Waigel will present suggestions and numbers that the factions
can discuss during the rest of the week. According to the coalition, they
will strive for a mixture of privatizations, cuts, and new debts.
Meanwhile, Mr. Westerwelle rejected even hidden tax increases. He was
reacting to statements by Union faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble who said
the coalition was prepared to implement parts of the Great Tax Reform as
soon as 1998. The daily Bild had reported Tuesday morning the coalition
partners had agreed not to increase taxes and to stay with the reduction of
the solidarity surcharge but to implement parts of the tax reform earlier.
According to Bild the coalition wants to drastically curtail tax advantages
for large companies.

<P>
SPD leader Rudolf Scharping criticized those plans. He said it was a
dramatic wrong decision to start now with putting stress on companies.
Targeted tax advantages to be cut include the carrying forward or backward
of losses applying to corporation tax and cuts of reserve funds of energy
companies for nuclear waste disposal.

Germany does agree to employment chapter in Maastricht II
</H1>
Germany is now prepared to accept the inclusion of an employment chapter
into the Maastricht II treaty. This was reported by news agency Reuters
citing a draft for a coalition motion for tomorrow's Bundestag debate on
Europe. Germany, however, will not hand over money or competence to the
European Union. The EU is only expected to co-ordinate the employment
policy more strongly. The Social-Democrats stated they would reject the
Maastricht II treaty if the participating states did not accept an umbrella
employment policy.
In relation to the Maastricht II treaty, Finance Minister Theo Waigel
warned again against relaxing the stability criteria for the planned
monetary union. It was important for Germany and all other participating
states to reach the deficit criterion of 3 percent of the gross national
product.

SPD decidedly against Grand Coalition
</H1>
SPD secretary-general Mr. Muentefehring and Lower Saxony's State Premier
Gerhard Schroeder have decidedly argued against a Grand Coalition with the
CDU. Mr. Muentefehring said: "It is not our task to pour perfume on the
dung that is being left behind." The SPD wanted a change of policy and for
that one needed a change in power.
Schroeder said whatever needs to be taken care of could be launched in both
houses of parliament even without a formal coalition agreement. In
Schroeder's view the Bonn coalition is at its end what regards content and
personnel, therefore, it was time that the Chancellor cleared the way for
general elections. Schroeder said: "We would solve the problem of who will
run for Chancellorship in a flash." The coalition, however, would try to
survive until the 1998 general elections to stay in power.

Christian Union wants to punish moonlighting more severely
</H1>
CDU/CSU want to make moonlighting in the construction industry a criminal
offence. Currently, moonlighting is categorized as a violation of the
labour code [A code violation is not considered a criminal offence]. This
is the gist of a 13-point plan by the Union to step up measures against
illegal employment at construction sites. The plan also calls for higher
fines.
Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt also advocated more flexible wages. At
the German Construction Industry Convention in Bonn Rexrodt said it was
time for a fundamental reform of regional collective agreements. The
president-elect of the Central Association of the German Construction
Industry Mr. Walter also called for wages more closely tied to performance
and for the reduction of moonlighting. In view of increasing unemployment
the SPD reproached the government of failure. SPD members of parliament
Ernst Schwanhold and Achim Grossmann criticized that in spite of that the
government wanted to continue making conditions for depreciation stricter.
Instead, investments were required.

Federation of Unions calls for reform of student assistance
</H1>
The National Federation of Unions DGB has called for a reform of government
student assistance (BaFoeG). The currently granted direct and indirect
assistance [partly as loan and stipend to students, and tax breaks and
child benefits to parents] should be turned into one base amount. This
education benefit should be paid directly to the student and topped up by
an education assistance dependent on the parents' income. The proposal was
endorsed by the Conference of University and College Presidents and the
Federal Office for Student Affairs. These organizations say the reform is
necessary to remove social injustice and holes in the system. The SPD
demanded today to extend the plan to all students [i.e. including those in
professional and trade schools] and wants to introduce a bill during the
summer.

Conflict research institutes demand end of obligatory military service
</H1>
Leading German conflict research institutes have demanded the abolition of
obligatory military service in Germany. In their annual peace report the
institutes state that the conversion of the German Bundeswehr to a
professional army was sufficient to guarantee the security interests. At

report the researchers also point out that there was world-wide progress in
arms control.

Call for Alliance for Children
</H1>
The National Association of Protestant Day Cares has called for an Alliance
for Children. At a congress of 4000 teachers the organization's president
Mr. Storihm (sp?) said the care facilities for children under three years
was catastrophic. Many day care centres were open for no more than six
hours daily. The [recently introduced] right on a day care place had
improved the situation but often at expense of quality. Therefore parents,
employers, teachers, and politicians had to get together.

Popular initiative for abolition of Bavarian Senate started
</H1>
Today the popular initiative for the abolition of the Bavarian Senate has
been launched in Bavaria. During the next two weeks citizens can sign lists
in town and city halls. When ten percent of eligible citizens, or about
880,000 people, sign the lists the Bavarian parliament must deal with the
future of the Senate. This could lead to a referendum.
The initiative has been launched by the Ecological Democratic Party and is
supported by SPD, Alliance90/Greens, and FDP. They think the Senate is not
democratically legitimized, is meaningless for the political process, and a
waste of tax money.
