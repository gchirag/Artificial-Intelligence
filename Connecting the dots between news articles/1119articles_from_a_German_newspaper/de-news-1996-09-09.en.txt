Lufthansa wage negotiations begin in Frankfurt
</H1>
Wage negotiations for the 44,000 employees of the former government-owned
Lufthansa airline began in Frankfurt today. The negotiations are focusing on
financial pressures. The unions want to keep as many jobs as possible while
Lufthansa plans to tie parts of its employees' wages to the successes and
failures of the company. Lufthansa CEO Juergen Weber demanded zero or even
"negative" wage increases for the next three years. The public service
employees union OETV had originally planned not to enter the usual negotiation
rituals of demands and counterdemands in order to be able to find compromises
without big public appeareances. In reaction to Weber's demand, however, they
now demand a 2.3 percent increase for all Lufthansa employees. The DAG union,
negotiating separately, is demanding four percent. According to OETV head
negotiator Manfred Merzke, both unions are angry at Weber because he apparently
only has stockholders' interests in mind.
