Heated discussion in the Bundestag
</H1>
During the first reading of the government's drafts on tax
laws and the economy package, heated discussion took place.
Finance minister Eichel defended the government's plans against
accusations of social injustice. He said the plans would take load
off persons with low income, families with children, and middle range
corporations. The opposition argued the government was all wrong
on tax policies. The government did not succeed, in their opinion,
in reviving the economy and taking pressure off the labor market.
At the same time, the CDU's financial expert Maerz offered his
party's help in drying up public budgets.

in connection with the scandal around the multimillion fiasco in the
LWG popular housing corporation, in which the state holda a 50%
share.SPD vice faction leader Maget accused Stoiber of having lied to
the chamber. Reportedly, Stoiber had much more of a hand in LWG's
business policies than he has been admitting. The opposition based
its foray on declarations made by fired minister of justice Sauter,
who had chaired LWG's supervisory board. During a special session
of thr Bavarian state parliament, Sauter alleged to have informed
Stoiber about the corporation's financial problems and asked for
nominating a crisis manager. The premier refuted these allegations
and said he could in no way be held responsible for the corporation's
financial troubles.
