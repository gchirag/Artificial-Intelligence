Schili steps up efforts for dual citizenship
</H1>
Federal Minister of the Interior Schili has stepped up
efforts to implement the dual citizenship plan.  Bundestag
representatives from the Bavarian SPD held a meeting at the
Irsee monastery (also in Bavaria).  According to Mr. Schili,
the members discussed the draft of the law to be proposed
next week.  The minister was satisfied that the number of
people who are critical of the signature campaign headed by
(CDU politicians) Stoiber and Schaeuble is growing, even
within the CDU. At the same time, Mr. Schili stressed that
he is still open to constructive negotiations with the FDP
and the CDU.  A new election of the full executive committee
will also take place at the meeting. There is little doubt
that the SPD state head will be reelected.

<P>
Meanwhile, there is growing opposition from within the CDU
to its proposed signature campaign in opposition to the
proposed dual citizenship law.  This issue will play center
stage when CDU delegates meet in Koenigswinter near Bonn.

CDU still committed to signature campaign
</H1>
Despite criticism from within its ranks, the CDU remains
committed to its signature campaign in opposition to the proposed dual
citizenship law.  The campaign was approved by a large majority at a
meeting of the CDU executive committee in Koenigswinter.  Only three
committee members voted against the initiative.  Party head Wolfgang
Schaeuble said that collecting signatures was warranted because dual
citizenship should be rejected.  He said it ran counter to the goal of
integrating foreigners. At the same time, the CDU would like to make
immigration easier for those foreigners who choose to remain in Germany
for their entire lives. A CDU counter-proposal will be released soon.

is a way, both for employers and employees. Mr. Jagoda appealed for
voluntary compromises. He said that a legal resolution should always be
the last resort.  He recommended that employers and works councils agree
on more flexible work hours. The Federal Institute of Labor released

European politicians want Euro paper currency in 2000
</H1>
After the Euro's successful start on financial markets, CDU and FDP have
called for Euro paper currency to be issued earlier. Werner Hojer of the
FDP stated that politicians have underestimated citizens' adaptability to
the new currency. Hojer suggested minting notes and coins as early as
2001. He added that it is technically possible to have Euro currency ready
by January 1, 2000. Karl Lamers of the CDU had similar thoughts.
However, the Federal Ministry of Finance argued that the three year period
between the introduction of the Euro and the issuing of currency is
necessary to mint the notes and coins.
