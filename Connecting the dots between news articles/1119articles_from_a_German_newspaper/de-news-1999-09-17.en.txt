Last day of the budget and cost-cutting debate in parliament
</H1>
On the eve of the Saxony state elections, coalition and opposition parties
battled it out once again in federal parliament (Bundestag) when debating
budget and cost-cutting measures. Finance Minister Eichel said that he
was prepared to look at proposals by the opposition parties - but they
obviously lacked a concept. Once again he emphasised that the cost-cutting
measures were not negotiable. CDU General Secretary Merkel condemned the
regional co-operation between SPD and PDS in the former East German states.
She also thought that Chancellor Schroeder did not care about majorities
but acted according to what a French sovereign had once said: "I'm the
state - l'etat c'est moi".

Electricity generators meet Greens: "constructive talks"
</H1>
The Greens party and electricity generators apparently have got a bit closer
to an agreement in the dispute about decommissioning nuclear power plants.
This was the first joint meeting between Federal Environment Minister
Trittin, Foreign Minister Fischer and CEOs of four of the biggest
electricity providers, and last night they said in Berlin that they would
meet again. The 2 1/2-hour meeting apparently had been very constructive.
It had been about the issue of how long power plants could still be used,
and the halt of nuclear waste transports.

Newspaper: six German nuclear power plants to be off the grid shortly
</H1>
According to the newspaper SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, six nuclear power plants
will have to shut down within the next few months, if they cannot get rid
of their nuclear waste. The paper quotes a confidential memo from Federal
Environment Minister Trittin to Chancellor Schroeder. In principle,
transport could still be arranged in time, but the companies did not meet
the required conditions. If there was no change, the first reactor, at Stade,
would be off the grid as early as February 2000. Mr Trittin said on
television ZDF that he could think of alternatives to nuclear waste
transports.

Greens: no to single-track line for magnetic levitation train
</H1>
Outgoing Federal Transport Minister Muentefering's announcement that the
magnetic levitation train Transrapid between Hamburg and Berlin would now
have one track only, for the time being, caused a bit of a stir. His
ministry said that the decision had been put to the vote within the
coalition, but the Greens' parliamentary group would have none of that.
Heads of the parliamentary group Mueller and Schlauch said that this was
a cheap trick to contain costs in the short run. The CDU/CSU, however, was
quite for it, as well as the companies involved, such as German Railways
(Bahn AG) and Thyssen Krupp.

Bavaria's Constitutional Court: scrapping Upper House was legal
</H1>
Getting rid of Bavaria's Upper House (Senat) by referendum was legal,
even without a quorum, according to a ruling by the Bavarian Supreme
Constitutional Court. Now the Upper House will cease to exist at the end
of the year, just what the voters had wanted in the 1998 referendum. The
court, however, asked for higher thresholds for similar referenda in the
future (requesting changes to the constitution). According to current
regulations, the quorum is set at 25%, meaning that at least 25% of
all eligible voters would have to be in favour of an amendment to the
constitution.

Federal Constitutional Court: energy markets can be liberalised
</H1>
13 towns and cities applying to the Federal Constitutional Court for an
urgent injunction against the liberalisation of the electricity market,
did not succeed. They wanted to keep their transmission monopolies beyond
10 August 2000. Cities such as Munich, Kiel and Saarbruecken had complained
that the Energy Law of 1998 had triggered a cut-throat price-competition,
something the local energy providers could not handle.
