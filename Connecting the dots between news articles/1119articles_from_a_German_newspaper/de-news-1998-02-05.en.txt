"Great Surveillance Scheme" - Bremen's votes will be decisive
</H1>
The coalition committee of Bremen's SPD/CDU state government
met in Bonn tonight to decide on the state's position in Friday's
Bundesrat vote on the "great surveillance scheme".  CDU insists
on agreeing to the compromise solution voted by the Bundestag.
Head of federal state government Schaerf (SPD), on the other
hand, wants to impose protection against the proposed surveillance
of all professionals with a legal right to refuse testimony. All
5 red/green state governments have already announced they would
vote against the necessary constitutional amendment. This makes
Bremen's votes decisive for obtaining the necessary two thirds majority.

Bundestag votes down SPD plan for construction industry
</H1>
The Bundestag with the votes of the government coalition voted down
tonight a plan for improving the situation in the construction industry
proposed by SPD. Representatives of FDP and the Union parties,
in the course of a debate preceding the vote, declared that what was
needed was basic structural changes rather than pure activism.
The tax reform bill blocked by SPD would have been a decisive
step towards improving conditions.
SPD speakers accuse the coalition of dodging responsibility in the
construction crisis.
The SPD plan had asked for, among other things, decisive curbing
of moonlighting, a procedural review of subsidies for housing
construction financed on the open market as well as an increase
in local government investments the building area.

Bundestag votes down legal ban on smoking
</H1>
Smoking will not, for the time being, be outlawed in Germany's
public buildings and in working areas. A clear majority of the
Bundestag in Bonn voted against a draft for protecting non-smokers.
336 Bundestag members voted against the inter-party draft. 256
members voted in favour and 34 abstained. Federal minister for
health Seehofer, CSU, again came out against the proposal
during the debate preceding the vote. For better protection of
smokers and non-smokers, information is better than an
outright ban, he said.
The SPD vice-leader, Ms. Matthaeus-Maier, defended the
proposal. She refuted warnings against supposedly enormous
economical burdens.
The draft would have penalised infringement of the anti-smoking
law with fines up to DM 5,000.

State government allegedly subsidised extreme rightist seminar

According to the NDR radio magazine "Panorama", the ministry of
the interior of Baden-Wuerttemberg subsidised a seminary in
which a number of notorious extreme rightists took part. In today's
edition of the magazine it was reported that - according to the
proceedings of the meeting - the question of Polish war guilt was
