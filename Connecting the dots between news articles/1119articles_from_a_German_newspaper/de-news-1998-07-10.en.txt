Upper House (Bundesrat) agrees to new rules for refugees
</H1>
The Upper House (Bundesrat) has given its consent to a whole raft of new
laws.

<P>
If someone applies for asylum and there is proof they have done so in order
to obtain benefits, they will have their benefits cut drastically.
This is targeted against new refugees getting into Germany in order to be
on the social welfare benefit. The new rule would also apply to applicants
who have been turned down but try to foil deportation orders by
destroying their identification papers. There are, however, exceptions,
for example for foreigners who are allowed to stay for the time being.

Mr Geissler warns against electioneering using policies against foreigners
</H1>
CDU politician Geissler warned the ruling CDU/CSU parties against using
policies against foreigners for election purposes. This would only
raise a lot of hackles without achieving a thing, and distract from the
real issues, according to an interview with the Berlin newspaper
BERLINER MORGENPOST. And this would also be true for all the others who
currently were pushing for stricter policies in this area. There should
rather be a global concept how to integrate foreign residents in Germany.
At the same time, poverty and civil war in many foreigners' home
countries should be fought (sic!), according to Mr Geissler.

claimed that running for the office a second time would be out of the
question.

<P>

sure there would not be an SPD president.

Polls on ability of Greens to join government
</H1>
More than two thirds of the population think the Greens are unable to
govern, according to market researcher FORSA. Only few people can handle the
Greens' extremist proposals, such as a general speed-limit for cars and
raising the price of petrol to 5 marks/litre. Most of the people
interviewed even thought that these concepts could jeopardise the
Greens' getting into parliament
