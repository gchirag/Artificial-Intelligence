employees HBV has threatened to broaden the token strikes if the employers

outlined the demands today in Duesseldorf, saying that the employers next
step had to be the creation of a solid basis for resolving the conflict.

again extended on this, a "long" Saturday [when shops are permitted to stay
open longer than usual. HBV counted more than 2,000 employees laying down

Brawls in Bremen
</H1>
After a quiet night, Bremen was witness to more altercations today, with police
temporarily arresting about 100 persons. A police spokesperson reported that
members of the autonomous groups lit up garbage cans and attacked police
officers. This situation is now under control, he added. During Friday night
and Saturday morning, the Bremen part of Ostertor was witness to heavy
fighting between several hundred punks and police forces. The punks chose
Bremen after being prevented to congregate in Hannover, which had prevented
a renewal of the so-called "Chaos days" by outlawing organized gatherings.

said Garett, adding that probably already tomorrow the EU will decide the
withdrawal from Mostar.

Stoiber advocates consumer tax hike
</H1>
The state premier of Bayern Edmund Stoiber (CSU) advocated an
increase in consumer taxes. On Deutschlandfunk radio, Stoiber reasoned that
taxation on consumption was too little, on income too much. He mentioned
that direst taxes like the income tax needed to be lowered and consumer taxes
like the value-added tax should be increased. A tax reform should help clear
up the tax confusions so that the citizens could do their tax reforms
themselves, he added.
Finance Minister Waigel as well thought that an increase of the value-added tax
as part of the tax reform was a feasible option, but warned against using this
as the only funding for the reform. At the same time, Waigel ruled out that
the reform would take place anytime before 1999.

Priebke judges in focus of retrial debate
</H1>
Filing conflict-of-interest charges against the head judge of the Rome
tribunal, both public prosecutors and joint plaintiffs want to obtain a new
trial against the former SS officer Priebke. In Rome today, public prosecutor
Scandura said this was the only way to open the trial again. If the Court
of Cassation approves the charges, the verdict would be suspended.
Judge Guistelli was quoted as saying before the trial that he expected Priebke
to be acquitted. However, two charges of conflict-of-interest already failed
during the proceedings.
The military tribunal had found Priebke guilty of taking part in the execution
of 335 Italian civilians in the Ardeatine caves, but ruled that the statute of
limitations had expired.

No coalition between PDS and SPD
</H1>
A coalition joining SPD and PDS on more than just the local level
is, according to the Berlin PDS chairwoman Pau, neither possible nor desirable.
Talking on South German radio, Pau reasoned that for such a coalition at
this point there were neither political foundations nor public acceptance.
In her opinion the PDS, burdened with a backpack full of memories, was
situated very well in the opposition role.
