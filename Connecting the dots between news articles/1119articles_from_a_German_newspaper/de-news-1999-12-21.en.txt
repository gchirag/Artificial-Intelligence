Government expects tax law to pass Bundesrat
</H1>
The German government strongly assumes that the tax law for the next
few years will pass the Bundesrat. [Federal laws that affect the
federal states must be approved by the upper house of parliament, the
Bundesrat, the representation of the states.] When Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder presented the reform package in Berlin, he pointed out that
Finance Minister Hans Eichel had already talked preliminarily with the
states. Schroeder and Eichel announced that tax payers will have to pay
more than 70 million DM less net tax. Schroeder said this was possible
by a successful policy of budget consolidation. The scheme provoked
contrasting responses from industry, unions, and CDU/CSU. The latter
accused the government, the measures were too late and did not go far
enough.

situation.

Merkel strongly criticizes Kohl
</H1>
CDU Secretary-General Angela Merkel has severely criticized former
party leader Helmut Kohl because of his stance in the donations
affaire. Kohl had caused his party a damage of millions of marks, Ms.
Merkel writes in the daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. He had also
reduced the credibility of the party. Merkel said it was unacceptable
that Kohl kept secret the names of the donators. It was inappropriate
to put a promise above law and order. The CDU had to dissociate from
its honorary president and take its future into its own hand.
The Prosecution in Bonn will decide after Christmas whether to start
investigations against Kohl.

Businesses and communities will contribute to compensation fund
</H1>
More and more businesses are declaring themselves willing to participate
in the compensation fund for former NS prisoners-of-war. Besides the
German Telekom, the Pharmatological company Schering also wants to
contribute.  A Schering representative announced that the company will
effect the payments, despite the fact that very few forced labourers are
said to have worked there during the second world war. The first
community to join the initiative was Buedelsdorf in Schleswig-Holstein.
A representative for the community declared that a symbolic contribution
of 25,000 DM will be paid. Forced labourers were put to work there for a
private company that doesn't exist any more.

Hostage situation in Aachen still tense
</H1>
In a hostage situation in Aachen, there is no sign as yet of a solution
after more than thirty hours. The suspect is very determined and shows
no willingness to yield, declared a police representative. Yesterday the
man gained power over three employees of a money transport firm, and has
since then been taking cover in the offices of the regional central bank
in Aachen. He is demanding an unknown sum in ransom money in addition to
safe conduct with the hostage. This was refused by officials, due to the
incalculable risks.
