Results of the state elections in Saxony
</H1>
In Saxony's state elections, the CDU maintained its absolute majority in
spite of slight losses. It received almost 57% of the votes. Early on it
seemed even possible to receive 2/3 of the state assembly seats, but at
the end the votes were not enough. The absolute loser of the election is
the SPD.

<P>
Saxony's social democrats received only about 10%. This result places
them behind the PDS with the voters for the first time since 1990.
The chair of the state SPD, Karl-Heinz Kunkel, immediately drew the
consequences from the desastrous result and resigned from office.
The PDS replaces the social democrats as the second strongest political
force in the state. The goal of "20% + x" was safely reached. The threeparty parliament thus remains in the free state, because both the Greens
and the FDP failed to achieve the 5% hurdle together with the rightextremist party NPD and the Republikaner.
Prior to the eletions Gunda Roestel, leader of Saxony's Greens, had not
ruled out personal consequences in case of an election fiasco.

SPD loses to CDU, PDS and non-voters
</H1>
After initial analyses, the SPD mainly lost votes to CDU and PDS.The
social democrats surrendered 22,000 votes to CDU and 41,000 votes to
PDS. In addition, 34,000 SPD supporters did not vote at all. But the
additional votes from SPD did not help the CDU very much, because
41,000 CDU supporters changed over to the PDS. The fact that the losses
by the CDU were only marginal is due to the good motivation of its own
voting members. An additional 31,000 CDU supporters were mobilized. The
CDU won above average with young voters and citizens age 44 and up. The
PDS is the party of unemployed people and citizens older than 45 years
in Saxony. In addition, the SED successor was able to gain the support
of 39,000 former non-voters. The Greens lost 12,000 votes each to the
CDU and the PDS. The FDP voters switched mainly to the CDU.

State elections in Brandenburg may be invalid
</H1>
The state elections in Brandenburg may have to be repeated, as reported
by ARD television magazin "Report". The reasons are irregularities in
the listing of the state list of the right-extremist party DVU in March.

<P>
The ARD tv magazin reports that DVU candidates were voted on in blocks
instead of having been elected separately and freely during a party congress. If this is correct, which was apparently established by the state
domestic intelligence agency, it must first be decided whether any
existing laws were violated. The chairperson of the Bundestag's legal
committee, Scholz, considers block election to be highly questionable
under constituional law. If a complaint were to be filed, whih could be
done by any citizen, one would have to determine whether the elections
in Brandenburg would, indeed, have to be repeated.
