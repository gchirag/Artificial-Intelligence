The poor results of "Buendnis90/Greens" in the local elections of
Schleswig-Holstein caused a controversy within the party. The
spokesperson of the Bundestag faction of the "Union 90/Greens", Fischer,
demanded an open discussion on the consequences. At the same time, he
referred to the demand for a higher tax on airplane fuel as a mistake
and a private opinion. His colleague, Mueller, stressed that the
agreements of Magdeburg about an ecological tax may have been important.
The Chairperson of the Board, Ruestel, held the negative image of the
party responsible for low election results. The secretary-general of the
party, Ruehle, warned not to concentrate too much on ecological topics
during the Bundestag elections. SPD leader Lafontaine urged the Greens
to reconsider their politics while referring to the attempted increase
of gasoline prices. Secretary-general of the CDU, Hintze, explained that
the Greens had been punished during the elections because of their
demands. Both politicians were satisfied about the showing of their
