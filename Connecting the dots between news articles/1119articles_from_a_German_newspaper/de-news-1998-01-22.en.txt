No work group for the financial adjustment reform
</H1>
In a fight for a reform of the financial adjustment of the states the
positions are hardening. At a conference of the Finance Ministers of the
16 states in Bonn, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg did not succeed with
their request to mobilize a working team. The conflict about equalization
payments will now possibly be taken to the Federal Constitutional Court.
Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg threatened again with a suit in Karlsruhe
in case no progress would be made with the discussions by summer break.
Hesse also considers a financial adjustment reform necessary. State
Premier Eichel told the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station that the
stabilisation of the public budgets has to be accomplished before a reform
can take place.

Schoenbohm introduced a new security concept for the German capital. The
two CDU politicians explained that within the scope of the statewide
initiative called "Aktion Sicherheitsnetz" (Campaign "Security Network") a
closer collaboration of security workers, a wider presence of police force
and a persistent interference against minor crime are the important
points. The campaign is also aimed at aggressive pan-handling, the
so-called "hobo scene", and graffiti sprayers. Kanther stressed that
nothing should be tolerated which could lead to crime.
