Interior ministers undecided on accepting more Kosovo refugees
</H1>
Bavaria announced its opposition to the plan by Federal Interior Minister
Schily to double the German quota of Kosovo refugees. Schily intends to
come to an agreement with the federal states to accept an additional
10,000 refugees. "It would be wrong to reward the inactivity of other
European countries by raising the German quota," Bavaria's Interior
Minister Beckstein argued. But Schleswig-Holstein's Interior Minister
Wienhold called the acceptance of additional refugees a very positive
decision. This would give authorities greater flexibility, especially
with respect to reuniting families. Only a few days ago, the interior
ministers decided to accept only so-called serious cases beyond the
10,000 refugees who had already arrived in Germany. The subject will be
discussed again tomorrow afternoon.

Hombach defends revision of 630-DM jobs
</H1>
Secretary of the Chancellor's Office Hombach defended the revision of
the 630-DM jobs, but he did not rule out changes. Hombach told the
Cologne newspaper Express that the goal was to stop the abuse in this
area that had been inherited from the Kohl government. However, steps
should be taken to ensure that the necessary flexibility for companies
and employees with respect to part-time work would be kept. A revision
of nominally independent contract work ("Scheinselbstaendigkeit") was
also overdue, Hombach added, since this area had also seen frequent
abuse.

Government considers lowering top tax rate
</H1>
The federal government considers lowering the top income tax rate to
43%. The chairperson of the Finance Committee of the Bundestag (lower
house of parliament), Scheel, gave this statement to the newspaper
Stuttgarter Nachrichten. Initially, the politician from the Green
Party stated that a tax rate of 48.5% by the year 2002 had been planned.
But now, it would be necessary to consider the ruling by the Federal
Finance Court which required a uniform taxation of commercial and
private income. Presently, the top tax rate is 53% for private income
and 47% for commercial income.

Ralf Ramnik may take over as new coach for Stuttgart VfB earlier than
had been anticipated. He'll be sitting on yhe coach's bench at tomorrow's Southern Derby game against FC Bayern-Muenchen, though officially he was to take over as of July 1st. Reason for his earlier
take-over: Having lost 8 games, just 4 points stand between VfB and
declassification. Stuttgart had their latest defeat against Wolfsburg
(2:3) last Saturday. Formerly of SSV Ulm 46, Ramnik is by now the 4th
coach VfB is having this season.
