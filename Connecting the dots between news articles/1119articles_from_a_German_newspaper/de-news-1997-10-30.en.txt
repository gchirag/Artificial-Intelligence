Pension contributions to rise
</H1>
Pension contributions will rise to 21% from next January. Currently they
stand at 20.3% of gross income. The Federal Government had previously given
the impression that the contribution rate would not have to be raised by
much, but only increased to 20.6% or 20.8%, at the most. The rate has to be
increased to the new record level because this year pension funds will
receive DM3.2 billion less in revenue from compulsory contributions. The
looming higher than expected increase was fiercely criticised by trade
associations. President of the employers' association, Hundt, spoke of an
attack on jobs and investment in Germany.

Keskin criticises Kohl's stance on dual citizenship
</H1>
The chairman of the Turkish community in Germany, Keskin, has criticised
the rejectionist position adopted by Chancellor Kohl on the issue of dual
citizenship for children born to foreign citizens in Germany. He told the
Berlin BZ daily that with his pronouncements Kohl was encouraging existing
prejudices against Turks resident in Germany. At the same time he pointed
out that dual citizenship laws were already in force in all neighbouring
European countries except Austria and Luxemburg. Keskin stressed that
experience with dual citizenship laws had been positive everywhere.

First Bundestag debate on new Federal Higher Education Law
</H1>
The bill of the new Federal Higher Education Law was today debated for the
first time in the Bundestag. The Social Democrats (SPD) want the new law to
explicitly rule out university tuition fees. The Christian Democratic
parties (CDU/CSU) oppose this, arguing that education falls under the
jurisdiction of the states. That issue apart, all parties obviously seem
content with the bill.
Amongst other issues, the new Federal Higher Education Law will introduce
new internationally recognised degrees like Masters and Bachelor degrees.
Intermediate exams will become compulsory for all subjects. Professors will
in future also be marked and assessed by students. But universities, too,
will have to face competition. Students will be able to decide on the basis
of rankings which university is the best. Universities, in turn, are
permitted to select a quota of 20% of their student intake themselves. The
draft bill of the new law will now be debated in the parliamentary
committees of the Bundestag. It remains contentious if the Upper House, or
Bundesrat, will also have to approve the new law.

Statute of limitations for GDR government criminality extended
</H1>
The Coalition parties in Bonn want to extend the statute of limitations
until the year 2000 for certain injustices committed in the former German
Democratic Republic (GDR). This was declared jointly by the General
Secretaries of both CDU/CSU and FDP after Coalition talks held at the
Chancellor's Office. According to current law the statute of limitations
regarding the pursuit of medium level cases of GDR government criminal
activity expires at the end of the year. Amongst them are deprivation of
liberty, grievous bodily harm and the perversion of justice. With this
third extension the deadline is brought into line with the overall statute
of limitations for all injustices committed during the existence of the GDR.
