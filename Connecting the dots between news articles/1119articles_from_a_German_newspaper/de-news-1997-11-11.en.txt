Tax revenue forecast: 40bn slump over the next two years
</H1>
The federal state, the individual German states, and communities
will have to make do with almost DM40bn less in tax revenues for this
and the next year than planned in the budget. This is the bottom line
of the new tax revenue forecast published today by the Federal Finance
Ministry in Bonn. According to calculations of the committee for tax
revenue forecasts, the total splits into DM17.3bn less this year, and
DM22.4bn next year. The federal budget will be affected by approximately
one sixth of these amounts.

<P>
Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel reassured that Germany will
nonetheless satisfy the budget deficit criteria for the Euro [that is
for taking part in the European Monetary Union (EMU)]. Already in the
morning the coalition had agreed on measures to compensate for the lost
revenues. In particular these measures include another postponement in
the repayment of the "Erblastentilgungsfond" (Debt Redemption Fund).
This fond services the debts of former East-Germany. Mr Waigel called on
the [German] states and communities to continue their efforts to
consolidate the budget. According to internal coalition reports,
Mr Waigel also intends to sell many more Deutsche Telekom shares than
planned earlier.

<P>
The SPD calls the numbers of the new forecast catastropic. SPD
parliamentary party leader Rudolf Scharping demanded to take firmer
action against tax dumping and tax fraud. The Confederation of German
Unions (DGB) demanded a tax revenue action programme.

Women quota in line with European law
</H1>
The preference given to women when applying for jobs
or promotions in the public sector does not as such violate European
law. The European Court decided today that North Rhine-Westphalia's
Women Promotion bill is in line with European law. Quotas were allowed
as long as men with equal qualifications would not be discriminated
automatically. The ruling decided a case filed by a teacher who
considered his promotion treated unfairly due the North Rhine-Westphalia's
women quota.

<P>
Politicians, unions and women activists' groups unanimously welcomed
the decision. North Rhine-Westphalia's Minister for Women's Equalisation
Rydda Melchers (sp?) called today a historic day for women in Europe.

<P>
Federal Minister for Women Claudia Nolte said the ruling provides for
more clarity in this matter. SPD and the Greens said they felt being
confirmed in their women's policy. The union for public service and
transportation (OeTV) said the decision reaffirmed there legal
conception of women quota.

Coalition to start new talks with SPD
</H1>
The coalition parties CDU, CSU and FDP want to start new
negotiations with the SPD on changes in the pension system and in the
tax system. Federal Finance Minister Theo Waigel said all the [coalition]
parties support this new offer of talks. Given the new slump in tax
revenues, he asked the SPD to no longer block a structural reform of
the tax system. When it comes to the pension system, it was absolutely
necessary to prevent an increase of pension contributions to 21% from
next year on.

Glos: increase to 21% cannot be stopped
</H1>
Leader of CSU members of parliament Michael Glos believes that
the increase of pension contributions to 21% [of payed out wages and
salaries] from next year on can no longer be stopped. Mr Glos said it
was dangerous not to increase the value added tax (VAT) [also known as
goods and services tax - GST - or sales tax] at the beginning of next
year. It was, however, impossible to put this increase into effect by
January. Therefore CDU's and FDP's demand to advance the reform of the
pension system and the VAT increase by one year to January 1998 was
unrealistic.

SPD: Minimum tax for "write-off artists"?
</H1>
SPD financial expert Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier has reproached the
governing coalition for not fighting firmly enough against unemployment.
In a radio interview she said the core of the problem was not taxes
but the level of social security contributions. This leads to too
high a burden on work costs. Ms Matthaeus-Maier believes that profits,
not losses should be rewarded. Therefore the SPD wants a minimum tax
for "write-off artists" who declare a negative total income.

Mr Kanther said after the meeting that based on this decision they
will start new negotiations with the [coalition partner] FDP. The FDP
favours the possibility of double citizenship for these children.

No access for privacy commissioner to workers' representation computer
</H1>
According to a leading decision of the Federal Labour Court,
the privacy commissioner of a company is not allowed to monitor the
computers of the workers' representation. Such a supervision would
contradict the independency of the workers' representation
required by the industrial relations scheme. To this respect,
the privacy commissioner has to be seen of belonging to the employer's
side.

Constitutional Court starts hearing of sports reporting case
</H1>
Today the Federal Constitutional Court started the hearing
of a case filed by the Federal government against a passage in the
current radio and television acts of the different states, allowing
for brief sports reporting on television free of charge. Under
the radio and television acts, every station is allowed to report
about any sports event for at most 90 seconds, even if
the station has not bought any broadcasting rights. According to the
government, this bill violates [constitutional] rights protecting
ownership. The final ruling of the Constitutional Court is not
expected until in a few months time.

Baden-Wuerttemberg to make more debts
</H1>
The CDU/FDP coalition in Stuttgart won't be able to continue
its current policy of austerity. Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Erwin
Teufel said the expected hugh decrease in tax revenues could not be
balanced through savings in the budget anymore. Therefore further loans
have to be taken out. Mr Teufel expressed his concern that the state's
1998 tax revenue could be as much as DM1.2 billion below earlier forecasts.
As a further measure to counter this slump in revenues a general spending
stop has been imposed.
