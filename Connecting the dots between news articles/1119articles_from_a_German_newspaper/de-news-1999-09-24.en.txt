Catholic church: we agree to disagree on pregnancy counselling
</H1>
The catholic bishops took differing stands in the dispute about family
planning/pregnancy counselling. The bishops of Hamburg, Limburg, Magdeburg
and Osnabrueck declared they wanted to talk with the Pope about keeping
the existing official system (where you need to see one of their counselling
agencies before applying for an abortion). The bishops of Eichstaett and
Bamberg, however, want to stop these services, after a transitional period.
Cologne's archbishop Meissner seems to back the latter. Previously the
head of the Conference of German Bishops Lehmann had said, that in the long
run the catholic church wanted to get out of the counselling system. The
Central Committee of German Catholics meanwhile set up a new agency to
keep counselling pregnant women

Upper House (Bundesrat) debate
</H1>
Leading opposition politicians asked for changes to the cost-cutting measures
in the Upper House (Bundesrat), but at the same time showed that they were
ready to compromise. Bavarian State Premier Stoiber said that in view of the
federal responsibility there would be no policy of blocking matters.
The Upper House (Bundesrat) published a statement, that was also backed by
the SPD-led states, asking (federal) government not to get rid of commitments
and shift the burden to the states. Finance Minister Eichel said that he
would agree to changes, provided the total of 30 billion marks stayed.
Opposition members of parliament also said they would be prepared to talk as
far as the health reforms were concerned; at the same time they warned of
a class-system in the health sector. The states also wanted the system
checked out, where some had to make transfer payments to other states' public
health insurers.

Mr Scharping: situation of the coalition "very serious"
</H1>
Deputy head of the SPD-party Scharping said that the situation of the
Red-Green coalition was "very serious". In an interview with the newspaper
SUEDDEUTSCHE ZEITUNG, the Defence Minister criticised  blunders during the
introduction of the law reforming the 630-marks jobs (often called McJobs),
as well as the general lack of discipline. If the coalition concentrated on
the essentials, the coalition would survive until the next elections. In an
interview with the newspaper BRAUNSCHWEIGER ZEITUNG, spokesperson Roestel,
of the Greens-party, said that the coalition's problems could be fixed.
Colleagues' thoughts about leaving the coalition would be "frivolous",
according to Ms Roestel. Spokesperson of the executive Radcke also declared
that the coalition was not in a crisis.

Metalworkers' Union: hardly a chance for Treaty for Work
</H1>
In the newspaper KOELNER STADTANZEIGER, deputy head of the Metalworkers'
Union Peters (IG-Metall) wrote that the Treaty for Work did not have a
chance, accusing federal government of favouring the employers' attitude of
blocking things. The Red-Green coalition did not do enough to really get
more employment through the Treaty for Work. He also accused Labour Minister
Riester of having caved in to demands by the employers, as far as the issue
of drawing pensions at 60 years of age (instead of 65) was concerned.

Cologne says farewell to Mr Willy Millowitsch
</H1>
Today several thousand mourners in Cologne said good-bye to popular actor
Willy Millowitsch, who had passed away last Monday. Many of his fans put
flowers on his coffin at the Family Theatre. Tomorrow the city will organise
an official ceremony for their honorary citizen at town-hall, and there will
be a mass at Cologne's cathedral at midday, with the coffin present, too.
The latter normally is a privilege accorded to a bishop and his staff.
They bent the rules for Mr Millowitsch, though, just like when Mr Adenauer
died (former Federal Chancellor of Germany). The burial will be in the
afternoon.
