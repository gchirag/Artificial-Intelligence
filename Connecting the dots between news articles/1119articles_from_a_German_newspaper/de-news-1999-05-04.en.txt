Cabinet decides to deploy 600 more soldiers
</H1>
The Cabinet has decided to send 600 more soldiers of the Bundeswehr on a
humanitarian Mission to Albania and Macedonia. A government spokesperson
said parliament would decide on the mandate on Friday. The German soldiers
will be deployed as paramedics, for the transport of the sick, to run camps
and for telecommunication. 3'300 Bundeswehr soldiers are already deployed
in Macedonia. The SPD and B90/G parliamentary factions approved the
deployment. CDU/CSU and FDP, too, basically agreed with the government.
Germany, however, will not accept any more Kosovar refugees. In a
tele-conference among government and federal states the states headed by a
conservative government rejected a corresponding suggestion by Federal
Interior Minister Otto Schily. First, the other EU countries had to fulfill
their obligations.

Start of final budget deliberations for 1999
</H1>
Finance Minister Hans Eichel has announced strict savings for the 1999
budget. In the debate of the 1999 budget Mr Eichel said that the march into
a debt ridden state must be stopped. The government is already paying DM225
million in daily interest. This is choking the budget and drastically
reduces the room for political decisions. Therefore, all government
spending, aids and benefits must be checked, said Mr Eichel. SPD and
Buendnis90/Gruene announced deep budget cuts for next year. The SPD
faction's financial spokesman Joachim Poss rejected demands by the industry
for further tax reductions. First, the budget deficit had to be coped with.
The government had inherited the budget problems from the old government.
In addition, the Federal Constitutional Court had demanded to improve the
financial situation of families with children. Mr Eichel said he would
present a comprehensive finance-political package in the summer.
Spokespersons of CDU/CSU and FDP called for true tax breaks for individuals
and industry. They accused the red-green coalition of economic
disorientation. The budget was based on creative accounting and an
impediment to growth and employment. In addition, obvious room for savings
had not been used. The budget draft for 1999 includes 486 billion DM
spending and 53.5 billion DM new loans.

Settlement proposal for disputed payments to FDP failed
</H1>
In the dispute about a payment to the FDP of DM 12.4 million out
of public funds for party financing, a settlement proposal by the Higher
Regional Court has been rejected by the plaintiffs. According to the
proposal of the court, the FDP had to acknowledge mistakes when applying for
the funds and had to pay some DM 300,000 to the plaintiffs, itself keeping
some DM 12 million of the disputed payment. The two plaintiffs, "Die
Grauen" ["The Greys", or "The Grey-Haired", a pensioners' party] and "The
Voters' Initiative of Southern Schleswig" [a party of the Danish minority in
the State of Schleswig-Holstein], both rejected the proposal. In their opinion,
the FDP had applied too late for these funds and thus had no right to get them.
