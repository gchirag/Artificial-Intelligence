Red-red government in Schwerin establishing
</H1>
SPD state boss Ringstorff was elected State Premier
with SPD and PDS votes today. There were a few mavericks in the
red-red coalition: Ringstorff obtained but 39 of 70 valid votes;
SPD and PDS together have 47 votes in the state parliament.
CDU and CSU were sharply critical. CDU secretary general Hintze
said that the SPD had placed in the government the very persons
that the population had chased out of office in 1989. CSU
secretary general Protzner called the election an act of shame
for having been worked with the votes of the party that replaced
the former SED.

Mueller: new power plants needed if nuclear plants are closed
</H1>

energy sources such as sun and wind were growing in importance
but unable to replace the amount of power now generated by nuclear
plants. Mueller showed optimism on reaching an agreement on the
shutdown with nuclear power companies within a year. SPD and the
