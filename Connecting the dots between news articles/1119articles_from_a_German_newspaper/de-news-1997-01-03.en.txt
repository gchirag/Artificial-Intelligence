Cold and snow cause more mayhem in Europe
</H1>
Snow, ice and cold temperatures have caused more mayhem on
Europe's roads. In North and East Germany ferries had to battle with high
seas and the elements. Approximately two thirds of all German domestic
barges are tied up, as canals are completely frozen. In Germany, all trains
were running late, and some flights had to be cancelled. Sleet and snow are
predicted for Southwest Germany this weekend.

Real-estate tycoon Schneider taken to court
</H1>
Close to three years after the collapse of real-estate tycoon
Mr Schneider's company, the public prosecutor now took him to court. He is
mainly accused of fraudulent bankruptcy and obtaining loans through fraud.
Mr Schneider allegedly forged documents to obtain loans, and also laundered
250 million marks through Swiss bank accounts.

<P>
Mr Schneider's lawyers pointed out that the banks had not only been very
accommodating, but almost taken an active part in Mr Schneider's
business.

<P>
In 1994, Mr Schneider had caused Germany's biggest real-estate bankruptcy so
far, involving moneys to the tune of 5 billion marks. Mr Schneider and his
wife had subsequently left for Florida, where they were arrested in 1995 and
extradited to Germany. Mrs Schneider meanwhile was released from prison.

Germans eat 10% less beef
</H1>
Last year Germans ate 10% less beef, viz. 1.2 million (metric) tons of
beef and veal, according to official statistics. The lower demand, attributed
to perceived potential health-risks due to BSE, had led to considerable
over-supply and dramatic price-cuts.

SPD-spokes-person for external affairs on extending NATO
</H1>
Mr Vogt, SPD spokes-person for external affairs, emphasised the
requirement for NATO to be expanded to comprise former Communist countries
in Eastern Europe. He said that this would be necessary to stabilise both
Russia's western and NATO's eastern borders. He emphasised that this would
also facilitate the returning of a region, that had been a bone of contention
between between Russia and Germany and Russia for centuries, to the fold of
an international security organisation.

Mr Schaeuble: employers and unions to blame for part of unemployment
</H1>
Mr Schaeuble, head of the joint CDU/CSU parliamentary group, said
that employers and unions would have to take part of the blame for continued
high unemployment in Germany. He criticised both for not having made
good use of the leeway government had provided, to foster employment and
growth.
At the same
time, Mr Schaeuble put a damper on expectations that solidarity-surtax would
be phased out until the year 2000. Only snake-oil vendors would promise such
a thing. Secretary General Westerwelle, of the FDP, however, confirmed his
party's goal to get rid of the surtax until the year 2000.

Beginning of trial of ALDI extortionists
</H1>
The alleged perpetrators, accused of four attacks on ALDI supermarkets
using explosives last spring, admitted that they had done it, right at the
beginning of the trial. The two brothers from Halle told the Regional Court
they had wanted to hold the supermarket chain to ransom, to the tune of 3
million marks, and use the money to set up a restaurant. The 23- and 27-year
old men hid explosives in juice-packs and left them at ALDI-branches in
several cities.

Squatters' lobby-group: communes should look after them
</H1>
The association "Lobby for persons without fixed abode and the
poor" appealed to the communes to make sure people would not freeze during
the current cold snap. Public buildings and train stations should stay open
all night. Mr Moirer, the association's president, criticised on radio
Deutschlandfunk, that hardly any German town or city kept heated underground
(subway) stations open at night, to accommodate squatters. And even during
the day, the authorities, for example in Frankfurt, would try and evict
squatters. Any public servant causing a squatter to freeze to death would
be guilty of manslaughter. Mr Moirer asked for a telephone hotline to be
set up, for the use of squatters in distress or emergency situations.

Mr Muentefehring: more help needed for squatters
</H1>
Mr Muentefehring, federal manager of the SPD, asked politicians for
renewed efforts to fight the plight of people without fixed abode. The
recent cold snap had caused the death of 20 persons, who would have survived
had they lived in flats. It would be quite wrong to blame their death on the
cold weather: they had died from poverty and isolation. Reducing unemployment
would be the main factor in fighting the problem of squatters.

Mr Doering: no to autobahn levy
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg's economics minister Doering spoke out against
the introduction of a levy for the use of German autobahns, as a toll-charge
would only mean fleecing motorists once again. He added, that whoever tried
to ape the Austrians (who had recently introduced a levy for the use
of their autobahns) would do so mainly for populist reasons.
