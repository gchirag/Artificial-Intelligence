German Council of Trade Unions (DGB) passes resolution
</H1>
The Council of German Trade Unions (DGB) put paid to a controversy about
their view of market economics, and agreed to a compromise,
according to the delegates to the Dresden federal conference. Social
free economics (Soziale Marktwirtschaft) meant a historical achievement,
as compared to unbridled capitalism. The former, however, had been unable to
prevent mass unemployment and waste of resources. Tomorrow the delegates
will pass finer details of the resolution.

Semi-public health insurers allowed to raise premiums
</H1>
Most semi-public health insurers (Ersatzkassen) are allowed to raise their
premiums as of 1 December, a bit, according to the federal insurance
watchdog agency (Bundesversicherungsamt). The DAK, however, will be allowed
to raise premiums for its 1.1 million East German members only. As of 1
January, semi-public health insurers (Ersatzkassen) will have to lower their
premiums by .4%, for all their members. Higher premiums are required to
compensate for higher legislated transfer-payments to other health insurers,
according to the health insurers.

Mr Graf released on bail
</H1>
Mr Graf, father of tennis-player Steffi Graf, and his former financial
adviser Mr Joachim Eckhardt (sp?) were released from prison, on a
preliminary basis, after having been remanded in prison for 15 months.
5 million marks' bail was paid for Mr Graf. He and Mr Eckhardt are to report
to the police once a week, and they are not to leave Germany. The judge said
that the sentence to be expected did not warrant remanding them in jail any
longer now. Both gentlemen are accused of having defrauded the tax office of
20 million marks (out of Miss Graf's income).
