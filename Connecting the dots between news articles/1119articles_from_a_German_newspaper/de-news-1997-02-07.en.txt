CSU pension commission against higher taxes on pensions
</H1>
Bavaria's state premier Stoiber allegedly has his party's support
as far as the CSU-internal squabbles about higher taxes on pensions were
concerned, according to the tabloid BILD. According to the same source he
disagreed with party president and Finance Minister Waigel: the latter
favoured higher taxes on pensions, whereas Mr Stoiber and his party's
commission on pensions were against. The commission thought that higher
taxes on pensions would stifle the economy, and may be against
constitutional rights (guaranteeing a person's property). If contributions
to the statutory pension scheme rose to 22% or 23% while pay-outs were
lowered at the same time, pensioners would receive zero return, and also
lose part of the capital they had paid in over the years. Following a
meeting of the CSU-party's executive, Mr Stoiber had declared once again
that Mr Waigel should count him out as far as the former's plans for higher
taxation of pensions were concerned.

Lafontaine thinks agreement with coalition parties can be quick
</H1>
Head of the SPD Lafontaine thinks a quick agreement on tax-reform
with Bonn's governing parties is possible. He said in an interview: "If
there's a will, anything can be fixed within a week". The SPD was ready for
a compromise. If government, however, wanted lower tax-rates for high-income
earners, they should come up with concrete proposal on how to pay for that.
Raising sales tax for that purpose would be out of the question, according
to Mr Lafontaine. So far he had been against lowering tax-rates for
high-income earners at all, but had not met with widespread approval even
within his own party. He also wants the coalition parties to scrap proposals
that would see pensioners and shift-workers worse off

Italy's state premier visits Germany
</H1>
This morning Italian premier Prodi and twelve of his ministers arrived in
Bonn for the 12th German-Italian consultations. On the agenda were mainly
European issues, especially the questions concerning membership in the
European Common Currency system in 1999. Italy wants to be a founding member.
Who will be eligible to join is to be decided in spring 1998, based on member
countries' 1998 economic data.

<P>
Officially there are no plans to exclude Italy, in spite of rumours to the
contrary. But what's the point of Italy's joining when they might barely
scrape through now, yet never ever meet criteria afterwards. The Euro common
currency would be a weakling right from the start, and consequently
hurt national economies. Italian newspapers had reported that Mr Kohl
allegedly had proposed Italy become a member of the common currency system
as late as in 2002. Finance Minister Waigel refuted that - this had neither
been planned nor proposed. Chancellor Kohl's statement stands, however,
namely that Italy would have to do their homework, just like any other
country, to be able to join the European Common Currency system.

Chancellor Kohl optimistic in spite of high unemployment
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl is optimistic in spite of an all-time high in
unemployment. He expects a reversal of the trend within the year. In
Ludwigshafen he stated that the economy was picking up again, and government
still was planning to halve unemployment until the year 2000. Deputy
president of the SPD-party, Lower Saxony's state premier Schroeder,
criticised government and employers. They had watched Germany's prowess as
manufacturing country being rubbished, verbally, and done nothing about it.
And addressing Mr Kohl he stated: "You don't solve problems any more, you
are part of the problem."

Agreement on nuclear waste disposal in sight
</H1>
Government and SPD-governed states obviously struck a compromise as
far as the disposal of nuclear waste was concerned. Government spokes-person
Hausmann confirmed that a working group had come up with a paper, and that
would have to be voted on by the politicians. The weekly magazine FOCUS
previously had reported that government and opposition party SPD had reached
an agreement where, apart from the existing intermediate storage facility
at Gorleben in Lower Saxony, another one would be set up in Bavaria. Bavarian
state premier Stoiber refuted these reports, claiming: "Speculations about an
alleged agreement to the detriment of Bavaria, or disregarding Bavaria's
interests, are absurd."

</H1>
The death of a 14-year old female student from the Nuremberg area after
attending she had been to ski-camp in Austria, still is a mystery. According
to health officials there are more and more indications that she had not
been infected with legionellas (sp?) at the camp; more than likely she had
already carried the bug when she had left for the ski-camp in Saalbach. The
illness would have got worse there and caused pneumonia, eventually leading
to her death. Another female student, who had been in a critical situation
as well, was on the way to recovery now.
