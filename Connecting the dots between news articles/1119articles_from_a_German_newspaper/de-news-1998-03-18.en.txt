Big sporting events not going to pay-tv
</H1>
Big sporting events will continue to be broadcast without being
scrambled
or subject to pay-per-view charges. The state premiers have reached an
agreement on an "exclusion list" of events whose broadcast may not be
restricted to pay-tv. This list will be incorporated in the new
Inter-State Broadcasting Treaty. Baden-Wuerttemberg's Premier Teufel
explained that the Olympic Games were on the list, as well as all the
matches of the German National Soccer Team in European and World Soccer
Championships, and the opening matches, semi-finals, and finals of those
championships. The discussion about free access for television viewers
to
big sporting events came about after the sale of the broadcast rights
for
the World Soccer Championships in 2002 and 2006. The Kirch Group paid
FIFA
DM 3.4 billion for those rights.

Federal government criticizes agrarian policy of EU
</H1>
The federal government is not impressed with the EU Commission's
suggestions for future agrarian and farming-structure policies.
Government
spokesman Hausmann issued a statement to the effect in Bonn. The
suggestions, published under the title "Agenda 2000", put Germany at a
disadvantage in developing its rural areas, Hausmann said. He added that
future European policies must also leave enough room for independent
regional policies. The president of the German Farmer's Association,
Sonleitner, spoke of blatant provocation and announced massive
opposition.
The EU Commission wants to lower guaranteed prices for agricultural
products and issue direct assistance to farmers instead. The EU also
wants
to remove numerous regions from its structural development program. The
proposed changes could mean fewer supplements from Brussels for western
Germany.

Greens have concerns about Rau's candidacy for federal presidency
</H1>
The parliamentary group Alliance 90/the Greens has reservations
concerning
the possible candidacy of retiring North Rhine-Westphalia Premier Rau
for
the office of Federal President. Secretary-General for the group,
Ruehle,
told the "Braunschweiger Zeitung" newspaper that it would be most
regrettable if the SPD were to suggest that a deal had been made with
Rau
regarding candidacy in May 1999. The debate over the eventual
replacement
for current Federal President Herzog could only be conducted following
the
federal elections this September, Ruehle said. She added that at that
point, the discussion would also have to include the question of whether
it was not yet time for an eastern German candidate, or a woman.
