Mr. Waigel wants to make smaller payments to Europe
</H1>
 At an informal meeting of EU ministers of
finance, Minister of Finance Waigel reiterated his demand for
lowering the high net contribution to be made by Germany to the EU
budget.  At the Luxembourg spa Mondor, he said that the Federal
Republic was carrying 60 to 70 per cent of the total net cost of
the EU and said that this was not good.  Beginning in the year
2000, Mr.  Waigel wants to reduce the net payments to the EU from
the present payment of approximately 22 billion marks by 7 billion
marks.  The majority of EU ministers reacted to Mr. Waigel's demand
in a reserved manner.  To be sure, the EU commission was asked to
present a paper on the topic of contributions with its own figures
by October.  Waigel received support for his proposal from the
Netherlands which also called for a reduction of their
contribution.
According to some of the delegates, the president of the EU
that if all of them wanted to reduce their contribution, the
expansion of the EU would be endangered.

Euro-postponement would "not be a catastrophe" for BDI
</H1>
 The postponement of the Euro would "not be a catastrophe" for the
Federal Alliance of German Industry,  BDI-Chief Henkel
stated during an interview with the Italian newspaper IL TEMPO that
it was still possible, even though unlikely, that Germany and
France would fail to fulfill the stability criteria.  In that case,
a controlled postponement would be better than totally giving up on
the Euro-project.  The President of the BDI pointed out that the
great majority of Germans were still rejecting the Euro.

Mr. Henkel accuses Mr. Bluem of deceiving voters
</H1>
 In the matter of financing the system of social benefits,
BDI President Henkel accused Federal Labor Minister Bluem of
deceiving the voters.  Mr. Bluem's proposal that pension structure
reform be separated from refinancing was just too much, the BDI
chief said.  Mr. Bluem's social benefits policies had not been up
to date for a long time, he continued.  There was need for a
minister who would find jobs and not just hand out social benefits.

Ms. Griefhan: The Konrad shaft will never be used
</H1>
The projected permanent atomic waste facility "Konrad shaft" in
Salzgitter will never be activated.  This is the opinion of Monika
Griefhan, Lower Saxony's minister for the environment.  Her point
of departure, the SPD politician told the German press agency (dpa)
that, even after permission was granted, the facility would not be
constructed.  Since there was a sufficient number of intermediate
facilities, she continued, there would be no need for energy
suppliers to construct a permanent facility.  Ms. Griefhan
reiterated her charge that the brawl concerning the Konrad shaft
had shown that Bonn was trying to transfer the entire jurisdiction
for granting permission for atomic waste facilities to the federal
government.

Children's Relief Organization: forbid child beating by parents
</H1>
 The German Children's Relief Organization has called on the federal
government to abrogate parental rights to beat their children.  The head
of the organization, Mr. Kroeger, told the NEUE OSNABRUECKER ZEITUNG the
family was the only domain left in society in which children could be
beaten with impunity.  The law in question, based on an old Prussian local
law,  could always harbor the danger of child abuse.

Plea for more consumer information
</H1>
The Agricultural Minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, Ms.
Hoehn, has stoked the flames of debate over the marking of beef. With the
background of the recent import scandal she demanded a certificate of
origin not just for meat, but also for sausage wares. A certificate will
be required by the EU as of January 1, 2000. Beyond that, Ms. Hoehn advocated more vigorous local marketing. That would make the process more
transparent to the consumer. Next week the Federal Agriculture, along with
those from the states, will meet in Husum. This topic will probably appear
on the agenda there.

Telekom: Connections more expensive, conversations less?
</H1>
The Telekom corporation, in the wake of the decision of Post
Minister Boetsch on the interconnection of telephone networks, is
considering a telephone rate increase for connections. According to a
spokesman for Telekom, possibilities include an increase in the basic
rate or in the access price. At the same time Telekom head Mr. Sommer
proposed a reduction, especially for long telephone conversations, in the
next year during an interview with the newspaper BILD am Sonntag. The fees
would go down about 5 percent. The savings would be more noticeable as the
time and distance of calls increased, Sommer said. Local calls would cost
the same 12 Pfennigs, and telephone information would become more
expensive to compensate.
Post Minister Boetsch decided yesterday that Telekom would have to charge
significantly less for leasing telephone lines to private competitors than
had been asked for.
