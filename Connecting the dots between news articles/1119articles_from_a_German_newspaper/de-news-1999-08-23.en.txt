Red-Green coalition's first Berlin meeting tonight
</H1>
The Red-Green coalition will hold their first Berlin meeting
tonight. Details of the ecological tax reform are the main issue
on the agenda. This afternoon, Chancellor Schroeder officially
inaugurated his Berlin activities this afternoon. The Red-Green
meeting in the provisional chancellor's office, located in
the former GDR government building, is not the kind of family
reunion like the recent SPD leadership meeting in Saarbruecken.
And the controversial issues between red and green are far from
being family affairs. The rigid economy program of finance
minister Eichel and the summer proposals for a 3-step tax model
or for hiking the Diesel fuel tax caused negative image impacts
right before important upcoming state elections. Some of
chancellor Schroeder's comrades expect him to be clear at last
on the matter of who's bossing the show. It is not clear,
however, whether this first workday of the government in Berlin
is the right time for a show of force.
Sarre state's premier Klimmt meanwhile stands pat on voting
against the economy package in the upper chamber.

Employers said to favor reduced job stability for the handicapped
</H1>
The federal association of employers wants to have a sharp look at
job stability for physically handicapped persons, according to
a report by the daily "Die Welt" who claim to have in their hands
a positioning paper of the association. Employers also demand a
reduction of the present 6% quota to a maximum of 5%. Also, in
view of the already extensive yearly vacations, the additional
5 days of leave for the handicapped should be abolished. According

Oezdemir demands long-range aid for Turkey after earthquake
</H1>
Green Bundestag member Oezdemir counts on a cross-party
consensus on allowing Turkish earthquake victims entrance
into Germany within the scope of family reunion. Talking to
radio Deutschlandradio in Berlin, Oezdemir said it was easy to
understand that Turks living in Germany would like to give
temporary shelter to members of their family. Following the
emergency aid measures, long-time aid should be extended
Turkey with suggestions of improving Turk building inspection.
The spontaneous willingness to extend aid especially among
Germans showed that Turkey belongs into Europe much more
than a lot of discussions in recent years, said the chairman
of the Turco-German parliamentary group.
Meanwhile, 13 German victims of the quake have been identified.
