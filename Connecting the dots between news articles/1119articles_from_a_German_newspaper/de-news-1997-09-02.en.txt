SPD warns against climate disaster
</H1>
Social Democrats have warned against a climate phenomenon called "El Nino".
El Nino is created by a strong warming of the Pacific Ocean at the

As a consequence, some areas are affected by drought, others by flooding.
SPD environmental politicians think that El Nino will not spare Europe and
predict heavy storms and rains next year. The Social-Democrats demand that
if necessary the government should act on its own to reduce the greenhouse
effect. Especially, it was necessary to reduce the emission of carbon
dioxide.
