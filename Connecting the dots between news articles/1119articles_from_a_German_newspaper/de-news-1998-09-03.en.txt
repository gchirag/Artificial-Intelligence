Schroeder: Kohl is unsuited for the future
</H1>
SPD challenger Schroeder called Chancellor Kohl "unsuited for
the future." After 16 years in power, Kohl is no longer able to
cluster the nation's creative capacities, Schroeder said during
the Bundestag general debate on the 1999 budget. The Chancellor
no longer perceives the situation of average wage earners, he
stressed. Kohl split the nation in a social sense by his policies.
In response, Union faction leader Schaeuble accused Schroeder of
having drawn a caricature of reality in his envy-filled speech.
But the social democrats would not succeed in inciting the Germans
against each other. he said Schroeder again made clear that he
stands for everything - and nothing at all.

Kohl: No political experiments
</H1>
Earlier, Chancellor Kohl had spoken out against trial and error
politics. The present course is predictable and must therefore
be held. Kohl defended the reconstruction work done in Eastern
Germany. The first part of his speech had mainly turned around
foreign policy matters. He said international trust was an
important potential for Germany and must not be put in jeopardy.

Employers don't give alliance for labor much of a chance
</H1>
In the opinion of Employers' Association's chairman Hundt, the "Alliance for
Labor" planned by SPD and the Greens for the
event of an election victory does not stand a chance in case
of a reversal of the job stability reduction and social security
reform.  Hundt voiced this opinion during a Bonn podium discussion
with unionist Riester, minister for labor designate of the SPD.
Riester countered that discussions about this kind of alliance
must be free from pre-conditioning by either side. Policy
should not be subject to blackmail.
