Unemployment hits new all-time high
</H1>
The number of unemployed topped 4.5 millions in December, a new all-time
high, according to the head of the Federal Labour Office, Mr Bernhard
Jagoda.

<P>
The much-touted reversal of the trend seemed to have vanished round the
corner, once again, or rather would have been flawed by the winter.
4,522,000 persons were registered unemployed at the end of 1997, up by
exactly 200,000 compared to November 1996, or 373,000 compared to
November 1996.

<P>
This bumped the unemployment-rate up to 11.8%, the highest rate in any
December - as far as the Labour Office's records go. The yearly average was
4,385,000 or 11.4%. It was moot if that meant that it had bottomed out - at
least in West Germany - as unemployment had crept up even after seasonal
factors had been taken out. In Bavaria, too, where there is an above-average
number of non-office jobs, unemployment went up by 39,000, bringing the
total up to 454,000 or 7.7%. The figures for Baden-Wuerttemberg and
Rhineland-Palatinate are: 166,700 (9.4%) and 378,100 (7.7%) respectively.

<P>
Mr Jagoda said that the economic upturn had done hardly anything for
employment.

Mr Kohl: halving unemployment till 2000 more than unlikely
</H1>
Windhagen/Wildbad Kreuth. For the first time Chancellor Kohl admitted that
it would be almost impossible to halve unemployment until the year 2000.
At the same time he was confident that economic growth at up to 3% would
make unemployment drop. He also predicted tough electioneering in the
upcoming election campaigns, and categorically denied any plans for a big
coalition (between his party and the SPD).

CSU meets behind closed doors
</H1>
Election strategies for the upcoming federal election (1998) was one of the
most important issues on the agenda for the CSU's meeting behind closed
doors. Other important items were European politics and the future common
European currency, the Bavarian Premier's pet-hate (though this was against
the official Bonn party-line). Today Luxembourg's head of state Junker
arrived in Wildbad Kreuth, to join the discussion. He thought that there
would be a decision on who will head the future European Reserve Bank within
the next few weeks. Mr Junker, however, ruled out that there would be a
third candidate - apart from Mr Duisenberg (who currently heads the European
Currency Institute) and Mr Trichet, head of the French Reserve Bank.
Mr Junker also refuted Mr Stoiber's warnings that Europe should not set up
transfer-payments similar to the current German ones. "No-one wants to do
that anyway, let's not bark up the wrong tree." Mr Junker was full of praise
for head of the Bavarian CSU, Mr Glos: Mr Glos had repeatedly spoken in
favour of the Euro. He had, however, also said that the Euro should only
take over if it was as strong as the German mark, or there would not be a
majority for it in parliament.

Mr Kanther against suspending Schengen Accord
</H1>
Federal Interior Minister Kanther once again declined to suspend the
Schengen Accord (which meant no border-checks within most of the European
countries). He referred to yesterday's decision by the six Accord
signatories' heads of police - plus Turkey's head of police -, and said they
were a useful reaction to Kurds fleeing Turkey to get into their countries.
The Minister visited Kehl, an important border-crossing between France and
Germany, to get first-hand experience on beefed-up border checks.

Arson-attacks against Turkish properties
</H1>
Early this morning two Turkish shops in Backnang were put to
the torch. According to the police, first a Turkish club-house that also
was being used by a mail-order business, went up in flames; a few hours
later, there was another arson-attack in the same street. More of the same
in Saxony's Anneberg-Buchholz: a Turkish restaurant burned down. Eight
persons had to be evacuated from adjoining houses.

Pigging-out - not exactly in style
</H1>
A 59-year old Munich man simply had to pig out on sausages - with
almost fatal consequences. He collapsed after wolving down a sausage
measuring 10 x 4 cms (about 4'' x 2'') - in one go. The emergency GP was
able to revive him after having pulled the sausage from his throat. The man
is still unconscious and will stay in intensive care.
