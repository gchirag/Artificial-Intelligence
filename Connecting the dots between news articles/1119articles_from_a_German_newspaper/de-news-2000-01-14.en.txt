Hesse's CDU: 13 million marks of "anonymous bequests" an accounting error
</H1>
Hesse's State Premier Koch admitted that some 13 million marks of monies
received by the state CDU-party between 1989 and 1996, did not come from
anonymous bequests, contrary to what had been alleged so far. When Mr Koch
spoke to the press at Hofheim, he called this "a black day" for the CDU.
The then head of the party Kanther confirmed, that the 12 million marks
actually had been reverse-transfers of monies previously 'parked' in a
foreign account. The foreign account allegedly still was some 17 million
marks in credit. Mr Koch did not know what had been going on at the time.

Mr Schaeuble: general public appreciates investigation efforts
</H1>
The executive of the CDU-party was more than concerned when they heard
about the latest revelations in Hesse's party-donations scandal. Head of
the party Schaeuble said on television ARD, that the general public saw
that the people in charge would bend over backwards to shed light on the
affair. This was hard and would hurt and there would be fresh suspicions,
but "we'll do it". Top-runner of the northern CDU Ruehe was glad that
Hesses's CDU had come clean. And he would keep backing Mr Schaeuble during
his upcoming election campaign
