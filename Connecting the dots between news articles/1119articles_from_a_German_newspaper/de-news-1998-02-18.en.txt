German soldiers 'used Nazi insults' against Albanians
</H1>
The Ministry of Defence is investigating new accusations of extreme
right-wing activity in the German army. According to a report on the
ZDF television channel, two German soldiers from the SFOR
peace-keeping force in Bosnia insulted Albanian soldiers, using Nazi
slogans. A spokesman for the Ministry admitted that it was possible
that two uncommissioned officers had used anti-Semitic insults against
two Albanian soldiers who were on guard in Bosnia last year. Up till
now, the ministry had claimed that the soldiers were very drunk, and
that it could not be proven that they had used such insults. Defence
Minister Ruehe's plan to check up on every soldier regularly for
possible extreme right-wing sympathies has come in for criticism.
Penner, an SPD politician who is the president of the Bundestag's
committee on internal affairs, has warned that this should not lead to
a general feeling of mistrust towards the army. Army Chief of Staff
Bagger has called on soldiers to show more courage in opposing
right-wing extremism, but he also warned against creating an
atmosphere of 'snooping on your comrades.'

CDU/CSU politicians say no to surveillance law exceptions
</H1>
Before the start of the mediation process on the new surveillance law,
the so-called 'great surveillance attack,' politicians from the
CDU/CSU have said that all exceptions to the law for members of
specific occupations that have been agreed up till now should be
scrapped. Manfred Kanther, the Minister of the Interior, emphasised in
an interview with the 'Berliner Morgenpost' newspaper, that there was
no possibility that further occupations might be exempted, and said
that he was ready to scrap the exemptions that had already been won by
the SPD, agreeing with what the leader of the CDU parliamentary party,
Wolfgang Schaeuble, has already said. The SPD rejected this
initiative. The mediation leader for the SPD, Schily, said that he
would think it somewhat adventurous for the CDU/CSU to believe that
the SPD would allow the exemptions to be scrapped and were hoping to
win more. The German Press Council has accused Schaeuble of wanting to
chip away at the freedom of the press and of hindering any attempts to
improve it.

Highest export surplus since German Unification
</H1>
The German economy's export surplus of more than DM 121 billion last
year was highest since the Re-unification of Germany. According to the
Federal Statistics Office, which is based in Wiesbaden, goods with a
value of more than DM 887 billion were exported in 1997; this was more
than 12.5% more than in the previous year. Around DM 765 billion worth
of goods were imported, which represents an increase of 10.9%. The
export boom, which was in part due to favourable exchange rates,
helped to halve the balance of payments deficit from 1996 to around DM
10 billion. Besides the export surplus, the balance of payments also
includes international money transfers and the money spent by German
holiday-makers.

Cull of thousands of cattle 'was unnecessary'
</H1>
It now seems likely that thousands of German cattle were destroyed in
error in connection with BSE. A report carried by the
'Deutschlandfunk' broadcasting company, based on information from the
Swiss Federal Veterinary Office, claims that mistakes were made in the
investigation into the first alleged case of BSE in cattle in Germany.
The disease was confirmed in the sample, but it has been proven that
the sample itself did not come from Bavarian cow with suspected BSE.
Following the investigation, 3,000 cattle of British and Swiss origin
were destroyed in Bavaria alone last year.

basic rights are not infringed if they are irritated by smoke in
public places. The court's judges did not even accept the complaint,
which was made by a non-smoker, for judgement. As justification for
their decision, the judges explained that parliament has passed

judgement announced yesterday, the Federal Labour Court decided that
employees with health problems have a right to work in a smoke-free
environment.

Chancellor Kohl is to receive the keys to London this evening, the
city's highest honour. In his speech for the occasion of the ceremony,
which has already been published, the Chancellor is to reiterate his
support for a punctual start to European Monetary Union. Some of the
British popular press were highly critical of the decision to honour
Kohl in this way; the honour is for his great engagement in the cause
of European integration. Conservative Members of Parliament raised
similar criticisms in the House of Commons (the lower house of the
British Parliament).
