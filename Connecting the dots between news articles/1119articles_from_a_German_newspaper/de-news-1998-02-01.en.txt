Number of immigrant ethnic Germans drops further
</H1>
The number of immigrant ethnic Germans in January has fallen again
in comparison to last year's figures. According to Mr. Waffenschmidt,
the Federal Government's Commissioner for Ethnic Germans, around 10,000
ethnic Germans immigrated to Germany last month. Last year the figure
was almost 15,000. More than 90 percent of the immigrants came from
states in the former Soviet Union. Mr. Waffenschmidt said that reasons
for the fall in numbers include German financial aid to Eastern and
South Eastern Europe and the introduction of German language tests.
Experience has shown that a third of the so-called ethnic Germans from
Russia and Kazachstan do not have the legally required knowledge of the
German language.

regarding the issuing of Abortion Consultation Certificates for pregnant
women. Bishop Engelhardt, the state bishop of Baden, said in an
interview with "Suedwestfunk" radio station that since the Pope's letter
to the Catholic Church there had also been moves within the Protestant
Church to find an alternative solution to the issuing of Abortion
Consultation Certificates for the authorising of legal abortions. Bishop
Engelhardt made it clear, however, that he saw no reason to call for
changes to Paragraph 218, the law governing abortion in Germany.

Health insurance schemes to cover cost of dentistry overseas
</H1>
Health insurance schemes would like to cover members' dentistry
costs for treatment overseas. A spokesman for the Federal Association
for the AOK (the state health insurance plan) said to the newspaper
"Bild am Sonntag" that the idea of covering dentistry costs incurred
overseas was attractive to the various state health insurance schemes,
as this could lower costs and increase competition. According to the
newspaper, politicians from the CDU/CSU and the SPD would be prepared to
support the move in parliament.
