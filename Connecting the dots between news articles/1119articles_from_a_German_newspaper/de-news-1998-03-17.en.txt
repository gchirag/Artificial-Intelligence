Johannes Rau to resign as State Premier in June
</H1>
North Rhein-Westphalia's State Premier Johannes
Rau announced yesterday his resignation with effect June 1. As
successor in his office he designated the State's Economics Minister,
Wolfgang Clement. With his decision Mr Rau hopes to increase SPD's
propects at the Federal elections [in Autumn] and to give -
after 20 years at the top of North Rhine-Westphalia's government -
politics in the state a new momentum. He rejected rumours his
decision was influenced by day-to-day politics.

<P>
The Social Democrats expect the change at the top of North
Rhine-Westphalia's government to increase their chances to
overthrow the current conservative government at the oncoming
elections to the Federal parliament in Autumn. The SPD's
secretary-general, Mr Muentefering, said the change of generations
will also boost the party's politics on the federal level. Leading
SPD politicians said Mr Rau's resignation is another signal to finally
bring down Chancellor Helmut Kohl. SPD's candidate for the chancellorship
Gerhard Schroeder called it an important and a right decision [of
Mr Rau to step down].

<P>
The designated new State Premier, Wolfgang Clement, announced he will
continue the coalition government with the Greens. Representatives
of the Social Democrats and the Greens in Duesseldorf also stressed
that the coalition will be maintained under the new State Premier.
Mr Clement said he assumes to succesfully continue the coalition.
For the Greens, Environment Minister Baerbel Hoehn said that although
there have been important disputes with the Economics Minister, it
should not be forgotten that Mr Clement was one of the architects of
the coalition of SPD and Greens [in North Rhine-Westphalia].

<P>
Mr Muentefering, who will become the new chair of North Rhine-Westphalia's
Social Democrats, announced he will give up his office as SPD's
secretary-general [at the federal level] after the federal elections
in Autumn. Meanwhile, some SPD members have suggested Mr Rau should
run for the office of German President in 1999.

<P>
From within the CDU/CSU, harsh criticism has been voiced of how the
SPD treated Mr Rau. Chancellor Helmut Kohl reproached SPD's candidate
for the chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder with hypocrisy. Only yesterday
Mr Schroeder had praised the merits of the parting State Premier.

Castor protests: Greenpeace occupies chimney of power station
</H1>
As protest against the upcoming Castor transports, some
25 members of the environmental organisation Greenpeace occupied
this morning the chimney of the coal power station in Walheim (in
the Ludwigsburg area). [Castor stands for "cask for storage and
transport of radioactive material".] According to a Greenpeace
spokes-person the action will continue for several days.

<P>
In Walheim, the Castor casks containing the used nuclear fuel elements
from the nuclear power station Neckarwestheim will be put on the rail.
Greenpeace assumes that the train with a total of six Castor casks,
three each from Neckarwestheim and the Bavarian Gundremmingen, will
arrive in the intermediate nuclear storage facility in Arhaus, North
Rhine-Westphalia, on March 25.

Kohl: Unemployment main campaign topic
</H1>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to make the fight against
unemployment CDU's main topic in its election campaign. After a
conference with 500 East German CDU officials, Mr Kohl announced
his full support of the election campaign in the New States. Mr Kohl
denied that there was any dispute in CDU's East German party groups
on the strategy for the campaign. The same applied to the State
elections in Saxony-Anhalt, considered as the key test before the
federal elections.

<P>
The CDU will present themselves as the party of Germany unity.
Contrary to earlier announcements, the introduction of the Euro
[the new European currency] will not be a main topic of the campaign,
according to Mr Kohl. The Chancellor said he has never believed that
the introduction of the Euro made a good campaign topic. Mr Kohl
also stressed that the "red socks" campaign against the PDS at
the previous elections will not be repeated.

<P>
Mr Kohl also denied rumours of his resignation and replacement by
faction leader Wolfgang Schaeuble. He and Mr Schaeuble will go into
this campaign together, and he will not, not even perhaps, resign as
leading candidate, stressed Mr Kohl.

Greens discuss petrol price again
</H1>
Within the Green party, a new discussion has broken out on
their decision to aim for a petrol price of DM5 per liter within
ten years. The secretary-general of the Greens' faction in the Bundestag
[lower house of parliament], Mr Schulz called for a correction of
this recent party conference decision. The increase in the petrol
price to DM5/liter was particularly hard to understand for the
people in East Germany. The Greens spokes-person Juergen Trittin
and the spokes-person of The Greens' faction, Ms Mueller, however,
supported the party conference decision. The head of The Greens in
the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Mr Buetigkofer said that as long as
the automobile industry did not sell a "three-liter car" the Greens
would not demand the increase in the petrol price to DM5/liter.

Euro car registration plates suffice within EU
</H1>
Cars with so-called Euro registration plates will no longer
need seperate nationality plates when travelling within the
European Union. [The Euro plates already contain a reference to the
state where the car is registered.] This change might already come
into effect before this year's summer holidays.
When travelling to non-EU countries, however, the seperate nationality
plate will remain obligatory.
