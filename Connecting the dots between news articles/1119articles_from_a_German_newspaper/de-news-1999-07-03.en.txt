Schroeder seems to have secured posts for his EU nominees
</H1>
According to "Der Spiegel," Chancellor Schroeder has been successful in
persuading the future president of the EU Commission, Romano Prodi, to
accept his nominees.  Schroeder wants Guenter Verheugen of the SPD to take
charge of EU foreign policy and Bernd Schreier of the Bavarian Greens to
handle the EU budget.  But Prodi told "Welt am Sonntag" that nothing is
definitive yet.  The biggest question is whether the EU Parliament will
ratify Schroeder's nominees.

Jagoda expects a decline in unemployment
</H1>
The Federal Labor Office anticipates a sizeable drop in the jobless rate
for the current year.  The Labor Office's president, Bernhard Jagoda, said
there is a good chance that unemployment will shrink to 4.1 million,
200,000 less than last year.  Jagoda thinks the economic outlook is
positive, and that there are signs of an upturn.  Optimism is also
widespread among the representatives of the government, the unions and the
employers that are having their next meeting of the "Alliance for Jobs" on
Tuesday.  This bodes well for their chances of coming to agreements on
part-time work for the elderly, overtime and job training.

Schroeder calls on SPD to support the administration's policies
</H1>
Schroeder has urged his party to actively support the administration's
course of reform.  Addressing the state party convention of the Berlin
SPD, Schroeder said the SPD should not be an idle bystander in the
continuing disputes between the red-green Coalition and the various
Germany lobbies. Schroeder said the upcoming reform of corporate taxation
will put Germany's tax levels in the lower third of all European
countries.  With this step, he said, politics will have made a real
contribution to the economy.  Schroeder vehemently defended the
Administration's austerity measures.  He said this was the only way to put
the country back on its feet.  Criticism by interest groups was all well
and good, said the Chancellor.  But the SPD is not the unions' to command.

Vice party chief Wolfgang Thierse has called on the SPD to work out a new
party platform.  In the news magazine "Der Spiegel," he made several
suggestions along these lines.  He said the party doesn't necessarily
require a more industry-friendly tilt, such as was recently called for by
Chancellor Schroeder and the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  Thierse
said on a B5-aktuell radio broadcast that the so-called Schroeder-Blair
strategy paper has resulted in new debate about the party platform.
Thierse stressed that the party must not lose sight of its fundamental
convictions.  He conceded, however, that the SPD will be walking a fine
line.  Much that would be desirable is impossible as a result of the
country's financial situation.  But Thierse insisted that, despite all the
cut-backs, the party has to make it clear that it still stands for social
justice and solidarity.

Rau in Brandenburg for inaugural visit
</H1>
The newly sworn-in Federal President, Johannes Rau, has just finished his
first official visit to the state of Brandenburg.  Rau took part in
"Brandenburg Day," a public celebration which drew over 100,000 people to
its rural festivities.  With this, the President departed from usual
practice of making inaugural state visits to large cities.  He chose the
small Brandenburg town of Jueterbog precisely because the fourth
"Brandenburg Day" was hosted there.

<P>
Just before to his trip, Rau said he was looking forward to making new
discoveries on this tour, to meeting people and sharing the joy of German
unity with them.  Rau said we should never forget the awe that German
unification inspired, and neither should we forget the joy, despite all
aggravation and disappointment that is still lurking here and there.  The
President demanded more credibility from politicians.  They should say
what they are doing, and do what they say.  Rau pledged to live by this
rule during his 5-year term.  10 years after the fall of the Wall, he
said, states are still divided into old and new.  Rau promised to listen
and to help the states get to know each other better through giving
speeches and discovering answers.  The goal, according to Rau, is to
establish conditions of equality throughout Germany.  But this does not
mean making all states the same.  Diversity is one of Germany's strengths,
said Rau, and he urged that it be maintained and encouraged.

Dual citizenship law not signed
</H1>
Roman Herzog, the departing Federal President, did not sign the
controversial immigration law reform because of time constraints.  This is
according to a statement put out by the Presidential Office, which
rejected a report by the news magazine "Focus" that Herzog didn't sign the
bill because of constitutional concerns.  President Herzog simply didn't
have sufficient time to scrutinize the law adequately before he left
office, the statement said.  According to "Focus," Herzog had
constitutional concerns centering on the section of the law that will make
immigrant children automatically lose their German passports if they do
not renounce their inherited foreign nationality by age of 22.

German Rail plans billions of marks in investments

The chairman of German Rail, Johannes Ludewig, is proposing to invest
almost 37 billion marks over the next six years for repair and expansion
of the railway network, according to "Der Spiegel."  Ludewig will present
his plan to the supervisory board on Wednesday, the report says.  Thus
far, German Rail has had little success with its plan to lure more traffic
off the roads and onto the trains.

measures were particularly welcomed by people with a net income of more
than DM 4500 per month.
