Harald Juhnke denies to have made racist remarks
</H1>
Harald Juhnke considers himself victim of a campaign to damage
his reputation. The actor has firmly denied accusations of having called a
black guard in Hollywood a "dirty nigger who would have been gassed under
Hitler" [translated back from German]. "I have never ever said this",
Mr Juhnke stressed.

<P>
The black guard who was allegedly insulted by Harald Juhnke will not
file charges against the actor. For Mr Juhnke's lawyer the case is
clear: even though his client was drunk, he could never have made
racist remarks because Mr Juhnke is known for being extremly
open-minded and liberal.

<P>
Meanwhile, the Berlin Prosecutor's Office is looking at
whether Mr Juhnke's remark is punishable by law. So far they have not
come up yet with a concrete result. A prosecutor's spokes-person said
it was not clear yet whether this might lead to an official investigation.

CDU/CSU politicians fear huge deficits in Federal budget
</H1>
Politicians from the CDU and CSU parties fear a deficit of several
billion DM in the Federal budget because of the high unemployment rate.
CDU financial expert, Mr Austermann, predicts deficits of five billion
marks not being covered by the budget, reports the tabloid BILD.
FDP budget expert, Mr Koppelin (sp?), said that Finance Minister Theo
Waigel might freeze all budgetary spending as early as next week. This,
however, would not be enough. In Mr Koppelin's opinion, Mr Waigel will
not be able to rebalance the budget without further cuts of, for example,
unemployment benefits. This would become absolutely clear in May at the
latest, when the next revenue forecast will come out.

Ahrens demands repair of structural deficits of health care system
</H1>

has demanded drastic changes in the health care system to overcome
its structural deficits.

<P>
On DEUTSCHLANDRADIO BERLIN radio Mr Ahrens said the legislative
must make it possible for public health insurance funds to save, for
example, on medicaments. Public health insurances could save about DM6bn
to DM7bn if they had not to reimburse for medicaments whose
effectiveness cannot be shown. A possibility for further
savings were some 20% of in-patients who could as well receive out-patient
treatment.
