Governing coalition seeks compromise with Social-Democrats on pension
</H1>
labor Minister Norbert Bluem justified the raise in pension contributions.
>From next January on contributions will rise from 20.3% to 21% of the
income before taxes, if the Bundesrat does agree.

<P>
The raise grieves him too, said Mr. Bluem, but it was necessary. In August
and September a dramatic drop in contributions occured, caused, so Mr.
Bluem, by early retirement, transformation of social security
contribution-liable jobs into DM610-jobs, and, predominantly, high
unemployment. Therefore, he called upon employers to hire more people. The
government will do their best to prevent the raise.

<P>
Bluem stated he was in favor of raising the sales tax. He called upon
the Social Democrats to cooperate. The Social-Democrats signaled readiness
for discussions. The SPD's federal executive officer Franz Muentefering
said, the party had several proposals. Tomorrow, Lower Saxony's State
Premier Gerhard Schroeder will propose to raise the sales tax by one
percent not in 1999 but as soon as possible.

<P>
Today, the Cabinet also approved changes of the stock market code. The
changes aim at attracting foreign investors. Additionally, the initiation
of data exchange between social security and unemployment offices on one
side, and insurers on the other, was decided. This shall help to prevent
social security fraud.

Cabinet pass resolution on improved climate protection
</H1>
The Cabinet passed a program on emmission reduction. By the year
2005 emmission of carbon dioxide is to be reduced by 25% compared to 1990's
amount.

<P>
Furthermore, the government will promote renewable energy, improved
insulation of buildings, and an increased utilization of power-heat
coupling by industries and communities. With regard to the introduction of
environmentally responsible technologies Environment Minister Angela Merkel
relies on the industry. Social-Democrat Peter Mueller said the federal
governments list was just a letter to Santa Claus. In no country was the
difference between desire and reality as large as in Germany, said Mueller.
The Greens called the government's environmental policy piece-meal stuff
and demanded an ecological tax reform.

Law suits against nursing insurance dismissed
</H1>
The Federal Social Court dismissed several suits that had been filed
against the nursing insurance that was introduced in 1995. The law did not
violate the constitution, the judges said. The suits were mostly against
the regulation that people do not have a free choice among the insurers.
This would cause different contribution rates also for the nursing
insurance. The judges rejected these objections. There was a connection
between health insurance and nursing insurance because the risk of
requiring nursing is a consequence of the health risk.

Legal status of Scientology remains unclear
</H1>
The legal status of Scientology in Germany remains unclear. The Federal
Administrative Court in Berlin today repealed the verdict of a lower court.
The Mannheim Administrative Court had declared Scientology to be mainly a
business-oriented institution, but did not touch its status as a registered
association arguing that Scientology might also be a religious community.
The judges in Berlin called upon the lower court to check whether
Scientology's main purpose is indeed to make business. Then the status as a
registered association could be withdrawn, no matter if Scientology is a
religious community or not. This case was about a Scientology section in
Stuttgart.

Dismissal due to Hitler signature declared lawful
</H1>
Immediate dismissal of double bass player Gerd
Reinke (sp?) was confirmed by a Berlin labour court.
Last May, Reinke signed a bill with "Adolf Hitler"
while on concert tour in Israel.
<P>
The musician had been employed by the "Deutsche Oper"
for 20 years; immediate and outright dismissal is
a very heavy penalty - said the presiding judge.
But it was the only action that could have been taken.
Reinke is fully responsible for the whole affair
and must bear this responsibility. His "Hitler"-
signature gravely impaired the good name of the
Opera and of Berlin State. The musician considered
the sentence to be very heavy. He said he had hoped
to be able to return to work at the Opera - now
he will have to let things drift and try to muddle
through.

limitations of the constitutional right of religious
freedom.
