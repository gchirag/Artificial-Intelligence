</H1>

million.  The Federal Labor Office at Nuremberg informed today that the rate
rose in December to 10.8%, from 10.3% in the previous month.  The Office's
President, Mr. Jagoda, did not rule out that in the course of the next months,
up to 4.5 million people could be without jobs.

Government and unions to resume negotiations
</H1>
Before journalists in Bonn, Chancellor Kohl emphasized today that halving the
unemployment rate by the year 2000 remains a paramount goal of German Interior
policy.  Mr. Kohl and DGB [National Trade Union Federation] chairman
Mr. Schulte voiced principal interest in resuming summit talks between
government, employers and unions.  Mr. Kohl said he is open for another try at
the Chancellor's round table discussion which failed in 1996.  He cautioned,
however, that such talks only make sense if none of the participating parties
impose preconditions.  DGB chairman Mr. Schulte is less enthusiastic about
these so-called Chancellor rounds, and suggests talks under DGB patronage,
inviting government, opposition, and employers to meet with the DGB in spring
in Berlin.  In the eyes of the Social Democrats, the high unemployment
threatens social stability.  The economics spokesman of the SPD parliamentary
group, Mr. Schwanhold, explained that Germany needs an initiative for more
growth and employment.

CSU split about position toward FDP
</H1>
At the CSU convention in Wildbad Kreuth, an internal dispute arose about how to
proceed in the clash with the FDP.  The bone of contention is a statement made
by Minister President Stoiber of Bavaria accusing the FDP of social
heartlessness.  CSU Secretary General, Mr. Protzner, had distanced himself
from that statement by saying it would not reflect the opinion of the CSU.  He
continued that one could not use the FDP as scapegoat for all the unpopular
sides of the austerity measures.  Stoiber's response spoke of a boomerang by
Protzner and he maintained his criticism, saying the FDP has not always been
guided by social justice when debating the topics of solidarity tax, lay-off
protection, and store opening hours.  Stoiber added the FDP doesn't need to
CSU Secretary General to defend itself.  The Bavarian Finance Minister,
Mr. Huber, too, repeated his rebuke against the FDP.

Clement sees potential for red-green coalition
</H1>
Clement of the SPD in North Rhine-Westphalia sees a potential for a
red-green coalition after the next federal parliamentary elections.  SPD and
Alliance 90/The Greens have more overlaps than is commonly realized,
Mr. Clement said during a discussion with the parliamentary group of Alliance
90/The Greens in Woerlitz near Dessau.  This also holds for North
Rhine-Westphalia where SPD and Alliance 90/The Greens constitute the
government.

Bisky knew about Stasi activity of Harnisch
</H1>
The PDS [Party of Democratic Socialism, successor of former GDR socialist
state party] chairman Mr. Bisky was informed about the Stasi [former GDR
intelligence agency] engagement of party spokesman Mr. Harnisch.  Mr. Bisky
told the newspaper "Berliner Tageszeitung" that in remaining faithful to his
principles, he preferred consulting personally with Mr. Harnisch and viewing
the matter in a differentiated way.  Until he sees the Harnisch file at the
Gauck agency [agency archiving files of former Stasi members], there is no
need for a rushed decision, Mr. Bisky said.  Yesterday, Mr. Harnisch had
admitted to his engagement as so-called 'informal collaborator' [civil
undercover agent].  He had spied on the GDR writers Ms. Marn and
Ms. Lange-Mueller, Harnisch conceded in the newspaper.  Alliance 90/The Greens
and the chairman of the Public Radio Council of the East German Radio
Brandenburg have demanded Harnisch's resignation.

IG Metall does no longer categorically oppose 'Opening Clause'
</H1>
The IG Metall [union for metal industry, engineering and electronics] is no
longer categorically opposed to the so-called 'Opening Clause' sought by
employers.  [The 'Opening Clause' would allow individual companies to reach a
wage agreement outside the traditional industry-wide collective bargaining
system.]  The union's vice president, Mr. Riester, said in the newspaper
"Stuttgarter Nachrichten" that exceptions can be justified to protect jobs, if
both parties agree.  He added that such a special procedure could not be left
to the companies to decide, since otherwise the industry-wide collective
bargaining system would break down.

General Motors and Volkswagen want to conclude discord
</H1>
The car manufacturers General Motors and Volkswagen are trying to reach an
out-of-court settlement in the conflict about the former executive Mr. Lopez.
As Lopez's attorney said in Washington today, General Motors will drop the
civil lawsuit against Mr. Lopez, filed in the U.S.  Accordingly, the damages
suit against Volkswagen will be revoked.  It is said that in return, VW will
cover attorney and legal fees accrued so far and has made a long-term pledge
to buy parts from companies of the General Motors Corporation.  If the lawsuit
had been successful, Volkswagen would have had to expect to pay several
billion Dollars.  Although both corporations confirmed the negotiations, none
of them wanted to comment on details.  Mr. Lopez had switched from General
Motors to Volkswagen in 1993, and had quit the latter position in November
1996.  His former employer accuses him of having taken secret documents with
him.  In Germany, the Public Prosecution at Darmstadt has indicted Mr. Lopez
for industrial espionage.

Trial against alleged Reemtsma kidnapers has begun
</H1>
This morning, the trial against the two alleged Reemtsma kidnapers,
Mr. Richter and Mr. Kositsch, has begun before the Hamburg Regional Court.
Heir of an industrial millionaire, Mr. Reemtsma had been abducted roughly 10
months ago and was released for a ransom of DM 30 million.  He stated in an
interview he wants to follow the trial with an 'armed eye' as he put it and he
sees with satisfaction that now the perpetrators bear the handcuffs and not
he.  In court, Mr. Reemtsma does not only appear as witness but also as
co-plaintiff.  On March 25, he had been knocked down in front of his house and
was taken hostage for 33 days.  After a ransom of 30 million DM was paid, the
kidnapers released the intellectual millionaire heir.  A few weeks later,
Mr. Kositsch and Mr. Richter were arrested in the South of Spain.  Mr. Richter
who is said to have handled telephone negotiations for the hand-over of the
money is only accused as accomplice which carries a minimum penalty of two
years.  Mr. Kositsch, whose criminal record already contained several armed
robberies, faces at least five years of prison.  He is said to have been
directly involved in the hand-over of the money packet, weighing 40kg, in
Krefeld.  Thomas Drach, the alleged mastermind of the gang is still fugitive.
A large part of the ransom is also still missing.

Third stage of Health Care reform to be adjusted
</H1>
According to newspaper reports, the third stage of the Health Care System
reform might not go into effect in its present form.  The newspapers
"Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung" and "Westfaelische Rundschau" wrote that the
draft by Minister of Health Seehofer shall be defused.  Patients would not be
required to pay a larger share of the cost of medications, hospital care,
rehabilitation measures, and dental services even if the insurers increase
their premiums.  According to the news articles, the coalition thinks that
Seehofer's proposal would punish the patients rather than the insurance
companies.  At the beginning of the election campaign, this could hardly be in
the interest of Chancellor Kohl, the papers said.
