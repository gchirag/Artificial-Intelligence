Pension debate: SPD and unions still disagree
</H1>
The SPD faction of the Bundestag and the unions have not been able
to come to an agreement about the government's plans for the pension
system. After a four-hour talk in the Reichstag the president of the SPD
faction Peter Struck said that the two parties remained firm on their
positions. Struck announced that the Cabinet would decide tomorrow that for
the next two years, pensions would be raised only in line with inflation
rate [and not in line with average income increases]. However, he did not
want to exclude that plans might change. More talks with the unions are
planned while the bill is passed into law.
Immediately before the talks, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made clear that
the government would remain firm on its plan to raise pensions only in line
with inflation rate. The vice-president of the employees union, Freitag,
however said in a radio interview that he thought there was still room for
negotiations in the pension discussion.

withstand the pressures from society and to stick to its policy of
austerity. The bank economists write in their latest monthly report that
short-term successes were not enough. The government had to make lasting
improvements to government finances by undertaking a medium-term
finance-political strategy. According to the central bank, the austerity
plans by Finance Minister Hans Eichel are a step into the right direction,
but more consolidation measures had to follow.

The SPD deputy president Rudolf Scharping wants to complete the

since the 1989 German re-unification. Some examples were the global
interwoven economy and the end of the East-west conflict. The
Social-Democrats wanted a government that concentrates on the core tasks,
