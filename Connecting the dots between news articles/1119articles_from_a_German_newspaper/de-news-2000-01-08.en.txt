The retirement age will apparently be lowered
</H1>
The retirement age will apparently be lowered.  Chancellor Schroeder has
suggested such a change in a compromise paper that is supposed to be
discussed tomorrow at an Alliance for Jobs meeting.  IG Metall head Klaus
Zwickel described the meeting as the last chance to agree on a retirement
age of 60.  At the same time he signaled a readiness to compromise.  The
chairman of the German Federation of Public Employees, Mr. Geier, says the
Alliance has gone nowhere.  He told the magazine "Focus" that Alliance for
Jobs meetings were little more than coffee klatches.

CDU/CSU agrees on a top tax bracket of 35%
</H1>
The CDU/CSU wants to lower taxes on German citizens and businesses by 50
billion marks annually.  CSU head Edmund Stoiber laid the idea out at the
close of the CSU meeting in Wildbad Kreuth.  "The essential core of our plan
is: a net cut of 50 billion marks to be made in two parts, with the second
part becoming effective in 2003; a sizeable lowering of the income tax; a
top rate of 35% on income tax; and a reorganization of the corporate tax
with a tax rate on retained profits of about 35%."

<P>
Finance Minister Hans Eichel (SPD) criticized the CDU/CSU proposal.  He
said the plan could not be financed and would come apart at the seams.

CDU comes out against full EU membership for Turkey
</H1>
The CDU has come out against full membership for Turkey in the EU.  It
feels that a new form of membership should be found for countries whose
territory lies only partly in Europe.  CDU chief Wolfgang Schaeuble said
in Norderstedt that the decision to offer Turkey full membership was
premature.

Is Kohl intriguing against Schaeuble?
</H1>
A newspaper article about apparent intrigues by former Chancellor Helmut
Kohl against present CDU party chief Wolfgang Schaeuble has set off the
usual confusion and embarrassment.  In the mean time, several leading
politicians denied the report.  The "Sueddeutsche Zeitung" said that Kohl
has made moves to put the party chief of North Rhine-Westphalia, Juergen
Ruettgers, up against Schaeuble as a challenger.  Ruettgers himself
described this as "nonsense."  However, Schaeuble has conceded in an
interview he gave to the news magazine "Der Spiegel" that he has had some
differences with Kohl.

Hombach comes under pressure
</H1>
Bodo Hombach, the EU coordinator for the Balkans has come under enormous
criticism from within the ranks of his own organization.  The EU
Commission told "Der Spiegel" that it is not happy with Hombach's work and
especially with his demands for money.  His annual salary is 464,000 DM.
Under pressure from Berlin, an special supplement of 74,000 marks per
month was approved, in addition to over 35,000 marks in entertainment
expenses. Critics charge that not even Romano Prodi, the head of the
European Commission, gets paid that much.  Brussels authorities limited
Hombach's international flights and declined to put an armored vehicle at
his disposal.  Berlin will pay for it instead.  The cost will be around
68,000 DM
per year.

Fire breaks out at FC Bayern Muenchen's training facilities in Munich
</H1>
A fire that broke out at the training facilities of FC Bayern Muenchen caused
more than a million marks in damage.  The question now facing the team is
whether they can continue to use the training center or whether they have
to move for a few weeks.  The fire devastated the locker rooms, the sauna,
the showers and the fitness center.  One way to avoid moving would be to
use the training center of the Lions, which is only a couple hundred meters
from the FC Bayern Muenchen training center.  Questioned by "Antenne
Bayern," the Lion's trainer, Werner Lorant, would only grumble "no comment."
Lion fans are of course dead set against FC Bayern players being on their
turf.
