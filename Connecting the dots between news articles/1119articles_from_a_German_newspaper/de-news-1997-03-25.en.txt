Rallies in Frankfurt
</H1>
Speaking to more than 20,000 demonstrators, chief of metal and engineering
union IG Metall Klaus Zwickel demanded a limit to the banks' power. He said
"casino-capitalism has become a threat to the public". He reproached
especially Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank that had secretly planned a
hostile take-over of Thyssen by Krupp-Hoesch behind the backs of those
concerned. Now was the time to raise the issue of the banks' power and its
abuse. Zwickel remains concerned about jobs even after Krupp denounced
taking over Thyssen. Meanwhile, negotiations about a merger of both
companies develop. Thyssen is to assume the entrepreneurial leadership in
the merged company.

</H1>

has a majority, Schaeuble said in an article in the weekly Die Zeit.
The performance by SPD in relation to tax reform was hardly ridiculous any
more, the politician commented. Schaeuble added that CDU/CSU was open for
talks even during the Easter break.

Welfare Federation demands higher social assistance payments
</H1>
According to plans of the Welfare Federation social assistance recipients
should get significantly more money. Further, each recipient should have to
deal with only one authority in future. Earlier, Finance Minister Theo
Waigel had suggested to reduce social assistance programmes even more to
meet requirements for the Euro stability pact. The Welfare Federation
accused Waigel of loss of social sensitivity and warned against sacrificing
social security on the European altar. Instead, the Federation demands the
restructuring of the welfare system arguing that the system that was set up
for emergency situations of individuals is now overstrained. Since 1980 the
number people on welfare has almost tripled. At the end of 1995 just over
2.5 million people received social assistance. As welfare payments have
fallen below the subsistence minimum the Welfare Federation demands a basic
social assistance related to actual requirements. This would mean increases
of 37 percent and more. The costs of DM15billion annually are to be covered
by limiting spousal tax reductions.

industry have continued negotiations for the 1.3 million construction
workers. It is the third round of bargaining. However, the Union for
Construction, Agriculture and Environment and the Federation of the German
Construction Industry showed little optimism at the start of the talks
which are scheduled for a two day period. Main issue has been so far a
regulation to replace payments for bad weather periods. Both parties have
made different offers. Regarding wages, the union demands increases to
match inflation. The parties also discuss 13th-month payments that
employers want to cut by 50 percent.
