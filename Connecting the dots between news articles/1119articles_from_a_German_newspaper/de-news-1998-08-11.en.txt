No further nuclear waste transports for the time being
</H1>
There will be no further nuclear waste transports in Germany before the
general elections in September, announced Federal Minister for the
Environment Angela Merkel. The current transport ban would not be lifted
for the time being. It was not clear yet, how the transport containers were
contaminated and how such contamination could be prevented in future.
Today, the federal Cabinet adopted a report by the environment ministry
about the safety of nuclear power stations in Germany. In the report, Mrs.
Merkel commended the safety standard of German nuclear plants which has
always been updated to the latest technological level. The security level
of nuclear plants was no argument to end nuclear energy as several
interested parties have demanded. The report was the first of its kind and
must be updated every three years by the federal government to meet
standards set by the Nuclear Safety Convention. This morning, the
environment ministry had rejected a report by the tabloid Bild that more
than 2030 reportable errors occurred during the past ten years.

importance of an increasing investment in the building and the extension
of roads in Germany. Rail track investments had to be kept on a high
level as well. The CDU politician rejected the plans of the Greens and
the Social Democrats to cut spending on transportation infrastructure.

only be kept competitive if enough money was invested in a modern
infrastructure.

The World Fair EXPO 2000 will not be exempted from Value Added
Tax (VAT), according to a statement of the government spokesperson,
Mr Hauser. Mr Hauser said an exemption would violate tax laws. This
statement indicates that a majority of the cabinett must have turned
down a corresponding request from Federal Economics Minister Guenter
Rexrodt. Mr Rexrodt had called for the exemption for EXPO 2000 ticket
sales in view of serious financial problem of the fair. By selling
an estimated 40 million of tickets, the fair could have saved more than
DM250 million this way.

Media commission: Germany still a multi-media developing country
</H1>
In important areas of information technologies, Germany is still
a developing country, according to the final report of the investigation
committee of the Bundestag (lower house of parliament) for the future
of media. The Head of the commission said the small number of schools
connected to the Internet revealed a striking gap. The commission fears
the loss of hundreds of thousands jobs if Germans will not rapidly
increase their knowledge of applications of computers and modern
communication technologies. Although an excellent infrastructure
exists, far too few computer services are being offered. In Germany,
21,000 new computer scientists per year are needed. However, only
10,000 computer science study places at universities are offered,
and moreover, only half of them are filled.
