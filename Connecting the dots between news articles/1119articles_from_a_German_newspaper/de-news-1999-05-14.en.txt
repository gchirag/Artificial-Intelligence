Serbian media: NATO air-raid killed more than 100 civilians
</H1>
According to Serbian sources, a NATO air-raid on the township of Korisa
in the Kosovo region killed more than 100 civilians - mainly refugees.
Also some 50 civilians, mostly women and children, were hurt, according
to Serbian state TV. The media accused NATO of having used so-called
splinter-bombs. The Alliance said they would follow up the allegations.
Preliminary investigations, however, did not come up with any indications
that NATO airplanes had been involved in this attack. In Bulgaria another
misguided rocket had hit the capital of Sofia. Sources in Sofia said the
rocket had markings in Cyrillic

Mr Clinton defends intensified air-raids
</H1>
US President Clinton vehemently defended intensified NATO air-raids on
Yugoslavia. He told officers in Washington that the attacks were justified
from a moral point of view, and that they would continue if Belgrade did not
give in and comply with the Alliance's requests. A NATO spokesperson
backed that, ruling out an armistice in the Kosovo region. Defence Minister
Scharping called reports of a partial withdrawal of the Yugoslavian army
an attempt to fool the public. He repeated that he was against an
armistice.

</H1>
The SPD parliamentary group so far has not decided if and how they will

proposals, and they were common knowledge. The spokesperson reacted to a
newspaper report alleging that the heads of the parliamentary group planned
to exempt newspaper delivery persons, kitchen helpers and cleaners working
in private households.

Collective lawsuit of former forced labourers against Dresdner Bank
</H1>
Some 22,000 former Polish concentration camp inmates want the Dresdner Bank
to pay 5.4 billion marks in damages for imprisonment and unpaid work. 2700
collective applications have been filed with the Frankfurt District Court.
They think that the bank had been an important accessory because of its
dominant position as SS-bank during the Third Reich. In the United States,
textile conglomerate Hugo Boss and 21 other - mostly German - companies have
been taken to court asking for damages for having employed forced labour
during the Third Reich.
