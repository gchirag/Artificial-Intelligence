Mr Toepfer gets job at UN's Environmental Agency
</H1>
Federal Minister of Building and Construction Toepfer supposedly will finish
his job at the end of this year, to take up his new position with UNEP,
the United Nations' environmental agency, as German Press Agency dpa
reported, quoting the Ministry. No decision has been made so far about his
successor, though it is more than likely going to be a CSU-person: as
current Post Minister Boetsch, CSU, will be out of a job at the end of
this year (his ministry will cease to exist), the CSU had asked to get
another ministry in return.

Opposition parties against reform of penal law
</H1>
SPD and Alliance 90/Greens are against the reform of penal law, as
drafted by government, according to this morning's final debate in
parliament. Opposition parties claimed the draft was raising penalties while
tarring all with the same brush. Therefore they proposed to pass the part on
the protection of children against sexual attacks, for the time being.
Spokes-persons for government, however, said the reforms were setting a new
direction.

<P>
According to Federal Minister of Justice Schmidt-Jorzig, the prime concern
of the draft was the effective protection of victims. And that was why, in
the case of sexual attacks on children, the offender would only be granted
bail if they were more than likely not to re-offend.

Federal government's fiscal policy criticised
</H1>
Government's fiscal policy was criticised by the SPD once again.
Mr Diller, of the SPD, called the 1997 additional budget and the 1998 budget
a raft of stop-gap measures, an emergency-operation intended to make sure
government made it till the upcoming federal elections. Additional net debt
was up to almost 71 billion marks, though it was intended to go down to
56 billion marks in 1998.

Deficit close to 3.1%
</H1>
The so-called 5 economic gurus predicted the German deficit to get
close to 3.1%, slightly above the Maastricht threshold of 3%. They also
stated that the above percentage had only been achieved by short-term
measures to plug budget-deficits. So far government had always maintained
they would meet the 3.0% threshold.

<P>
The 5 experts also asked politicians, unions and employers to change tack in
view of the existing economic situation. Lowering taxes would be of
paramount importance. Unions and employees should keep doing what they had
done in the past, i.e. go for moderate wage-rises. This year's growth is
expected to be 2.5% whereas it will be 3% in 1998.

Four years' jail for smuggling people
</H1>
A 43-year old man from Turkey was sentenced to four years jail
in one of the biggest trials of persons accused of smuggling foreigners into
the EC. He was convicted of two counts of organised smuggling, two counts of
having been an accessory and one count of having attempted to smuggle
persons. Originally the prosecution had tried to take him to court for
having smuggled several hundred, or, according to border-guards, several
thousand people, but there was not enough evidence for the latter.

New blood-alcohol levels for drivers
</H1>
The coalition-parties used their majority to pass a law on
blood-alcohol levels in parliament. If you are caught with a blood-alcohol
level of .5 per thousand, this will cost you 200 marks in fines and earn you
two black marks in the central register of traffic-fines. You will only lose
your licence if you pass the .8 per thousand threshold. A new breathalyzer
will be used to decide on levels - doing away with the current system of
taking blood-samples. And there is news for low-speed zones (30kph):
near schools and kindergartens the limit will only apply during the day.
Minister of Transportation Wissmann thought this would hassle motorists a
bit less, the opposition parties, however, said it would encourage drivers to
step on it.
