Five German Soldiers Injured by Land Mines in Kosovo
</H1>
A Turkish soldier was killed in explosions in Kosovo. Five German soldiers
and two other Turkish soldiers were injured. Both incidents occurred in the
German KFOR sector. The soldiers apparently crossed into an unmarked mine
field during a routine patrol along the border between Yugoslavia and
Albania. When one of the men walking in the rough terrain stepped on a land
mine, it immediately exploded. A spokesperson said that two German soldiers
suffered severe injuries and three others received minor injuries. KFOR
assured that none of the injuries were life-threatening. The soldiers were
immediately flown by rescue helicopters to a field hospital in Prizren.

Fischer's First Speech to UN General Assembly
</H1>
Federal Foreign Minister Fischer held his first speech before the UN General
Assembly. In the speech, he called upon the UN to take on more responsibility
and to intervene in conflicts more quickly. In ARD and ZDF Television's joint
morning magazine show, Fischer reiterated his position. "The position,
primarily concerning the question of humanitarian intervention, is shared by
General Secretary Annan as well as many other speakers. It is a discussion
that arose from practical experience, above all from the drastic experiences
that we had in parts of Africa and in Haiti, but also with the very
depressing experiences, for example with genocide in Rwanda, in Kosovo and
now in East Timor. And out of these, the necessity for conflict prevention or
- when conflicts arise, when mass deportation, genocide occurs - the
necessity for intervention becomes a more and more pressing problem. And it
must not be allowed to fail because of rifts in the Security Council. This is
a topic that we did not invent, but rather one that was found, and to which
we made our contribution."
