More NATO air-raids against Yugoslavia
</H1>
At noon air-alarms sounded once again in the capital of Kosovo.
Previously bombers hat left from Great Britain for another mission against
Yugoslavia. The huge planes featuring eight turbines each carry Tomahawk
cruise-missiles. They first flew over the Atlantic, and are expected to
enter a holding-pattern over the Mediterranean later on. The B52s can stay
airborne for up to 20 hours and will be re-fuelled in flight. Yesterday
planes left Fairford in the morning, and attacked in the evening. Main
targets of last night's attack were the airports of Belgrade, Podgorica and
Nicz. There were also explosions in Kraljevo. This is the first time the
Serbian armed forces also mentioned casualties. Meanwhile Yugoslavian
armed forces reported that about 40 targets had been hit, some of which
were of a non-military nature. Apparently NATO wanted to bomb and kill as
many civilians as possible, according to the Yugoslavian armed forces. A
police station in Kosovo allegedly had been flattened by two cruise-missiles,
and, according to news agency Tanjug, two rockets had hit a barrack, though
there had been no casualties, only material damage.

<P>
There had also been big explosions and hits in the capital of Belgrade,
including civilian sites, according to radio reports. Now the streets are
deserted and outdoor life has practically come to a standstill.

Last night US president Clinton addressed the Serbian people. He defended
the NATO air-raids and blamed Mr Milosevic for them. His speech was
broadcast by CNN television, available in Yugoslavia by satellite.

Reactions to Agenda 2000 compromise
</H1>
The German Farmers' Association is happy with the Agenda 2000
compromise, just like German business. The compromise provides for staggered
cuts to the prices of milk and wheat. In return, the EU will pay German
farmers less. Head of the EU Council Schroeder said this morning: "I don't
think we've come to Berlin for nothing. We've been able to prove once again
that the EU can act, strengthened it and certainly done our bit to make sure
that the people in the member-countries take a more positive look at the EU
than they used to in the last weeks. In a nutshell, it was worth it."

<P>
The CDU/CSU parliamentary group criticised the result of the Berlin meeting
as not being enough. Head of CDU Schaeuble said the results, especially as
far as agriculture was concerned, did not match expectations. In spite of
spending a lot of money, German farmers had to bear burdens no other part
of society would have to.
