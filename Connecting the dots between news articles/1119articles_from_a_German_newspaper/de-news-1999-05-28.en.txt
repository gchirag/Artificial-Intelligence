Duesseldorf Upper Regional Court rules against discrimination
</H1>
According to a ruling by the Duesseldorf Upper Regional Court, foreign
taxi-drivers are not to be excluded by dispatchers from doing certain rides.
Since 1997 a Duisburg taxi company had offered customers a special 'service',
namely providing ethnic German taxi-drivers, if requested. Several Turkish
taxi-drivers had gone to court as they thought this meant discrimination.
The court ruled that this 'service' would have breached the equal rights of
all taxi-drivers.
