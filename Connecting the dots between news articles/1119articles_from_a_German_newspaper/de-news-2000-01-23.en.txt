Helmut Kohl's statement false
</H1>
Unknown people have spread a statement allegedly from former Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.  The statement was that Kohl was now willing to reveal the
names of individuals who had donated money to the Christian Democratic
party (CDU).  A speaker for the CDU however said that this statement did
not originate from Kohl.  This was also confirmed by Kohl's office. The
statement, which had been sent by fax to several news agencies, said that
Kohl would be willing to reveal the names of the donors before a
committee.  This committee would have to be made up of high-ranking
individuals, such as Federal President Johannes Rau and the President of
the Bundestag, Mr. Thierse.

Finance scandal: New accusations against the CDU
</H1>
The Finance scandal in which the CDU finds itself continues to grow. The
ARD television channel claims that there is still more wrong doing in
conjunction with the sale of Leuna-Werke to the French government owned
company, Elf Acquitaine.  Paris supposedly gave 30 million DM to the
CDU's election coffers, a financial shot in the arm from Kohl's friend,
the late, Ex-President Francois Mitterand.  Helmut Kohl immediately
denied the report.  He denounced it as having been totally fabricated,
lies and called it a high point in the smear campaign against him.  It
became known as recently as December that important documents on Leuna
had been mislaid in the Chancellor's office during Kohl's term.  In
Berlin, the Presidium of the CDU is dealing with the final report of the
review of the Union's finances.
