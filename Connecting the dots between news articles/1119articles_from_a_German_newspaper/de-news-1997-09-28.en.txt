Breakthrough in negotiations for "part-time" pensioners
</H1>
A breakthrough in the negotiations regarding pensioners working
part time was reached early this morning. This was announced by Dieter
Spoeri, the arbitrator for the negotiations and the former Minister of
Economics for Stuttgart. The negotiations will most probably be a pilot
agreement for the German metal industry.

<P>
A settlement was reached as the bargaining parties found the following
compromise to the controversial issue: If businesses and work committees
cannot reach an agreement on the introduction of part-time employment, all
employees will have the right to work part-time form the age of 61.
Part-time pensioners will receive 82 percent of their last full-time salary
for the period that they work part time. Employers who wish to introduce a
part scheme allowing employees to retire between the ages of 60 and 63,
will receive compensation for the lost jobs (up to a maximum of three
full-time monthly salaries). The negotiating partners said that no-one had
either won or lost by this agreement. In fact, the winner was Germany as a
place of employment, as labour disputes and associated problems had thus
been averted.

<P>
Mr. Stumpfe, the president of the Employers Association for
the Metal Industry, says that the agreement regarding part-time work for
pensioners reached in North Wuerttemberg/North Baden should be applied to
the whole of Germany. Norbert Bluem, the Federal Minister of Labour has
also appealed to negotiators in other industries to also reach agreement in
this regard.

Lafontaine wants to revive the "Employment Pact"
</H1>
Oskar Lafontaine, the leader of the SPD, wants to revive the
"employment pact" between politicians, employers and unions. Mr. Lafontaine
said to the "Deutschlandfunk" radio station that the government had made a
serious mistake in not taking up the unions on their offer. He continued
that, should the SPD win the election next year, they would tackle the task
of forming such an alliance for employment as soon as possible. Mr.
Lafontaine also called for wage negotiators to agree to good salary
increases in order to increase German internal purchasing power.

Greens would like to introduce new social insurance
</H1>
The Alliance 90/Green party would like to replace the current
model of social insurance and unemployment benefits with new basic social
insurance legislation. According to Mr. Trittin, the Party's spokesman, the
high-ranking party committee made this resolution at their two-day meeting
in Magdeburg. The party is of the opinion that the basic benefit should be
800 marks per person, to which rent, medical and special care insurance
should be added. Mr. Trittin added that in the long term the social
insurance system should gradually be changed from a system based on
contributions to one financed by taxes.
