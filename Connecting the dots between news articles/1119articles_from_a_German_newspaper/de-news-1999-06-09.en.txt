Emergency regulations against dioxin-contaminated food
</H1>
Legal proceedings may be taken against the Belgian government on account
of the dioxin scandal. According to a spokesperson for the EU Commission
in Brussels, the country should have taken all suspected products off the
market, but this was apparently not done. Furthermore, Belgium violated
conditions imposed by the EU. The European Commission had instructed the
Belgium government to remove all food products from circulation which
contained ingredients suspected of being produced on dioxin-contaminated
farms. For the protection of consumers, the Ministry of Health in Bonn
issued appropriate emergency regulations today at noon. Department Head
Funke called the official information coming from Belgium "absurd".
Meanwhile in Baden-Wuerttemberg, a slightly increased level of dioxin was
detected in eggs from Belgium.

Criticism greets Social Democratic European manifesto
</H1>
The joint German/British manifesto regarding the future of Social
Democracy in Europe has encountered criticism from the left wing of the
SPD in Bonn. Von Larcher, a spokesperson for the "Frankfurt faction" of
the party, told the radio service "Deutschlandfunk" that the initiative
stands in conflict with the platform of the government. SPD
Secretary-General Schreiner, on the other hand, spoke of it as an
important impetus for modernization. The proposal evoked differing
reactions from the SPD's coalition partners, the Greens. The spokesperson
for the Green Party's executive council, Radcke, said she could see no
difference between the politics expressed in the manifesto and those of
the CDU. The Green Party budget specialist Metzger however called it an
important and courageous step forward.

Decision on financial aid for Ukrainian power plants delayed
</H1>
The federal cabinet in Bonn postponed a decision regarding financial aid
for two nuclear power plants in the Ukraine. The decision will be taken
next week at the earliest, pending parliamentary consultations. The SPD
and Greens have introduced a joint measure on this topic in the Bundestag.
According to the measure, Germany will only take part in the financing if
the Ukraine builds gas-fired power plants instead of nuclear ones. Behind
the controversy stands the alleged statement from Chancellor Schroeder
that he supports the project regardless. According to sources in Bonn,
despite his own misgivings, Schroeder feels bound by a 1995 treaty between
the G7 nations and the Ukraine.
