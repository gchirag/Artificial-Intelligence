Multiple car pile-up near Ulm
</H1>
There was a devastating multiple car pile-up this morning on the Autobahn
A8 Stuttgart - Muenchen between Merklingen and Ulm-West due to thick fog.
Three people were killed, and approximately fifty were injured (some of
them severely). According to the police, twelve mass accidents involving
a total of ninety vehicles occurred in both directions.
According to information thus far, a tourist bus drove into an automobile
ahead of it. Another bus then drove into the first bus. The collisions in
thick fog caused the first multiple car pile-up. An automobile caught fire.
The other multiple pile-ups occurred shortly thereafter. Another collision
occurred in the opposite lane that was probably caused by curious onlookers.
Witnesses at the scene reported that pieces of wreckage were strewn over
more than 500 meters. The Autobahn was closed in both directions. The fog
warning system in this section of the Autobahn has been turned off for
weeks for repairs. The regional Department for Street Maintenance in
Stuttgart had not counted on fog conditions already. According to initial
estimates by the police, damages will total approx. 1.5 million D-Marks.
Bundesfinanzminister Waigel offered his condolences to the victims of the
accident. Waigel wanted to fly from Stuttgart to Vienna for the EU meeting
of federal financial ministers; however, he was stuck in the kilometer-long
traffic jams that occurred after the accidents and had to cancel his
participation at the Vienna consultations.

Bundestag election campaign comes to an end
</H1>
At the end of the Bundestag election campaign, Federal Chancellor Kohl and
SPD challenger Schroeder have urgently challenged their supporters to fight
for every vote. Kohl said in Mainz that the election is a decision for
direction. In view of the many global crises, Germany has to continue to be
a dependable partner. Schroeder demanded that Kohl be voted out of office.
Schroeder called him the Chancellor of unemployment and couldn't achieve
social unification of the German Volk. Even the Buendnis 90/Greens, FDP and
PDS once again tried to get support for their party with rallys. 60.5
million German citizens are being urged to vote for a new Bundestag in tomorrow's
elections. A total of 33 parties with 5062 candidates are competing for Bundestag
seats. According to various surveys, many German citizens have not yet decided who
they should vote for tomorrow. Bundestag president Suessmuth warned citizens
that they should still vote - even if they are still unsure or frustrated.

Clashes during DVU rally
</H1>
There were clashes in Passau during a rally of the right-wing extremist
party DVU. Demonstrators tried to block DVU supporters from entering the

decision. They explained that they did not want to endanger any citizens in
view of the impending protests. However, police insiders stated that they
suspect that the right-wing extremist party could not raise the expected
500 participants.

Swissair buys into LTU
</H1>
According to the "Welt am Sonntag", the Swiss airline Swissair is taking
over 49.9% of the airline business of the German tour operator LTU. According to
the latest edition of the newspaper, the Swiss, who cannot acquire the majority
on the airline according to EU law, will take the leadership in the future. The
West German Landesbank, still the largest LTU shareholder with 34.3%,
retains almost 10%. They apparently still haven't agreed on a price. Those
knowledgeable in the industry are estimating the price at approximately two billion
marks. This corresponds to approximately the turnover of the last business year.
