Values of national currencies pegged against euro
</H1>
The leaders of the national central banks and the president of
the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, today decided upon the final
conversion rates of the national currencies against the euro. They took
part in a video-conference meeting to set the values of the eleven
countries joining the common currency. The national issuing banks
subsequently gave Brussels the last exchange rate of their individual
currencies against the American dollar. From that, the EU Commission
calculated the value of the ECU, a theoretical unit of currency used for
accounting purposes within the EU administration. Now, in accordance with
the EU Treaty, the euro will replace the ECU, at par. One euro corresponds
to DM 1.95583. In the early afternoon, economic and finance ministers
gathered to put their stamps on the newly established conversion rates.
They will come into effect with the official advent of the euro, at
midnight tonight.

A new era is dawning in Europe, as Austrian Finance Minister and President
of the EU Council, Rudolf Edlinger, said. He added that monetary union was
beginning at an ideal time, with low inflation and healthy finances.
German Economic Minister Werner Mueller said that the euro would be
stable, and would benefit the citizens of Germany and Europe, even though
coins and bills will not enter circulation for three years yet. Mueller
said that the euro had many fathers, but that former German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and his Finance Minister Theo Waigel deserved especial thanks.

Michaela Geiger dead
</H1>
CSU politician Michaela Geiger has died.. She sat in the Bundestag
as a representative for the CSU for 18 years. She died last night in a
clinic in Munich, following a long and difficult illness.
Geiger joined the CSU in 1971, and became the vice-president of the
regional CSU organization in Upper Bavaria (Oberbayern) in 1977. In 1980
the constituency of Franz-Josef Strauss elected Geiger, who was born in
Oberammergau, to the Bundestag. In 1991 she also became the Parliamentary
State Secretary in the Ministry for Economic Cooperation. In 1993 she
moved from there to the Federal Defence Ministry. In January 1997 she was
elected vice-president of the Bundestag, which position she held until the
government of Helmut Kohl was voted out last fall. Living in Riedsee near
Murnau, Geiger was very popular with the people of Upper Bavaria and
always fought for their interests. Bavaria's Premier Edmund Stoiber has
praised Michaela Geiger as always having fulfilled her duties with heart
and charm.

Court refuses Neue Maxhuette steelworks protection from creditors
</H1>
The District Court in Amberg has rejected an application from
the Neue Maxhuette steelworks for protection from its creditors, and has
begun bankruptcy proceedings. The company, which is now threatened with
closure, employs 1500 people. The trustee in this case is Heidelberg
jurist Jobst Wellensieg. He must determine, in the coming weeks  or
months, whether the steelworks can be rehabilitated, or if a new investor
needs to be sought. Juergen Grossmann of the Georgsmarienhuette steelworks
near Osnabrueck is currently involved in talks as a potential new
investor. The take-over talks have not been completed, the purchase price
not yet negotiated, as the trustee said, but an agreement is within sight.
Wellensieg said the negotiations were very hard, but he was optimistic,
even regarding the future of the 1500 jobs at the works.

embassy in San'a today, and have already been able to telephone their
families. The question of when the three women and one man would return
home is expected to be answered in the course of the day.

Demands for reorganization of federal states
</H1>
The Bavarian state government has confirmed its demand for
a reorganization of the states in Germany. The director of the State
Chancellery, Erwin Huber, said in a conversation with the ap news agency
that he considered 16 states to be too many; fusing some together would
therefore be necessary. The mayor of Berlin, Eberhard Diepgen (CDU), also
came out in favour of territorial reform within the federation. He said
that the dispute over equalization payments between the states may in fact
only be solvable if the creation of new, more equitably performing units
were considered. He suggested the year 2009 as a possible date for a
decision.
