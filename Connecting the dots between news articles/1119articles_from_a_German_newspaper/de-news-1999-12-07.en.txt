News from SPD party congress
</H1>
The SPD federal party congress has been opened today in the
capital. Five hundred fifty-two delegates will elect a new executive
board and president by Thursday. The Social-Democrats also want to
adopt a new course in economics and tax politics. Deputy party
president and Bundestag president Wolfgang Thierse referred in his
opening speech to the CDU donation affaire saying that, today, people
were wondering more than ever whether they could trust in politics.
Chancellor Schroeder was even more pointed. In his opening speech the
Chancellor also defended his support for the shaky Holzmann group.
Politics must always act when a large company falls into a crisis by
mismanagement. Another topic of his speech was the Alliance for
Employment. The Chancellor expects concrete results for the Alliance at
its next meeting. In the afternoon, the party had adopted a motion to
create this office. Franz Muentefering was elected first
secretary-general of the party at the congress with 94.2 percent of the
votes. Chancellor Schroeder was re-elected as eighth president in the
SPD's history with surprisingly high 86.3 percent of the votes. Four of
his deputies were re-elected: Bundestag President Wolfgang Thierse,
Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Bavaria's SPD president
Renate Schmidt and Defence Minister Rudolf Scharping. Wolfgang Clement
was elected fifth deputy.

The costs for a home office remain only partially tax
deductible. This was found by the Federal Constitutional Court. The
constitutional challenge of a secondary-school teacher from Schleswig
Holstein was rejected. The teacher had challenged the 1996 tax law that
stipulates that costs for some offices are only tax-deductible when the
room is the centre of the professional activity. Else, only 2400 DM can
be claimed.
