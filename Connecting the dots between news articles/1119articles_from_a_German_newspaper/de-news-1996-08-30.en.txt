Unions stop talking to government about unemployment
</H1>
There are not to be new talks about how to fight unemployment between
the German Federation of Unions and government, according to Mr Schulte, of
the federation. He said that government had weaselled out of this dialogue
in order to push the high-wage earner's and employers' barrow. Talks about a
compact for work, however, were not generally off, according to Mr Schulte.

German economy back in gear
</H1>
Mr Rexrodt, Federal Minister of Economics, thinks that the German
economy has got back into gear again, quoting about .75% growth for this
year. Next year, however, this could rise to 2 or 2.5%. Labour markets would
stay depressed, though. This year he was expecting some 320,000 more persons
to become unemployed.
Referring to the dispute between the EU and VW about subsidies, he said that
his government would try and go for a compromise that would also take into
account the European Union's concerns.

Preparations for re-patriation of Bosnian refugees
</H1>
Lower Saxony's and Bavaria's ministers for internal affairs have travelled to
Bosnia to find out about the situation at the pit-face and what returning
refugees would be facing there. And they also want to determine, if some
320,000 refugees currently in Germany would be able to return from 1
October, as planned. North-Rhine/Westphalia's minister, however, pointed out
that  some conditions for the refugees' return had not been met yet, for
example the cancellation of local elections in Bosnia proving that there was
not enough stability there. Bavaria's minister said, after he had arrived at
Sarajevo, that this visit would not be the sole base for assessing
re-patriation.

President of the Bundesbank on tax-reform
</H1>
Mr Tietmayer, of the Bundesbank, thinks the discussion about
raising sales tax (VAT) is not right. He thinks reforming tax is okay, but
the emphasis of the discussion should not be on more tax. The general idea
is less tax, and that is why there should not be any discussion about
raising sales tax at this stage.

Public health insurers in dire financial straits
</H1>
The financial situation of the public health insurers has deteriorated even
further. Mr Kaula, of the insurers' association, told the HANNOVERSCHEN
ALLGEMEINEN ZEITUNG, that things were so bad that he would not rule out that
some insurers would be unable to meet their commitments. The half-private
Ersatzkassen, however, were not prepared to take out loans for operating
costs. Once any surplus was used up, people would have to think about models
where suppliers of health-care would not get more than partial payments.

Mr Markus Wolf taken to court once again
</H1>
The federal prosecutor has taken Markus Wolf to court once again.
Mr Wolf was head of the former East German intelligence service. He is
accused of causing injury plus unlawful detainment. The lawsuit is to be

Court. In 1962, Mr Wolf allegedly took part in a commando high-jacking and
returning an intelligence officer (who had fled) to East Germany. The man
and his girl-friend allegedly had been lured into a trap in Austria, and
then shipped to East Germany, where they subsequently spent several years
in jail.
