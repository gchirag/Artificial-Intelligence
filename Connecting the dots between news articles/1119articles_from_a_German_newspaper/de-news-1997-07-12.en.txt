Mr. Scharping calls for government accommodation in tax quarrel
</H1>
The head of the SPD parliamentary faction, Mr. Scharping, has
demanded accommodation on the part of the government to settle the
quarrel concerning the planned tax reform.  Mr. Scharping told
DEUTSCHLANDFUNK, if the Coalition continued with its chaotic,
frivolous financial policy, it could not count on support from the
opposition.  At the same time, he rejected charges that his party
was exercising blockade tactics in the Bundesrat [the upper house
of the German parliament].  Rather, he continued, good suggestions
made by Social Democrats were permanently rejected.  In its
compromise procedures, the SPD was aiming for results which would
start economic upswing again and would take the burden off
businesses.  For this reason, lowering fringe benefits and
abolishing the industrial capital tax would be essential.

expressed his warning against the SPD majority's renewing
its blockade of the planned tax reform.  Mr Schaeuble told the WDR
[West German Radio] that it made no sense to begin initiatives of
which one knew that the SPD-head, Mr. Lafontaine would prevent
their passage with a "scorched earth policy." Mr. Schaeuble
emphasized that the reform package passed by the Coalition
government was needed to lower unemployment in Germany.

Congress of Silesian compatriots has begun in Nuernberg
</H1>
At the beginning of the German congress of Silesians in Nuernberg,
the Bavarian minister for social matters, Ms. Stamm, emphasized the
major progress made in relations with Poland.  Thus, the new Polish
constitution was ensuring minority rights to a large extent.  In
the meantime, a German-Polish group of historians was currently
investigating flight and expulsion from the eastern territories of
the former German Reich, she stated.  The federal head of the
compatriots, Mr. Rupka (sp?), pointed out that there were still
approximately 800 000 Germans living in Upper Silesia today.   Mr.
Rupka called for their situation to be improved.  The federal
government and the federal parliament had a duty to look after the
Silesians, he stated.  Approximately 100 000 participants are
expected at the two-day congress of Silesian compatriots.

One million participate in love parade in Berlin
</H1>
It is estimated that ca. one million persons celebrated at the love
parade in Berlin.  The Berlin celebration with techno-music and
dancing is considered the largest party of the year in the world.
The music fans, most of them young people, paraded from Ernst-
Reuter-Platz through the Tiergarten to the Brandenburg Gate.  This
year, the motto of the love parade is "let the sunshine into your
heart."  Because of resistance, 40 punkers, who consider the
spectacle too commercial, were taken into custody by the police.
The city trains and subways in Berlin were overcrowded.  The flow
of traffic temporarily collapsed in one area as it also did in many
city streets and on the surrounding Autobahnen .
