Compromise reached in dispute over coal subsidies
</H1>
A compromise has been reached in the dispute over proposed cuts in
subsidies to the coal industry. Under the agreement there should be no
compulsory lay-offs.
The financial assistance provided by the Federal Government and the states
is to be reduced from approximately 9 billion DM to 5.5 billion by the
year 2005. This will result in the gradual elimination of about 48,000 of
the current 85,000 jobs in the mining industry. Once the agreement between
Chancellor Kohl and the head of the Union of Mineworkers, Mr. Berger, had
been announced, the miners ended their protest action.  The coalition
government, the opposition parties and the German Federation of Trade
Unions all expressed their satisfaction with the compromise.
Approximately 8,000 miners from the Saarland region of Germany spent last
night in Cologne, eagerly awaiting the outcome of the coal summit.  The
miners camped out in tents or slept on the floor of local sports halls.
Mr. Kohl had indicated yesterday evening, that there was every hope of a
compromise.

Despite compromise, pit closures still planned
</H1>
Following the compromise over coal subsidies, Ruhrkohle AG (the company
responsible for mines in the Ruhr region) has announced that it will
decide by the Autumn, which four collieries should close by the year 2000.
The most likely candidates for closure are one mine in the Saarland, and
three in the Ruhr region, announced the managing director of Ruhrkohle AG,
Mr. Neib. The necessary job cuts are to be achieved through the
introduction of part-time work, retraining and early retirement, but
without compulsory lay-offs. According to Mr. Neib, the take-over of the
government-owned sector of the Saar mines by Ruhrkohle could be considered
effective from January of this year. The merger was one of the
pre-conditions for increased funding from the Federal Government.

Private health insurers want to raise premiums
</H1>
The major private health insurers want to increase premiums. DAK, BEK, TKK
and seven other health insurance companies today submitted applications to
this effect at the Federal Insurance Agency in Berlin. Increases of less
than one percent are planned. As the applications have been submitted
before the qualifying date for legal reforms, the increase in premiums
will not automatically result in higher deductibles.  In Bonn the Minister
for Health, Mr. Seehofer, spoke of a manoeuvre by the insurance companies
designed to put pressure on the current discussions about health reforms.
He said he would refuse to give in to such pressure.

tax by a large majority. Up until now the tax has been calculated on the

legislation the level of tax will depend on the quantity of harmful
substances contained in an automobile's exhaust fumes. Tomorrow the
Bundesrat must agree to the compromise put forward by the arbitration
committee.

Collective bargaining talks in construction industry postponed
</H1>
The collective bargaining talks for the 1.3 million employees in the
construction industry were postponed this evening in Frankfurt.  The union
leader, Mr. Wiesehuegel, explained that the discussions had generated
little basis for an agreement. Only a common interest in a new regulation
for bad-weather-payments prevented the breakdown of the talks. The two
parties plan to meet again on March 25th.

which would be less of a financial burden for companies. Under the
proposal, employees aged 55 would have the option of working for a further
10 years part-time.

Borussia Dortmund celebrated a 3:0 victory over Hansa Rostock, despite a
poor performance.
