Mr Seehofer critical of ban on tobacco-advertising
</H1>
Federal Health Minister Seehofer criticised the EU-decision on banning
tobacco-advertising as over the top and contentious. Federal government had
fundamental and legal doubts on the issue, according to Mr Seehofer. And it
was moot if the EU was competent to decide on such bans for their
member-states. German publishers of newspapers and magazines thought this
was a severe encroachment on the liberty of the press. The UFA movie
advertising company said that without tobacco-advertising some 1000 cinemas
would go to the wall.

<P>
European tobacco-advertisers also were critical, whereas the German Cancer
Foundation and the German Medical Association were both quite in favour. The
German Council Against Addictions thought that the decision was right, and
sent the right signals. Smoking was the number-one factor causing illness
and premature death, and it was totally avoidable. In Germany every year at
least 100,000 people, who had smoked for years, die of related illnesses.

<P>
German tobacco manufacturers think the decision would be against Germany's
constitution, as it was encroaching on the freedom of the press. Federal
Germany's government should not take that lying down.

FDP wants to trim compulsory public pension scheme
</H1>
Coalition partner FDP wants to trim the compulsory public pension scheme
and introduce a compulsory private system, according to the head of the
party Gerhardt. Less money should be paid in and out of the public system
during the next generation, lowering contributions as well as pensions. The
monies saved should be invested in private schemes. The coalition's model
where pensions would drop from 70% to 64% of base-rates, in stages, would not
be enough to fix the problems caused by a declining birth-rate.

Former East Germany's dole-queues getting longer and longer
</H1>
Federal Economics Minister Rexrodt admitted that in spite of all efforts to
the contrary, redundancies in former East Germany had not come to a stop.
The goal to stabilise the work-force at 6.4 million, as in 1996, had not
been reached, according to the minister who spoke at the first East German
Economic Conference in Potsdam. He was also uncertain if the 1998 average
would mean more employment for former East Germany, but he thought that
at the end of next year the dole-queue would shrink by some 100,000.

Number of students drawing education-benefits/loans down significantly
</H1>
The number of student beneficiaries has dropped significantly, so
much so that, according to a report by the federal government, barely 25% of
students are entitled now - compared to 34% six years ago. The report also
stated that benefits would not cover essentials any more. A student required
about 1220 marks/month in West Germany, and that would also cover rent,
clothes and books, whereas the maximum benefit was 995 marks/month.
