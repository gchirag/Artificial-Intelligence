Breakthrough in Alliance for Work
</H1>
After months of rancour over the possible pensioning of 60-year-olds, the
federal government, employers, and unions have taken a large step forward.
They have agreed upon a compromise in early retirement. A visibly pleased
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said after the meeting that it was now up to
the employers and unions to hammer out the details.
A second breakthrough was an agreement to pursue job-creation-oriented and
longer(er)-term wage policies. This will prevent the coming rounds of
industry contract negotiations from becoming exclusively about more money,
as they were threatened to if the Alliance for Work failed.
The president of the employers' association, Dieter Hundt, also welcomed the
agreement.
Criticism was forthcoming, however, from the Central Association of German
Trades, which said that the interests of small and medium contractors were
ignored.

Paul Spiegel new president of Central Jewish Council
</H1>
Paul Spiegel, a businessman from Duesseldorf, has been elected the new
president of the German Central Jewish Council. The 62-year-old artists'
agent received six of nine votes. He announced that he would take an active
role in German politics, and would continue the work of his predecessor,
Ignatz Bubis. "One of our primary problems is the work of integration. Our
community has almost tripled in the last few years. And we want to help the
Jewish congregations to achieve this integration", he said.
The Central Jewish Council has represented Jews in Germany since 1950.

Flu outbreak in Europe
</H1>
Europe is in the grip of an influenza virus. Germany and Italy have been
added to the sick list. Worst hit, however, is Great Britain. The situation
there has now been officially labelled an epidemic. Infection rates are
still below those of last year, but the chief medical officer of the British
government, Liam Donaldson, is calling the situation extremely serious. He
said the numbers are in fact much higher than reported, and the peak of
infection has not yet nearly been reached. He said that 3-4,000 people die
of the flu every year in Britain - in large part because the health system
itself has been ailing for years. He said that the number of intensive-care
beds still empty across the country can be counted on one hand.
