DIHT criticizes SPD/Green Party electoral platforms
</H1>
The DIHT [ Council of German Chambers of Commerce] has criticized the
electoral platforms of B90/Green Party and SPD.
Chairman Stihl, presenting the Council's list of what is expected from
the political sector in the election year in Bonn, said the DHIT did not
consider the Greens apt for government.
In view of the SPD's rigid attitude in the matter of upper tax limits,
disagreements with their line have also increased.
The political expectations of the DIHT, Stihl said, are most closely
reflected by the FDP's platform; minor disagreements with the CDU and
CSU persist. The DIHT's political shopping list includes a tax reform
bill and additional efforts towards a balanced federal budget. Stihl
reaffirmed the council's stand against plans of the CDU to increase
energy taxes. This kind of action only aims at increasing the national
revenue.

Yeltsin compelled to sign "Sequestered Art" bill
</H1>
Russian president Yeltsin suffered a grave defeat before the
constitutional court. In a basic decision, the court today ordered the
president to sign the law immediately. The law declares cultural assets
seized in Germany and transferred to the Soviet Union during World War
II to be Russian property.
The reasoning on which the decision was based said that by opposing the
law, Yeltsin had overstepped his competence.
It was not his decision, whether the parliamentary procedure was
constitutionally correct or not. The house of representatives and the
federation's council had overridden the president's veto by a 2/3
majority about one year ago.
Yeltsin's spokesman meanwhile announced that the president would comply
with the court order, but would also go to court against both the gist
of the law and the parliamentary procedure.

Union to seek common platform in spite of energy tax divergence
</H1>
In spite of their differences on the energy tax question, the two Union
parties aim to go into the electoral fight with a common platform. CDU
secretary general Hintze and his counterpart Protzner agreed to
collaborate on a consensus paper. Still, CSU will insist on clear-cut
corrections to their sister party's project. Protzner renewed his
criticism of CDU's plans to increase taxes on energy usage. Hintze
declared in Bonn that the CDU sticks to the joint decision by both
parties, to go for a European Union-wide energy  tax. The SPD's
candidate for the chancellorship Schroeder said ecologically motivated
taxes must not endanger the German economy's competitiveness.

Trade unions agree to SPD platform in principle
</H1>
The trade unions basically agreed with SPD's platform on measures
against unemployment. DGB vice-chairwoman Engelen-Kefer announced that
after a meeting of the social democrats' trade union committee in Bonn.
According to Ms. Engelen-Kefer, the trade unions can accept the basic
aspects of the platform notwithstanding the fact that some of its items
would have to be turned into fact in case of an SPD victory. Earlier,
the SPD council had approved the tax plans of the social democrats.
Council chairman Fikentscher said there was a consensus on the reduction
of the upper tax rate limit to 49% (now 53%), that is part of the
platform. He said the delegates were also in favor of a codicil allowing
further reduction, if there is a financial margin.
