Trittin rejects rumors concerning marked increases in gasoline prices
</H1>
For the first time, Federal Minister for the Environment, Trittin, had
good news for Germany's drivers. There is no doubt that the tax on gasoline will increase by 6 Pfennig per liter as planned. He rejected demands
from within his own party for a higher increase in gasoline prices. However, details concerning the planned eco-tax are relatively unclear. The
production industries could face a reduction in energy tax of roughly 20%;
companies with high energy needs are to be exempted from this tax in order
to remain competitive.
The attained surplus is to be used to reduce social security contributions
by 0.8% to 19.5% beginning in 1999.

New job creation model in Lower-Saxony
</H1>
The social partners of the metal industry in Lower-Saxony intend to fight
unemployment with a new job creation model. A spokesperson of IG Metall
said in Hanover that it is the goal to create new jobs through voluntary
reduction of work hours. The union and the regional association of
industries created an association for promoting employment for this
purpose. Beginning next year, this association is supposed to make up most
of the difference in reduced income for those employees who volunteer to
work less. Initially, employers will set aside 10 million German marks
for this program. The union, on the other hand, will give up a number of
its tariff demands.

talks on a pension at age 60 without financial losses are possible as
early as next year. In an interview with "Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung,"
the DGB vice-chairman, Engelen-Kieer, estimated the number of potential
beneficiaries to be 2.9 million. This could lead to a relief of the job
market. However, minister Engelen-Kiefer said that pension at age 60 is
to be taken on a voluntary basis.
