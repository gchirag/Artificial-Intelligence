Scientologists will not be readmitted into CDU
</H1>
The seventh civil division of the Regional Court in Bonn has rejected
the complaint of 3 scientology members against the CDU. The 3 former
CDU-members were booted out of the party by the CDU's federal party court.
The reason given for that expulsion was that scientology's power structure
and treatment of critics cannot be reconciled with the basic philosophies
of the party. Scientology has already announced that, following an
examination of the regional court's ruling, it will pursue further legal
channels.

Mood in Eastern Germany increasingly irritated
</H1>
The spokesman for Eastern German SPD members of the Bundestag,
Schwanitz (sp?) has described the mood in the east of the country as
increasingly irritated. On SWF radio he pointed out that more and more
people in the East are threatened by unemployment all the time, and that
gets to people. Schwanitz said that Eastern Germans would like to make
their fair contribution to rebuilding, but are unable to because there are
not enough jobs.

Fewer jobs in heavy industry in the future
</H1>
The president of the Frauenhofer Society, Warneke (sp?), expects
a serious decrease in positions in heavy industry. Warneke told economic
reporters last night that it would not be much longer before only 20
percent of the work force, rather than the current 40 percent, is needed to
secure the material needs of the society. He said that the vast majority of
jobs in the future would be in the service branch, although it was not
clear how society would cope with the change-over. Warneke added that in
the past, government and society had hindered innovation rather than helped
it; however, research and development are the primary engine of economic
growth.

Supreme Court confirms judgement against Schalck
</H1>
The one-year probationary sentence against former East German
foreign exchange procurist Schalck-Golodkowski is valid, the Federal
Supreme Court has ruled. Judges threw out Schalck's appeal of the sentence
imposed by the Regional Court in Berlin in January 1996. Schalck was
convicted of violating a law of the military government in 1949, when he
acquired military equipment from West Germany for the East German People's
Army. His lawyers are now considering taking the case to the Federal
Constitutional Court.

Fraud and betrayal cost German companies billions

German companies lose billions of Marks every year to fraud,
embezzlement, and betrayal. The Hermes Credit Insurance company expects the
damages this year to total about DM 10 billion. Credit insurers feel that
company reorganizations as well as electronic data management make it
easier for sticky-fingered employees to rip off the companies they work for.

Kohl happy with NATO summit
</H1>
Madrid, Spain. Federal Chancellor Kohl has expressed satisfaction with the
outcome of the NATO summit in Madrid. Kohl said that the approval of
memberships for Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary was a step toward
more security in Europe. The signing of a basic agreement between NATO and
Russia in Paris recently, the signing of a charter between NATO and Ukraine
today, and the opening up of NATO to the realities of the near and
immediate future represent a new era in European security, according to the
Chancellor. Kohl also said that the membership negotiations with the 3
candidates must begin as soon as possible; he fully expects that Poland,
the Czech Republic, and Hungary will be able to sit down at the alliance's
conference table in time for NATO's 50th anniversary in April 1999. This
will not be the last expansion of the organization, Kohl continued; the
rejected candidacies of Romania and Slovenia especially must be given a
second chance, and a partnership for peace must be advanced for all those
still outside of the alliance. Kohl concluded that, in any case, no new
graves must be opened in Europe.
