Economic growth of 2.4 percent expected
</H1>
The German Institute for Economics Research predicts that the economic
growth will be 2.4 percent this year. However, they also expect that
the number of unemployed in December last year has passed the
four-million mark again. Although this does not look rosy at first
view, the experts are relieved. The number of unemployed people may
have risen by 150'000 to 200'000 but this would be less than the
quarter million recorded the previous year. A positive sign, the
experts purportedly agree. The lower numbers are probably due to a mild
December weather and economic growth that is slowly gaining speed.

Still confusion about million-mark-transfer of CDU
</H1>
Information about the transfer of millions of marks from the CDU
parliamentary faction and the party are still quite confusing. It is
clear that the CDU Bundestag faction has given about 1.15 million marks
to the party - in cash. It is not clear where the money comes from.
Today, Joachim Hoerster, executive officer of the parliamentary
faction, was unable to explain the origin in detail. He considered the
million-mark transfer from faction to party unusual but not
inexplicable and in no way illegal. The money that was handed over in a
suitcase belonged to the party. Since an account number could not be
used, the money was paid cash. Beyond that, he was not concerned with
where the money ended up. At any rate, faction leader Wolfgang
Schaeuble was not informed about the details, said Hoerster. Gunda
Roestel, spokeswoman for the Buendnis90/Gruene executive, called again
on the CDU to resolve the confusion quickly. After all, lawyer
Schaeuble must know that the parliamentary faction of a large
mainstream party is neither the Olsen gang [a comic, hapless Danish
gang from a series of movies] nor a bowling club.

Constitutional challenge against eco-tax?
</H1>
CDU law expert Scholl (sp?) thinks there are good chances to win a
constitutional challenge against the eco-tax because the tax is
violating the constitutionally guaranteed equality. The Federal
Association Goods Transport, Logistics, and Waste Management has
announced today that five companies standing in for the association
will challenge the law before the Federal Constitutional Court in
spring.
