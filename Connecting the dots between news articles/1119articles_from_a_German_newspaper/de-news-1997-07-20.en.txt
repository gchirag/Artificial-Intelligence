Water levels at the Oder have stabilized
</H1>
The water levels at the River Oder on the German-Polish border have
stabilized. According to Brandenburg's Ministry for Internal Affairs, the
water levels in the area of Oberlauf (near Ratzdorf) in fact decreased
slightly to 6.52 meters during the night. The water level in Frankfurt
Oder was 6.10 meters in the afternoon [Sunday], which is only two
centimeters more than the previous night's measurement. This data from
the Ministry of Internal Affairs amended information from earlier in the
day where it was reported that the water level in Frankfurt Oder had
fallen. The authorities are still worried that the drenched dikes could
break. Ministry spokesmen in Potsdam said today that this was a greater
threat than the increased water level itself. Numerous leaks have already
had to be stopped up with sand bags. A second wave of floods is expected
after the heavy rains in the last few days. It is difficult to make
forecasts in this regard, however, as reports on Polish water levels have
been irregular.

<P>
Furthermore, many rivers in Bavaria have broken their banks. It is
expected that roads will be flooded in the area of Passau due to the high
water levels of the Inn and Danube rivers.

Wreath-laying ceremony in commemoration of Hitler assassination attempt
</H1>
A special wreath-laying ceremony in memory of members of the
resistance group who took part in the failed assassination attempt on
Hitler on July 20, 53 years ago, was held in Berlin today. The Federal
Minister of Justice, Mr. Schmidt-Jortzig, laid a wreath at Ploetzensee
where many of the members of the resistance group led by Klaus Graf
Schenk von Staufenberg were executed. In their speeches, both Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and Mrs. Rita Suessmuth, president of the Bundestag (lower
house of parliament) honored the resistance fighters, calling them
pioneers of democracy in Germany. Mr. Beck, the spokesman for legal and
political matters for the Green Party, spoke about discrimination against
communist resistance fighters. He said it was time that homage be paid to

Criticism of Germany's high EU membership dues
</H1>
Criticism is growing in Germany on Germany's membership dues for the
European Union, which some regard as too high. In an interview with the
Sunday newspaper "Welt am Sonntag", Klaus Kinkel, Germany's Foreign
Minister, spoke of the over proportional burden on Germany. He said that
EU payments should be revised with the goal being that costs be divided
up more justly between the members of the EU.  According to the
newspaper, a paper issued by EU Ministers of Finance stated that
Germany's contributions to the EU were of such a magnitude that it was
the equivalent of a special tax. Germany currently pays around 25 billion
marks; this is more than double the amount paid by France and Great
Britain together. In an article published in the newspaper "Welt am
Sonntag" Edmund Stoiber, the state premier of Bavaria, has called for a new
financial ratio; the goal being that German contributions should be
approximately halved to about 12 billion marks.

Jagoda: halving of unemployment rate is possible
</H1>
The president of the Federal Labor Office is of the opinion
that it is possible to halve the rate of unemployment by the year 2002.
This is not just a Fata Morgana of Chancellor Kohl, Mr. Jagoda said in
an interview. According to calculations carried out by his organization,
two million new jobs could be created in the next five years. A
prerequisite for this would be to reduce the amount of overtime worked by
40 percent, to create more part-time jobs, to reduce secondary wage costs
by 2 percent and to keep salary increases down to the level of inflation,
Mr. Jagoda said.

Muentefering: FDP could be acceptable as coalition partners
</H1>
Mr. Muentefering, Federal Secretary General of the Social Democratic
Party (SPD), does not exclude the possibility of forming a coalition with
the Free Democratic Party (FDP) after the general election in Autumn
1998. He did admit that under the present circumstances, this was
difficult to picture. However, he considers the FDP to be flexible enough
to change sides in order to remain in power. The SPD only intends to make
an announcement regarding coalition partners at their federal party
conference in April, at the earliest. Mr. Muentefering also said that a
coalition between the SPD and the Green Party was more likely than one
with the FDP.

</H1>
Schoenau am Koenigssee. 16 researchers had been missing in the Salzgraben
caves since Friday 16 in the alpine region of Berchtesgaden. The

the group's way out. Divers were able to provide the 14 teachers and two
guides with a vacuum tent in which they were rescued through a flooded
passage. According to the Bavarian border police, none of the rescued
sustained any injuries.
