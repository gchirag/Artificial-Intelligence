cannot extend indefinitely. The UN office for refugees argues on behalf

looking glass yearly, according to income level. This will occur after
the first of January, after a nation-wide random sample is selected, the
story reports. With these methods the risk for tax dodgers should be
incalculable.

The role of the BND in high tech smuggling is more unclear
</H1>
The role of the Federal Reports Service (BND) in the recently discovered
smuggling of German computers for a Libyan poison gas plant is as unclear
as ever. Balanian, the apparent mastermind of the smuggling, has
testified to the complicity of the BND.
The news magazine Focus is said to have discovered from Belgian
informants that Balanian, a fugitive with international arrest warrents
against him, wants to return to Belgium at the end of September.
Apparently the Libyan, who has a Gemran passport, wants to present
documentation in which the Pullach managementis implicated in the poison
gas case. The BND has already admitted to maintaining contact with
Balanian since 1992, however maintains ignorance of the illegal shipment.
The parliamentary investigating commision, which addressed the case this
week, also has uncovered no trace yet of an entanglement on the part of
the BND. In teh session, the head of the service Geiger is said by Focus
to have explained that Balanian had received no material gain in his
meeting with the agents of the service. Balanian, along with two managers
from Moenchengladbach already in custody, is said to have delivered
computers capable of use in poison gas production to Libya.

Will telephoning soon be less expensive?
</H1>
Using the telephone may soon become less expensive for Germans. Post
Master Boetsch has requested a rate reduction, accroding to the magazine
Focus. It reports that Telekom is to lower its total pricing structure
six percent as of January 1 1998. Two years later an equal rate
adjustment is to occur. Focus attributes this to a letter from Boetsch to
Telekom. A spokesman for the firm confirmed to B5-aktuell the existence
of such a letter. "We received a letter from Mr. Boetsch, that much is
accurate. We are presently testing the effects of these suggestions on
the company. We will analyse these and state our opinions on it." The
spokesman for Telekom did not want to comment on the exact contents of
the letter. Price reductions seem certain, it is their magnitude which is
still the open question.
