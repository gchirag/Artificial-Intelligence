Reports on sales tax increase denied
</H1>
Newspaper reports that an increase in sales tax from January 2000 is
planned have caused a stir in Bonn today. The Federal Ministry of Finance
immediately denied the report in the "Bild am Sonntag" newspaper that
sales tax would be increased from 16to 17 or even 18 percent. The
newspaper said that the official reason given for this increase would be
that it was to bring German sales tax in line with sales tax in other EU
countries, however the real reason would be to find extra money to stop
up budget deficits. A spokesman for the ministry said that the newspaper
report was pure fiction and totally absurd. The government itself has
also strongly denied the report according to Ms Reinhardt, government
spokesman. Angela Merkel, General Secretary for the CDU has, in the
meanwhile, challenged Oskar Lafontaine to personally respond to the
allegations.

Stoiber supports retaining nuclear reactors
</H1>
Edmund Stoiber, State Premier of Bavaria, has joined the discussion on
the future of atomic energy in Germany and says that he strongly supports
sticking to the current federal laws on nuclear reactors. Mr. Stoiber
said to the news magazine "Focus" that "if other German states want to
close down nuclear reactors it is their business. However, we in Bavaria
will continue to use atomic energy along with France and England".

<P>
Juergen Trittin, Federal Minister of the Environment, has been defended
by his parliamentary group. He had proposed that atomic energy be taxed
by one pfennig per kilowatt hour. This new tax is supposed to compensate
for injustices in the system. According to the Greens, in the past gas
and oil had been taxed, however nuclear energy and coal was not. They
said that the price advantages arising from this situation were neither
ecological or ecologically justifiable.
