Reduction of Solidarity Supplement still uncertain
</H1>
Despite an agreement within the Coalition, it remains uncertain
whether a 2 percent reduction to the Solidarity Supplement will come to
pass. Of a DM 7.5 billion shortfall in federal revenues, only DM 700
million has been covered so far. Government sources bringing forward these
figures thus contradicted reports that the reduction was now sure to go
into effect on January 1, 1998. CDU/CSU and FDP came to an agreement in
principle on Monday evening to lower the rate from 7.5 percent to 5.5
percent, but only on the condition that the loss of tax revenue be limited
to DM 700 million. Federal Finance Minister Waigel only has that much
leeway in the 1998 budget.

Unemployment rate rises again
</H1>
Due to seasonal fluctuations, the number of unemployed is up.
Employment offices registered an increase of 132,000 unemployed over last
month, for a total of more than 4.3 million. According to the Federal
Labour Office, the rate has climbed from 11 percent to 11.4 percent in the
last month. The Office attributes the change primarily to the summer
break, in the West; in the East, the situation is generally much worse.
Taking seasonal adjustments into account, there are 17,000 more unemployed
around Germany than last month. Since last winter saw systemic
unemployment increase significantly too, there are 443,000 more unemployed
today than 12 months ago.

Union blames government for high unemployment
</H1>
The German Federation of Unions is laying most of the blame for the
miserable employment situation at the feet of the federal government. The
Federation says Bonn is helpless and clueless as unemployment and stocks
both set new records at the same time. It says that rather than creating
jobs, things are being dismantled, and points at the latest cuts in
training and job-creation programs. The situation is supposed to be
especially dramatic among young people, who often cannot find a job after
completing their apprenticeship, and who constitute an increasing portion
of the ranks of the unemployed. The SPD is calling for a quick drop in
secondary wage costs, as a means of putting more money in people's pockets
and so stimulating the economy and creating new jobs.

has demanded that the federal government implement immediate action to
relieve the economy. The action should include a substantial cut to
personnel taxes and to the highest tax bracket for commercial incomes.

the 1998 Bundestag election.

Trial dealing with East German sentences begins in Berlin
</H1>
The Regional Court in Berlin is re-examining the last death
sentence carried out in former East Germany. Two former military judges
and a former military prosecutor are thought to have unjustly sentenced 2
officers of the East German State Security Service (Stasi) to death for
spying for West Germany. The 2 officers, independently, wanted to take up
residence in West Germany and had gathered secret material, but their
escapes failed. The Public Prosecutor's Office in Berlin has taken the
position that the sentences hung upon the officers were determined by the
Stasi and the Military Prosecution, and approved by then-East German
leader Erich Honecker, in the full knowledge that the death penalty in
such cases was a serious offence against human rights.

Flood situation continues to improve slowly
</H1>
Frankfurt on the Oder. The catastrophe alarm in the flood area south of
Frankfurt on the Oder is to be cancelled tomorrow, the president of the
Environment Ministry of Brandenburg, Freude, announced. It is not yet
clear, however, when the residents of the towns in the Oderbruch valley
will be able to return to their homes. The situation concerning the dikes
in that area is still critical. Overall, the water level is falling at a
rate of about 1 centimetre an hour. Despite serious warnings from Internal
Affairs in Potsdam, the first residents are returning to their homes in
towns affected by the flood. In order to help residents clean up, the army
will remain in the area. Defence Minister Ruehe said that they will help
make the dikes secure for the winter, as well. The federal government has
assured the victims of DM 500 million in aid. Meanwhile, thousands of
unemployed people have volunteered for duty in the disaster area.

More than 82 million people in Germany
</H1>
For the first time, there are more than 82 million people
living in Germany. According to the Federal Statistics Office, the
population in 1996 was up slightly, at 0.2 percent over the previous year.
The increase is due entirely to immigration by foreigners and ethnic
Germans from abroad, as the death rate in Germany has been higher than the
birth rate for years. Nevertheless, almost 100,000 fewer foreigners moved
to Germany in 1996 than in 1995.

Allianz Insurance expects to pay out DM 100 million for flood damage
</H1>
The Allianz Insurance Company calculates that it will have to pay
its policy holders DM 100 million for damages due to the flooding of the
Oder River. The Allianz subsidiary, the German Insurance Company, is the
only West German insurance company to have taken over the commitments of
the former East German state insurance. That is the only place that
insures against such catastrophes as a flood. Almost all of the thousands
of victims of the Oder flood are insured through Allianz.

Lower Saxony must pay damages to federal administration for Gorleben
</H1>
Lower Saxony must pay the state for damages due to a halt of
construction at the planned Gorleben nuclear waste facility. At the end of
1990, work on Shaft 2 at the planned storage facility was stopped for 5
months because neighbours had registered opposition to the plans. The
state of Lower Saxony permitted the stop, whereas the federal
administration feels that an order of execution could have forced a
resumption of construction. Lower Saxony has now effectively lost the
legal battle; all that remains is to determine the cost of the damages.
The federal administration is demanding DM 10 million.

The Public Prosecutor's Office, in conjunction with preliminary
proceedings across the country, has searched 63 offices and construction
sites of various companies. About DM 1.5 million was secured in the raids,
which were undertaken to fight organized illegal employment. Prosecutors
in Berlin accused the companies involved of tax evasion, illegally
employing foreign workers, and smuggling these workers into Germany.
According to official figures, more than 400 officers took part in the
operation in Berlin.

Central Council of German Sinti and Roma reacts to disparagement
</H1>
The Council of German Sinti and Roma rejects disparaging
remarks about members of that ethnic group. The object of the criticism is
a tourist publication about Majorca, which states: "Gypsies can
unfailingly tell when someone is new to Majorca; the unsuspecting can
easily find they are missing something valuable later". The chairman of
the Council, Rose, accuses several German and Swiss tour companies of
distributing this and other disparagements in their information packages.

Commercial rents way down

Shopkeepers renting commercial space are feeling the reluctance of Germans
to spend these days in a good way, too. Compared to last year, new rental
agreements in the large cities are now between 3.8 and 7.1 percent
cheaper. The Group of German Brokers announced that in some less
sought-after locations, rates were down as much as 14 percent. The highest
rents for commercial space are, as always, in the large economic centres,
especially in Munich.
