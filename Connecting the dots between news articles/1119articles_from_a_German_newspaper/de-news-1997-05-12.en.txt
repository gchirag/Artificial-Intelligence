Construction union declines compromise proposal
</H1>
The wage comittee of the 'Bau-Steine-Erden' union
rejected the arbitration proposal by a large majority. The committee
will not accept the cuts in sick-pay. According to the arbitration,
sick-pay for construction workers would be reduced to 80% of the
salary during the first three weeks of sick-leave. The construction
workers insist on 100%. The union is still willing to compromise, at
least until the period of declaration ends on May 21 at 4 pm CEDT.
Specifically, the union offered the employers further negotiations
about the sick-pay. In addition, it is willing to accept cuts in
details of the current wage contract as a compensation. However,
Wieshuegel confirmed that walkouts are inevitable, if an
understanding can not be achieved.

<P>
The associations of the construction industry will consult about the
compromise proposal on Tuesday and Wednesday. In response to the
decline from the union they said a strike would be a disaster for
the construction industry which is already hit hard by the
recession. Foreign subcontractors would be the only winners with
their low-paid workers from all over Europe, snapping contracts from
the German construction industry.

Bluem emphasizes coalition's willingness to compromise
</H1>
Minster of Labor Bluem emphasized the coalition's basic
willingness to compromise with the SPD in the dispute about the
pensions reform. Bluem said that all issues should be part of the
negotiations, but that there was no way other than unburdening the
pension insurance. Bluem rejected the accusation that the coalition
wanted to cut pensions. Instead, the goal is to reduce the annual
increase rate about an average of 0.4%.

SPD declines separate negotiations about the pension reform
</H1>
The SPD declined separate negotiations with the government
about the pension reform. In parliament the SPD is willing to
negotiate, but to party leader Lafontaine separate talks make no
sense. Lafontaine himself is prepared for private talks with
Minister of Labor Bluem about this topic. Bluem indicated that he
would dispense with the planned reduction of pensions if the SPD was
willing to talk. Fundamentally, Lafontaine said, his party is going
to talk about all proposals, provided that the pensions will not be
reduced to the level of social welfare assistance. Lafontaine asked
the governing coalition to deliver concrete proposals and to put a
bill for discussion in the parliament. The SPD plans to create a
bill concerning the pension reform itself after the summer vacation.
FDP leader Gerhard sees no alternatives to the pension plans of the
coalition: It is more honest to tell the pensioners that their
pensions will rise more slowly than to create new charges by
hurrying to redistribute finances.

Bluem criticizes SPD attitude
</H1>
Federal Minister of Labor Bluem blistered the SPD's refusal to
negotiate the pension reform, saying the party was trying to get out
of the shared responsibility. He said that this attitude was a
novelty in  post-war history and bad for the pension insurance. SPD
party leader Lafontaine had previously declined separate
negotiations about the planned pension reform with the coalition. On
the other side, Lafontaine reproached the coalition for leaving the
compromise about pensions without consultations with the SPD last
week.
