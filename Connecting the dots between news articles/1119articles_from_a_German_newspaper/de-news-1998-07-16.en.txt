Nursing care insurance criticized
</H1>
Politicians don't tire of praising nursing care insurance as a
successful additional mainstay of social security. Not so the
Mutual Welfare Society. In their opinion. an urgent review of
nursing care insurance is in order because existent laws disregard
the needs of recipients.
The Society's Bonn chapter said that clean and well-fed was the
reality of homes for the aged and the handicapped, that are under increasing
financial pressure. Hardly any time remains for
necessary psychological care, says the Society's general manager
Werner Hesse-Schiller. The Society proposes a one level upgrading
of persons with senile dementia so nurses could dedicate more of
their time to them. This would not constitute a financial problem
for the nursing care insurance office, as they have at this date
a surplus of DM 8 billion in the till. Also, the Mutual Welfare
Society demands reduction of the office's administrative cost.
They say a reform in this direction is overdue.

Further discussions around speed limits
</H1>
CSU goes on discussing around the speed limit issue. CSU vice
secretary general Joachim Herzog said in Munich that the
declaration of SPD leaders saying the party opposes the
Green party's demand for 100 km limit on the Autobahn and
30 km within city limits just could not be believed. In fact,
a draft law proposal by red/green state governments was before
the Bundesrat ever since late June. The quick reaction of
SPD's candidate for the chancellorship Gerhard Schroeder and
party general manager Franz Muentefering, declaring that
SPD was strictly against a 100 km speed limit on the Autobahn,
referring to a demand voiced by the Green fraction spokeswoman
on traffic affairs, Gila Altmann, ten days ago, was totally
untrustworthy, said Hermann during a press conference at
Munich's SPD state headquarters. On June 25th, the red/green
governments of Hamburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Schleswig-Holstein
and  Hesse hat submitted a joint proposal to the Bundesrat.
The other states were taken totally by surprise, and a discussion
date had been set for September 10th. Ins September, the staes
would have to put the cards on the table.

Experts warn against vacations
</H1>
According to data supplied by Hesse state's office for corporate
social security, one of every two vacationers show health problems
before or after their vacations. One person in fifty returns
from vacation with inability to work. In the experts' opinion,
many people tend to overestimate their capabilities and their
fitness and overwork their cardiac and circulatory systems.
But total laziness or overfeeding could likewise impair health.
