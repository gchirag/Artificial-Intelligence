</H1>

the "630 DM jobs" law. In an interview with "BILD am Sonntag," Riester
said that he sees no reason to change the law.  However, he did not rule
out changes and amendments to the new law on nominally independent
contract work, which is just as controversial. Riester rejected possible
nullification of the laws, which are also being criticized within the
party, or his resignation as Federal Minister of Labour.

</H1>
According to the news magazine "Der Spiegel," the permanent nuclear waste
disposal site at Morsleben can not be shut down for the time being.
Apparently nuclear waste that is giving off too much radiation is being
stored in the underground salt mine. The containers from the Greifswald
nuclear power station should apparently remain in Morsleben despite the
radioactive emissions. The authorities feel that the radiation level will
eventually decline enough to allow permanent disposal of the waste.
