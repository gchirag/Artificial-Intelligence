Restriction of SPD's debating time in Bavarian parliament unconstitutional
</H1>
The Bavarian Constitutional Court has admitted a case of the SPD
concerning the debating time in the Bavarian State parliament. The judges
ruled a restriction of the debating time unconstitutional. The case
has been about the debate in the summer of 1996 of the special Bavarian
abortion bill.

<P>
A member of parliament for the SPD called the ruling a clear succes for
his party. In particular, the rights of minorities in the State parliament
have been strengthened again. The head of the CSU faction in the Bavarian
parliament, Mr Glueck again reproached the SPD with having slowed down
the debate at the time. He keeps his position that the two Bavarian
abortion bills were debated comprehensively.
