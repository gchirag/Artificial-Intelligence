NATO intends to begin air-manoeuvres over Albania and Macedonia
</H1>
Because of the current Kosovo crisis, NATO intends to
begin air-manoeuvres over Albania and Macedonia as early as this Sunday,
according to a decision made by the NATO defence ministers at this spring's
meeting in Brussels. This is meant to demonstrate that the armed forces are
prepared and ready to act, and also to force Yugoslavian president Milosevic
to end violence in the Kosovo region. Four German Tornado fighter planes
will take part in the manoeuvres. The liaison group for the Balkan offered
Mr Milosevic an ultimatum: Great Britain's Foreign Minister Cook said at
one of the group's meetings in London that there would be consequences
if Mr Milosevic did not fulfil certain conditions. Some of the conditions
are: an armistice, supervised retreat of troops and the return of some
15,000 Kosovo-Albanian refugees to their homes.

Start of ecumenic dialogue
</H1>
Mr Maier, head of the Central Organisation of German Catholics,
hopes for common worship with protestants. Currently rules of the
Catholic church do not allow for this.

Mr Lehmann, president of the Conference of Catholic Bishops, announced

pregnant women was concerned. He also stated that a solution was needed
that did not imply an entitlement to abortion. So no-one in the

Speaker of the Parliament Suessmuth (Bundestagspraesidentin) had asked
the catholic church to stick with the state-system of counselling.
