Evacuation of refugees from Kosovo begins
</H1>
The first refugees from Kosovo are expected to be brought
to Germany tomorrow. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the
first planes will be reserved primarily for the old, the sick and those
in need of aid. The refugees will be brought to Bavaria first, and from
there will be divided amongst the various German states according to
standard refugee distribution policy. The initial plan is to provide
temporary shelter for 10.000 refugees. The Ministry of the Interior
stressed that field aid will remain a first priority. Foreign Affairs
Minister Fischer said that the systematic forcible displacement of the
Kosovar Albanians by Serb forces was being planned long ago. To insiders
the operation is known as 'Horseshoe'. The mass displacements are said
to have been planned as early as the peace negotiations of Rambouillet.
According to British statements, an estimated 1.1 million of the total
Kosovan population of 1.8 million are now either on the run or have been
forced out of the country.

</H1>
The B90/G (the Greens) spokesperson on defence matters, Beer, has
demanded a cease-fire in Kosovo. Beer says that the NATO must regain
political iniative and offer the Yugoslav President Milosevic a
cease-fire through an internationally accepted mediator. The cease-fire
must be subject to specific conditions, however. Military action must
not be allowed to autonatically lead to the deployment of ground troops.
This is also a position held by the lower house of parliament.
While making an appearance in the German television programme
ZDF-Morgenmagazin Mr. Kirchtag, the Inspector General of the German
Armed Forces, stressed that the deployment of NATO-groundtroops in
Kosovo will only be considered once a peace agreement has been reached.
Such troops would serve exclusively to ensure that an agreement is
adhered to and that the returning refugees are protected.
