</H1>
The Social-Democrats are now ready for new talks with the government about
the tax reform, according to a statement SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine made

talk outside established structures, away from the spotlights. Lafontaine

100th Annual Meeting of Physicians in Eisenach
</H1>
German President Roman Herzog asked both patients and physicians to be
more economic to save the health services. At the opening of the 100.
Annual Meeting of Physicians Herzog said in his speech that some health
service providers take as much from the health insurers as possible.
Similarly, patients should not act as if medical treatment and medicaments
were free goods. Herzog said public health insurance is for the medically
necessary and not for the fulfilment of sociopolitical wishes. President of
the Chamber of Physicians Mr. Vilmar underlined that, in future, public
health insurances would only be able to finance basic services. Vilmar said
on ARD television anything beyond the basics, e.g. maternity preparation
and vaccinations for foreign countries, had to be cancelled. Till Saturday,
the 250 delegates will discuss mainly social and health policy issues.

Oral court proceedings about Bavarian abortion law
</H1>
The Federal Constitutional Court has today considered the Bavarian separate
path regarding abortions. The Bavarian so-called pregnancy support
complementary law stipulates that a medical practice must not gain more
than 25% of its income from abortions. The law also prescribes a special
licence for physicians to execute abortions. The law is to become effective
on July 1. Two Bavarian physicians have challenged the law because it
affects the free execution of their profession. The two men conduct about
80% of all outpatient abortions in Bavaria. The State of Bavaria on the
other side points out that abortions are illegal according to a finding by
a federal court. The ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court is expected
in two weeks. Meanwhile, Bavaria has suggested the two physicians a
temporary solution by allowing them to continue their practice beyond June
30. Bavaria made the concession after the court showed concerns that
medical services may not be fully available to Bavarian women.
