Kosovo peace-keeping force to be beefed up
</H1>
The planned peace-keeping force for Kosovo is to be enlarged. The NATO
Council has thus agreed to meet the desires of the military leadership.
Rather than 28,000 soldiers, as previously intended, 45,000 to 50,000 will
now make up the force. The exact composition of the group, being called
KFOR, is not yet clear. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer discussed
the matter with his American counterpart, Madeleine Albright, today. The
force will be sent in when the war in Kosovo has ended. Its mission will
be to supervise the return of refugees to their homes.

EU employment pact does not name unemployment rate goal
</H1>
The employment pact which is expected to be passed at the EU summit next
week does not contain any hard data on the hoped-for reduction in
unemployment. Speaking in Brussels at the closing round of talks with his
European counterparts from both labour and finance ministries, German
Finance Minister Hans Eichel said that such figures were not really
meaningful anyway. He said they would only serve to invite setting the
lowest possible goals. The draft proposal for the employment pact, which
was discussed today, named reducing unemployment as the number one
priority in the European Union. To that end, the EU heads of government
and heads of state want to work towards a better dialogue between the
national governments, unions and managements, and the European Central
Bank when they meet again in early June.

Flooding of Lake Constance expected to worsen
</H1>
The hundred-year flood of Lake Constance may not have peaked yet.
Meteorologists are forecasting thunderstorms and high winds in the region
tonight. Experts also expect more spring run-off from melting snow in the
Alps due to warmer temperatures. The shores of the county of Konstanz, in
particular, are the scene of intense preparations for rising water levels.
The level there was measured at 5.63 metres this evening. Fire, ambulance,
and police forces are preparing for action if and when the water does rise
further. In communities on Lake Constance, many lakeside roads are already
under water. Shipping is severely restricted.

Textile employers present wage contract offer
</H1>
The employers in the textile industry today presented an offer in wage
contract talks. The offer is for 2.9 percent more money for employees. A
spokesman for the IG Metall union, however, was quite skeptical about the
offer, saying that it was an insufficient basis on which to form a deal.
He said that the minimum acceptable offer would start with a "3" in front
of the decimal place.
