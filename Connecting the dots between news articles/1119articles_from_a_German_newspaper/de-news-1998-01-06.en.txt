Traditional Epiphany congress of FDP in Stuttgart
</H1>
FDP party leader Wolfgang Gerhardt has called on his party to stop the
internal quarreling. Mr. Gerhardt said at the traditional Liberal Epiphany
congress in Stuttgart that the political opponent was the one to be fought.
He, Gerhardt, would defend the party's established direction. The wrongest
thing for the FDP to do now would be to deviate from the current path.

<P>
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Walter
Doering also demanded an end to the arguments within the party. Kinkel
demanded more resoluteness and moral courage. The Liberals should aim at
preventing a red-green [Social-Democrat--Alliance90/Green] or a Grand
Coalition [CDU/CSU/SPD] in the 1998 general elections. FDP
secretary-general Guido Westerwelle announced that the party would deal
with Alliance90/Greens during the election campaign because they
represented a threat to Germany's Liberality. Before the congress former
justice minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger repeated her criticism
of the FDP's leadership. In a radio interview she questioned again the tone
used to rebuke her criticism. She reproached especially
Baden-Wuerttemberg's FDP leader Walter Doering with slander. To reject
concerns of the party's left wing as boastful twaddle. The FDP politician
who belongs to the left-Liberal Freiburger Kreis demanded again that her
party must insist on more liberality within the party. It was not
sufficient to concentrate on economic and finance politics. Yesterday,
leading FDP politicians had called on the party to show more unanimity and
demanded to end the unnecessary internal discussions.

German Telekom will not charge fee for switching long-distance carrier
</H1>
Deutsche Telekom AG [the former monopolist for long-distance phone calls]
renounces fees for switching customers to other long-distance carriers for
the time being. The change of mind came about because the regulatory
authority has deemed that such fees needed their approval. Customers who
have already paid the fee will be reimbursed, those who have received an
invoice should disregard it. This regulation is in effect until the
regulation authority decides definitively.

Stricter border controls because of Kurdish refugees?
</H1>
Baden-Wuerttemberg's State Premier Erwin Teufel has called on the federal
government to insist more on the protection of the external EU borders from
illegal immigrants. According to the state government Mr. Teufel wrote in a
letter to Chancellor Helmut Kohl that quick and decisive action was
mandatory. It was known that illegal immigrants chose the route from Italy
and France to Baden-Wuerttemberg. Mr. Teufel demanded border checks at the
German-French border by the Border Guards. According to Interior Minister
Manfred Kanther the federal government has taken all measures against a
possible wave of Kurdish refugees into Germany. Kanther said in a radio
interview that the Border Guards at the southern and western borders had
been backed up.

<P>
The president of the police union, Mr. Lutz, rejected more police controls
at  German borders. The refugee problem could not be solved by improving
the control at German borders. Rather, Turkey had to change its Kurds
policy. Lutz also advocated to fight international refugee traffickers by
more international cooperation. CDU law expert Rupert Scholz, however,
called for a closure of the German borders if Italy could not secure its
borders more effectively.
