Stiff sentences in Mahlow trial
</H1>
The Postdam Regional Court passed sentences on two young right-wing
extremists who attacked black British construction workers in Mahlow. They
were sentenced to eight and five years in prison. The court considered it
established that an accident last June was caused by the men aged 18 and 24.
<P>

They chased the British workers and threw a rock at their car, causing
serious injuries when the workers' car hit a tree and overturned. One of the
victims is now paraplegic.

<P>
In his reasoning, the presiding judge pointed out increasing xenophobia among
adolescents, saying it was growing increasingly open and aggressive. He also
chided the federal constitutional protection agency. The agency had stated
only this year that rightwing violence had consolidated to a fairly low
level. Judge Czibilla warned that this was not true, hinting at the presence
of many youth with shaved heads who crowded the courtroom's public section.
They commented on the sentence with impudent calls of "This can't be true"
before leaving the courtroom.

Postage rates to increase September 1, 1997
</H1>
The German mail service corporation (Deutsche Post AG) was granted permission
to raise the cost of mailing letters and postcards on September 1, 1997. The
decision was made by the federal and state postal regulation council in Bonn.
After the increase, stamps for a letter will cost 1.1 marks and postcard
stamps will cost one mark. Additional service such as registered mail,
valuable mail, or express mail, will become more expensive, as will the
mailing of larger letters. The Post AG hopes to make an additional 800
billion marks per year. The decision was preceded by fierce debates regarding
postage and plans to close unprofitable post offices. FDP and SPD had opposed
an earlier increase.

</H1>
Russia again expressed opposition to plans to extend NATO to the east.
At the OSCE summit in Lisbon, minister president Chernomyrdin said his
country opposes NATO plans to move the organization in the direction of
Russia. In a written statement, Russian president Yeltsin warned against a
new separation of Europe. US vice president Gore advocated an agreement
between NATO and Russia. Speaking on ZDF TV, German foreign minister Kinkel
also called for a continued integration of Russia, saying this was the
central and strategically decisive question at the conference. Kinkel stated
that there would be no peace and quiet and no sufficient security for
everybody in Europe without Russia.

<P>
Chancellor Kohl supported the integration of Russia in a new security
structure. He also called on the OSCE members to approach Eastern Europe in
more ways than before, saying the western border of Poland was unacceptable
as the permanent eastern border of the European Union. Kohl emphasized that
Russia and the Ukraine had to find places appropriate to their size and
significance within a unifying Europe.

minister Waigel, said the commission discussed a raise from currently 15% to

CDU considers lowering of pension level a possibility
</H1>
The social association VDK has accused the federal government of
preparing a reduction of the pension level by presenting survey results on
the fast increase of retirees' incomes. The head of the association,
Hirlinger (sp?), criticized that the CDU/CSU/FDP coalition was trying to find
an excuse for a radical pension reduction with the help of an irresponsible
hodgepodge of numbers. Hirlinger referred to a survey commissioned by the
federal ministry of employment. Published last weekend, it says that the
incomes of old age pensioners in Germany had increased faster than workers'
incomes. The CDU had reacted to the survey by saying that it indicated
margins for a lowering of the pension level.

Bluem opposes presence of scientologists in civil service
</H1>
Federal employment minister Norbert Bluem opposes the employment of members
of the Scientology church in the civil service. At a rallye organized by the
CDU youth organization Junge Union in front of the German Scientology
headquarters in Hamburg, Bluem said that he did not want to have his children
educated by teachers with a totalitarian conviction. The organization's
disregard for democracy was wellknown, the minister said and emphasized that
he did not support a ban, relying on the power of arguments instead.
