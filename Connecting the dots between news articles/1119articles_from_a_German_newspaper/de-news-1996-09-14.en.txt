 After the Bundestag's passage of its savings package on
Friday, the government coalition wants to continue in the curtailment
in state and social insurance expenses.  Federal Health Minister
Seehofer said in a newspaper interview that the resolutions passed
thus far were only a minimal package.  Much more would have to be
saved.  According to a report in the magazine FOCUS, Mr. Seehofer
perhaps wishes to have German unemployed persons replace foreign
seasonal workers.  In this way, billions could be saved within the
Federal Labor Office.  The  FDP economic expert, Mr. Weng, said, he

</H1>
In Baden-Wuerttemberg, the DGB (German Alliance of
Unions) has called for a major social alliance against the

Metalworkers' Union Faces Imminent Curtailment of Sickpay
</H1>
 In the traditional pilot district of the metal workers -
North Baden - approximately 650 000 metalworkers face imminent
curtailment of sickpay.  This announcement was made by the head of
the alliance of the metal industry in Baden- Wuerttemberg, Mr. Hund,
in a conversation with the news agency dpa.  He stated that he
considered the regulation contained in the basic wage agreement to be
purely declaratory and not binding.  For this reason, the new savings
package law would automatically cover metal workers' employers.
To be sure, the executive board had not as yet made such a decision,
Mr. Hund, who is also the President-Elect of the Federal Alliance of
German Employers' Organizations, continued.

</H1>
 In the future, health insurance organizations will only be
allowed to raise contribution levels if they simultaneously  raise

Defense Ministry Repudiates General's Remarks
</H1>
The Federal Ministry for Defense has repudiated remarks concerning
the continuation of the Bosnia engagement without limits of time
which were made by the commanding officer of the allied armed forces
of Central Europe, General Stoeckmann.  According to the Ministry,
these remarks were unauthorized and erroneous in content.
A spokesperson in Bonn said on Saturday that the German army general
was not justified in  expressing an opinion about the length of a
mandate not yet decided upon.  This, he stated was a matter for
politics.  General Stoeckmann had declared on Friday, German
participation in a new Bosnia troop deployment would be desirable
without time constraints.

No Clear Consensus on Return of Refugees
</H1>
A few days before the conference of federal and state ministers of
the interior, there still seems to be no clear consensus concerning
the return of Bosnian refugees.   Speaking to the news Magazine DER
SPIEGEL, the minister of the interior of Schleswig-Holstein expressed
his disagreement with beginning the forced return as early as October
first.  Making these people leave before the beginning of winter
would be unreasonable, since 60 % of dwellings and homes had been
destroyed, he stated.  everything pointed in the direction of not
setting a deadline, the SPD politician said.  On the other hand,
after returning from a reconnaissance trip, his colleagues from Lower
Saxony, Hamburg and Bavaria declared that they wanted to stay with
the first of October.  That is also the position of Federal Minister
of the Interior Kanther.

</H1>
 the German League for the Protection of children has
charged that the federal government does not do enough to protect
children from violence.  Referring to the World Day of the Child on
September 20, the president of the organization, Mr. Hilgers, stated
that politicians were ignorant when it came to dealing with the UN
convention on the rights of children.  Thus, the government
has been refusing to adopt education without the use of force, which
is a provision of the convention, in its reform of children's rights.
This, he said, results in the continuing legality of corporal
punishment.
