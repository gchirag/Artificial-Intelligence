Report on Children and Youth published
</H1>
Family Minister Claudia Nolte has  presented today the Report on Children
and Youth that had been withheld so far.  According to expert opinion the
situation of families with children has  deteriorated radically in Germany.
Increasingly more children had to live of  social assistance. In East
Germany, 22 percent and in West Germany 12 percent of  all children are
classified as poor. One of the highest risks for poverty is  separation of
the parents according to the report.
The federal government  rejected the report. Mrs. Nolte particularly
rejected the definition of poverty  as having available less than half the
average income. Further, the equation of  poverty with payments of social
assistance was unsuitable. Nolte said that an  economist should have been
member of the Children and Youth Committee. Instead,  Family Minister Nolte
emphasized that even according to numbers presented by the  experts, the
proportion of poor children had decreased significantly since the  1980s.
So far, the federal government had tripled the assistance for families  and
will improve them even in the coming legislature period.
The president of  the parliamentary Family Committee, Edith Niehues, SPD,
reproached Mrs. Nolte of  minimizing child poverty and of hiding behind
definition issues. Similar  comments had Christa Nickels, GREEN member of
parliament. The Kinderschutzbund  (Children Protection Alliance) pointed
out that the method to measure child  poverty was uniform in all EU
countries.

Schroeder: Lafontaine will be tied into eventual SPD government
</H1>
In case of a government take-over the  SPD candidate for chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder is going to include party  president Oskar Lafontaine in
the cabinet. In an interview with the daily  Rheinische Post Schroeder
stressed, however, that Lafontaine would not head a  super-ministry for
finances and economics.
Lafontaine in turn confirmed his  intention to take a federal office in
case of an SPD election victory. On SAT1  television Lafontaine said that
he would run for faction leadership if the  party's majority was slim. But
if the majority was stable he might also assume a  government office,
especially the finance ministry.

would decide not only about the government but also about  its leader, the
disadvantages would surmount the advantages. Therefore, Kohl's  decision
was right.
