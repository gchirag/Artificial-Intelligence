EU Commission opposes exceptions from eco tax
</H1>
The EU Commission apparently opposes the ecological
tax planned by the German government. According to the daily
"Hamburger Abendblatt", the commission is against the
exception of numerous industrial sectors, which are understood
to be unlawful subsidies. Van Miert, the commissioner for fair
competition, pretends to consult with finance minister
Lafontaine on the matter of the ecological tax. The commission
can take Germany to the European Court for disregarding fair
competition legislation.

Health minister rebuts criticism by medical community
</H1>
Fischer, minister for health, again rebutted criticism
of new health legislation. Kust 3 days before the nationwide
protests of doctors integrating the public health system,
Fischer said the expenditure cuts in the system were
unavoidable. But this conflict must not affect patients.
She appealed to doctors for a change in the medical fee
system. The difficulties of part of the medical professions
did not stem from the government's health policies, but
rather from an inadequate distribution of fees among doctors.
She said the present system created inadequately directed
incentives and put some segments of the medical community
at a disadvantage. Barmer Ersatzkasse, a major health
insurance company, as well as the public health insurance
carrier of Baden-Wuerttemberg also came out against the
planned doctors' strike.

Renters warn against lack of living space and spiralling cost
</H1>
The Association of German Renters is warning against
renewed lack of available living space and mounting rent
prices. Chairwoman of the association Ms. Fuchs demanded
a reform of rent subsidy legislation as early as next year.
She founded her alarm against rising cost on the fact of
the diminishing number of building permits requested. In
the Western part of Germany, only 160,000 living units
have been completed this year. The rent increase rate
lies at a yearly 2%, twice the overall price rate.
