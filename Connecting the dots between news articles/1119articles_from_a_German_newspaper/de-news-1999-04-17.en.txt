Increasing atrocities in Kosovo
</H1>
NATO concedes that it is possible that 3,000 Kosovo Albanians have been
killed by Serb forces within the last three weeks.  These estimates are
supported by eye witness reports.  Air surveillance photographs also seem
to show a growing number of mass graves in Kosovo.  The stream of refugees
moving into neighboring countries continues unabated.  Since yesterday,
Serb forces have driven more than 25,000 people from Kosovo to Albania,
Macedonia and Montenegro, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
reported.  Based on the figures published by the UNHCR in recent days, only
some 375,000 ethnic Albanians remain in Kosovo.  The large refugee camps in
neighboring countries are already hopelessly overloaded.  Smaller camps are
now needed, but those have not yet been set up.  The UN is considering
evacuating more Kosovo refugees to other countries due to Macedonia's
refusal to establish further refugee camps.  The USA and Canada, for
example, have offered to accept 30,000 refugees, but have not been taken up
on that offer.  Albania has requested further financial assistance.  Aid
from the European Union, already approved, is no longer sufficient because
the number of refugees to receive assistance was underestimated, a
spokesperson of the Albanian government said.  In yesterday's raids of
Yugoslav ground troops, NATO destroyed seven tanks, according to NATO
headquarters.  According to Commander-in-Chief Clark, the alliance will
step up its attacks on targets in Yugoslavia.  Clark said that President
Milosevic must give in, otherwise NATO would destroy everything that is
important to him.

Fischer opposes deployment of ground troops
</H1>
The former EU Balkan negotiator, Mr. Bildt of Sweden, considers the air
strikes against Yugoslavia a failure.  The NATO attacks have increased
human suffering. Ground troops should be deployed now, Mr. Bildt said in an
interview with the news magazine "Focus."  The Bosnia specialist of the
federal government, Mr. Koschnik, told "Bild am Sonntag" that the
likelihood for ground troop deployment rises the longer the war drags on.
Foreign Minister Fischer, however, said in an interview with "Der Spiegel"
that the NATO strategy without ground troops is the correct one. Yugoslav
President Milosevic will lose in the end, he added.
