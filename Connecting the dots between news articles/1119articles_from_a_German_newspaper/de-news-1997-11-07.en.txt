SPD: there still is a chance contributions to pension-scheme will not rise
</H1>
The Social Democrats think there still are chances the contribution-rate to
the public pension scheme would not have to rise to 21%. Yesterday cabinet
had decided on the rise, but also declared that they were looking for
compromises until the Upper House (Bundesrat) had had their say. Head of the
SPD Lafontaine now stated, that his party would offer raising excise-duty on
motor-spirits and sales tax, while lowering contributions to the public
pension-scheme and the public unemployment-scheme by 1% each. Today
Lower Saxony's premier Schroeder tabled this proposal in the Upper House
(Bundesrat).

Mr Roestel thinks there should be a change of power in Bonn
</H1>
Head of the Greens party Roestel asked for a change of power in Bonn.
The current government had jeopardised Germany as a country for doing
business in, what with bleeding dry patients, putting pensions at risk and
continuously raising taxes and contributions. After the upcoming federal
elections, a straight swap of Chancellor Kohl for Chancellor  Lafontaine or
Chancellor Schroeder would not do. They would, however, only talk about
compromises if and when they had been successful at the polls.

Ministry of Defence confirms part of TV-documentary
</H1>
The Ministry of Defence confirmed parts of a TV-documentary produced by
WDR-magazine "Monitor" about the mid-air collision of a German air-force
Tupolev and a US air-force plane off the coast of Namibia. All 24
passengers were killed in the crash. Now the ministry admitted that some
details of the flight-plan, e.g. flight-levels, had been provided by a
private company. The data, however, had been checked by the crew - contrary
to what the documentary had stated. Wrong flight-levels allegedly had been
the cause of the crash.

Mr Solana on Bosnian peace-keeping mission
</H1>
NATO General Secretary Solana said that he expected all countries who were
currently involved in the international peace-keeping mission in Bosnia to
keep doing so after June 1998, when their current mandate will expire. At a
meeting of the Konrad-Adenauer-Fund in Berlin, he added that he expected all
war-criminals to be taken to court - though, according to the Dayton
Accords, NATO would have no say in the apprehension of alleged criminals.

<P>
Previously the General Secretary had had talks with Berlin's Lord Mayor
Diepgen. Mr Diepgen emphasised that he would keep re-patriating refugees
from former Yugoslavia in a consistent manner.
