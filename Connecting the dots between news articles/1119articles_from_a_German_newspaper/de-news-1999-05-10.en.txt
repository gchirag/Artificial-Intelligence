Moderate reaction on news about retreat
</H1>
The Western States reacted with skepticism on news about a supposed partly
retreat of Yugoslavian forces out of the Kosovo. Defense Minister Scharping
called this only a propaganda maneuver. He emphasized that so far, there are no
signs for such a retreat. A NATO-speaker in Brussels said the same. He referred
to the possibility that Belgrade speaks of a retreat, while in reality only an
exchange takes place. The US-President, Clinton, and the British Prime Minister,
Blair, reminded that the NATO demands much more than only a retreat of troops.
It would be very important that the refugees could return safely. An
international guarding force would be necessary. The special commissioner of the
EU for the Balkan, Petric, declared that the news from Belgrade must be examined
very carefully. In the best case, the new circumstances could lead to a
de-escalation. Today, the air attacks of the NATO continued unchanged.

</H1>
With a great majority, the SPD party council supports Chancellor Schroeder's
position in the Kosovo conflict. A proposal for a one-sided cease-fire was
rejected by the members of the council. According to Schroeder, this proves the
support of the SPD for the government. But on Thursday at the federal delegates
assembly in Bielefeld, the executive board of the Greens will make the proposal
of a one-sided ease-fire. The speaker of the executive board Roestel, emphasized
that harmonizes with the policy of foreign minister Fischer. Chancellor
Schroeder shortens his visit to China from four days to one. According to his
foreign policy counselor, Steiner, it is the aim of the dialogue on Wednesday to
win over the Chinese to support a diplomatic solution for the Kosovo-conflict
instead of the bombardment of their embassy in Belgrade. A jointly position in
the UN security council is absolutely necessary. Upon China's application, the
council will meet today in New York to discuss the incident. In Paris, the
French president Chirac regretted the bombardment of the embassy. He was talking
of an accident and expressed an understanding for Beijing's reaction. There
happened new demonstrations in front of the embassies of the USA and Great
Britain. In the evening, Chancellor Schroeder was informed by NATO
secretary-general about the circumstances of the attack on the embassy. So far,
the Chancellor had called the statements as insufficient.
