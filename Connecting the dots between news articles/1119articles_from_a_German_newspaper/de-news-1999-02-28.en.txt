Deutsche Post wage negoations
</H1>
The third round of wage negotiations for the 170,000 workers and
employees of the Deutsche Post began this afternoon.  The Union is
demanding a 5.5 percent wage increase, increased vacation pay,
profit-sharing and that trainees be taken on as full-time staff.
Management has not yet made a counterproposal.  Wage negotiations for the
post office and telecommunications (Telekom) sectors are being conducted
separately and will be continued either later this evening [Sunday] or

Schroeder proposes a compromise for double-citizenship law
</H1>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has proposed a compromise in the discussion
on the new citizenship law. In an interview, he proposed a limited period
of double-citizenship where those affected would have to choose at some
stage which passport they would like to retain.  Mr. Oehme, spokesman for
the FDP, called on Mr. Schroeder to specify what age this should happen
and said that the FDP would proposed the age of eighteen. Ms. Radke,
speaker for the executive committee of the Greens, has demanded that the
new citizenship law  be passed even without approval from the Bundesrat
[upper house of parliament], saying that this would be one way of
splitting the law.  Mr. Schroeder said that it is hard to cope with the
number of immigrants to Germany and that the problem could only be solved
at a European level. He proposed that the issue of a communal European
immigration policy should be on the agenda at a future EU summit.

Wage policy
</H1>
In the aftermath of the public service wage agreement, Mr. Clement, the
premier minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, has proposed that wage policy
should be included in the upcoming talks in Bonn on the "Alliance for
Work".  He said in a newspaper interview that it would make sense to
agree to a moderate wage policy for a certain period of time and that the
areas of responsibility of the negotiating parties in future negotiations
should not be changed.  Employers have also demanded that wage policy
should be included in the talks although the unions have rejected this.
The wage agreement for the public service has been criticised as being
too high by politicians from the CDU/CSU and FDP.  They say that pressure
on public households will increase and lead to a further decrease in
employment.  The 3.2 million employees in public service will receive a
3.1 percent increase from April 1 and a one-off payment of 300 marks for
the period between January and March.

SPD considers collaboration with the PDS possible
</H1>
The SPD leadership holds the opinion that it could be possible to
collaborate with the PDS.  Oskar Lafontaine, leader of the SPD, along
with Mr. Schreiner, Secretary General of the party, also thinks that the
so-called "Dresden Statement" no longer is applicable. This is a
statement to the effect that the SPD would not collaborate with the PDS.
Mr. Lafontaine said that this statement is totally outdated and has been
overtaken by events in reality.

Koschnik supports German participation in Kosovo military operation.
</H1>
Koschnik, the federal government's representative for Bosnia is of
the opinion that  Germany should participate in an international Kosovo
military operation.  Mr. Koschnik said that this should still be the case
even if the Serbs and Kosovo Albanians do not sign a peace agreement. The
purpose, he said, would not only be to prevent new atrocities in the
Balkans.  A policy of non-intervention could also attract a large stream
of refugees to Germany. Serbs and Albanians will meet in the middle of
March in France to continue their peace talks.
