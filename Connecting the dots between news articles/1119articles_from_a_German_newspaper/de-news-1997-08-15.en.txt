Government apparently wants to raise taxes on consumption
</H1>
The governing coalition-parties apparently intend to raise sales-tax by
two percentage points at the beginning of next year, to pay for tax- and
pension-reforms. And, according to news agencies, a rise in excise-duty
on motor-spirits is being discussed as well.  The above measures would
enable social-security contributions to drop by some 30 billion marks, as
the opposition SPD-party had requested. Penalty-rates for after-hours work,
however, would remain tax-free, according to the coalition-parties.

Bremen's shipbuilder Vulkan now definitely closed down, afer more than
100 years in the trade. When the word came through, around midday, that
this would be the last shift, staff unfurled black flags and some left their
hard hats outside the company's gate. Now 2000 workers lost their jobs.
The last ship they had built, a container-vessel, had left the works
yesterday.

Mr Ruehe will react to neonazis in the Armed Forces
</H1>
Defence Minister Ruehe wants strong reactions to right-wing neonazi
tendencies. Following the attack, by two soldiers, on a home for persons
seeking asylum in Dresden, he decided that no criminals would serve in the
Armed Forces, in the future. He suggested police and courts inform the
draft boards accordingly. This was not about soldiers' conscience, but
rather making sure no known or active neonazi would hurt the Armed Forces
by serving in them. The Soldiers' Association asked for better training
as far as political science was concerned.
