FDP may keep money - for the time being
</H1>
The FDP party will not have to pay back the contentious 10.5 million marks
they received from government, for the time being. They will, however, get
'backpay' to the tune of 5.7 million marks, a sum that had been frozen so
far while the courts were still looking at the matter. This followed a
decision by the Muenster Administrative Court, which effectively quashed
the former ruling by a Cologne court. The latter had decided last November
that government would have to ask for the monies to be refunded immediately.

Tiff between coalition partners about nuclear storage facility
</H1>
The intermediate storage facility for nuclear waste at Lubmin in
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania caused a bit of a tiff between coalition
partners. Minister for Internal Affairs Jaeger, of the CDU, had agreed to
setting up the storage facility for nuclear waste from the nuclear power
plants at Greifswald and Rheinsberg, among others. The SPD, however,
thought that he had breached the coalition agreement by doing so.

Huge deployment of police for transport of nuclear waste
</H1>
The biggest deployment of police ever will take place when nuclear waste
in a so-called CASTOR-container will be sent to the intermediate storage
facility at Aarhaus. A total of 6 containers will be on their way at the
end of March. A year ago, 30,000 police were deployed for the transport of a
container to another storage facility (at Gorleben), but this pale in
comparison to this year's numbers.

Police retrace murderer's steps
</H1>
Police had had some success in the investigation of schoolgirl Karla's
murder, as they probably managed to retrace where her murderer went
when he fled. Two witnesses claimed they saw him race his car from
Wilhermsdorf to the next village. Police issued bills asking the general
public for hints and tip-offs.

<P>
12-year old Karla from Wilhermsdorf near Fuerth was on her way to school on
22 January, when she was raped by a person unknown so far, and dumped in a
pond. She died 5 days later.
