Top-level talks with Bluem about employment policies
</H1>
Leading representatives of the unions and business associations have met
with Federal Labour Minister Bluem to discuss federal employment policies.
The meeting was held to develop an action plan on unemployment, which the
federal government had committed itself to at an EU employment summit
meeting last November. Bonn has turned its attention specifically to youth
unemployment and to the re-integration of those who have been out of the
labour market for long periods. The government does not plan to release
any new monies into its employment programs, according to vice-chairman of
the German Federation of Unions, Engelen-Kefer. Bluem does, however, want
to extend the government's program benefitting the long-term unemployed.

Kohl warns against drastic increases in gasoline prices
</H1>
Chancellor Kohl has warned against a drastic increase in the cost of
gasoline, saying that a price of 5 DM/litre, as the Greens are calling
for, would put jobs and investments at risk. Kohl was speaking at the
celebratory opening of the new headquarters of auto manufacturer Opel in
Ruesselsheim, Hesse. At the same time, Kohl called for continued
reductions in noise and air pollution from autos. Opel's chairman of the
board, Hermann, said that he stood behind Standort Deutschland (Germany as
a base for economic activity), and pointed out that the company had spent
over DM 4 billion just on the development of its new model, the Astra. He
added that Opel was planning further investments.

First round of negotiations in public sector arbitration
</H1>
Arbitration has begun in the contract dispute in the public sector. The
member of the arbitration team for the employees, an SPD politician,
Koschnik, plans to table a suggested settlement in five days. He judged
the overall situation as being difficult, saying "The ice is pretty thin,
and the cow is pretty fat."
Following the first round of negotiations, the arbitrators expressed
cautious optimism. Koschnik said the talks showed there was a possibility
of success, although "the devil hides in the details". He added that both
sides agreed on the principle of a consensual solution, and wanted to
avoid a strike.
The other arbitrator, former Rhineland-Palatinate Premier Wagner, said the
plan was to try to put together a package deal acceptable to both sides.
He also said that the sticking points seemed to be employment security ,
sick pay continuance, and the issue of extra old age security.
The arbitration talks resume on Monday.

Kanther still rejects halting deportation of Kosovo-Albanians
</H1>
Federal Internal Affairs Minister Kanther has reiterated his assessment
that there is presently no reason to implement a general halt on
deportations of Albanians from the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo.
Speaking on Deutschlandfunk radio, Kanther suggested especially that such
a move could send a signal that would induce many others to go to Germany,
hoping to then remain in the country. The minister also accused several of
the German states with SPD-led governments of abdicating the joint
responsibility for deporting foreigners. Kanther emphasized Albanians from
Kosovo would not be deported if their lives were threatened.

Government expects unemployment numbers to drop
</H1>
The federal government is expecting economic growth of between 2.5 and 3
percent for the current year. The information comes from the 1998 Economic
Report which was passed by the cabinet today. Federal Economic Minister
Rexrodt told journalists in Bonn that the number of unemployed was going
to sink for the first time in four years and, in December, would be about
200,000 less than at the end of 1997.
The SPD and Alliance/Greens said it was unclear where the upturn was
supposed to come from, and that the predicted growth was insufficient to
create new jobs.

Inflation in Germany may be less than believed
</H1>
According to a study by the German Central Bank, prices are increasing
significantly more slowly than official statistics indicate. The Central
Bank's Economic Research Group in Frankfurt explained that the monthly
cost-of-living index may over-estimate the actual inflation rate by more
than 3/4 of a percent. According to the group , the largest source of
error was that the Federal Statistics Office failed to take into full
account changes in quality or the introduction of new models of products;
also changes in consumer behaviour were not calculated in quickly enough.
According to the Bank's reasoning, inflation in Germany is approaching
zero.
