Chancellor Kohl meets Hong Kong's future top administrator
</H1>
When China takes over, the existing economic system will stay, the future
top administrator, Mr Tung, told Chancellor Kohl. China will honour her
guarantees for the 50-year transitional phase. Mr Tung stated that Germany
was one of Hong Kong's most important trade-partners, and hoped that business
would grow even more after the take-over by China. Mr Kohl welcomed
Mr Tung's statements, and went on to meet the Crown Colony's outgoing
Governor General Chris Patton. On the way back home, he wants to take a
break at Kazakhstan's capital Alma Ata, and talk to president Nasarbajev.

Mr Geissler defends arbitrator's decision for construction industry
</H1>
And he also claimed the decision was feasible from a social-policy standpoint.
There would have been only one alternative: industrial action.
Yesterday the agreement was finalised, lowering the end-of-year bonus
(currently the equivalent of one month's pay) for 1.3 million workers in the
construction industry. And paid sick-leave is also to stay at 80% of your
wage for the first three weeks, rising to 100% thereafter.

SPD accuses government of having dragged their feet while rebuilding East
</H1>
The drive to have the new states catch up with the existing ones had
come to a halt, and the process of boosting former East Germany's economy
was a never-ending story. Head of the SPD parliamentary group, Mr Scharping,
and one of his managers, Mr Schwanitz, said that Chancellor Kohl's policies
had failed completely. There was a real danger of East Germany becoming
Germany's home for the destitute. The SPD pointed out that there was an
extreme lack of jobs, mainly in industry, looming closures of companies
formerly run by the Treuhand-Gesellschaft (for re-structuring and
privatisation), a lack of equity in businesses and an almost total demise of
independent research and development. These days East Germany was a
half-dead body, and government apparently using the required subsidies to
finance their failed policies. The SPD, however, wanted to put a stop on
procrastination and the good-news machine.

Government wants to decommission Morsleben till 2005
</H1>
Federal Minister for the Environment Merkel justified the decision
claiming that the planned final storage sites for nuclear waste at Gorleben
and Schacht Konradt (literally: (salt)-mine pit Konradt) in Lower Saxony
would be able to handle nuclear waste in the foreseeable future. And apart
from that, the former GDR finale storage site of Morsleben would only be fit
for low- and medium radioactive waste. The minister emphasised expressly that
safety-concerns had not led to this decision: it could have been run
safely and responsibly. A Saxony-Anhalt government spokesperson, however,
did not agree: he pointed out that according to the re-unification treaty
the permit for running the site would expire as early as in the year 2000.
Government was only trying to make everyone believe they had relented, and
thus tried to get the permit extended for another 3 to 5 years.

Baden-Wuerttemberg's administration to cut jobs
</H1>
Head of the CDU-parliamentary group Oettinger thinks there should
be a lot more staff-cuts than planned so far, and he wants state government
to get stuck into the problem once again. Between 1993 and 2001 more than
7000 staff are to be made redundant anyway, but Mr Oettinger thought
otherwise: if all new positions were taken into consideration, for example
the 1,600 additional jobs for teachers, the net savings would amount to a
measly 812, and in his view that was not enough. Only schools, universities
and the police are to be exempt. The goals is to drive costs for staff below
the 40% (of the state's budget) mark. Too much money for staff would stifle
the state's policies and jeopardise the budget.

according to the tabloid BILD, who in turn refer to a report by the Federal
Criminal Police Office (BKA). They claim that every other organised crime
committed and investigated in Germany was of the Mafia's making. The BKA
expects the proportion of organised criminals from the Balkan countries to
grow in the future.

Regional court dismisses biological farmer's complaint
</H1>
The Stuttgart Regional Court dismissed a biological farmer's
complaint against the Nuertingen Polytech's field-trial using genetically
engineered sweet turnips. The farmer had wanted the Polytech to regularly
check his soil making sure no genetically engineered material would be
transferred to his biologically-grown produce. The court thought that the
risk of that happening was minimal, and not an issue for the time being.
