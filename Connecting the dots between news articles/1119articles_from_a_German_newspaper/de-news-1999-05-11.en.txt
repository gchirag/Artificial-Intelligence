Fischer: No sign for quick solution in Kosovo conflict
</H1>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer does not expect an end of
the Kosovo war very soon. At a meeting of Foreign and Defense Ministers of
the West-European Union in Bremen, Mr Fischer said the G8 meeting last week
was an important step [towards a solution] but not yet a break trough
towards peace [in the region]. Mr Fischer called the bombing of the Chinese
embassy an inexcusable mistake that however should not hinder international
peace efforts. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder will try to promote
"communication" [between NATO and China] during his visit [to Beijing].

Before the party convention of the Greens: Opinions on Kosovo conflict
</H1>
Faction leader of the Greens in the Bundestag (lower house of
parliament) Rezzo Schlauch expects that his party will become stronger
through the ongoing debate on the Kosovo war. In an interview Mr Schlauch
said the Kosovo war obliges the Greens to clarify their understanding of
pacifism and human rights. However, fellow party member Ms Mueller warned
against a break up of the party. Neither the pacifist section of the party
nor the supporters of the government policies could survive independently,
though. Environment Minister Juergen Trittin stressed that the Green
faction in the Bundestag was not obliged to follow a resolution of the
upcoming Bielefeld special party convention. The had just to consider it in
its deliberations. Green Bundestag Vice President Antje Vollmer called for

</H1>

streetcar line trough Munich's inner city park English Garden. Finance
Minister Mr. Faltlhauser wrote to Mayor Mr. Ude that he could not approve
of that part of the line because of concerns for natural and cultural
preserves. There was also no demand for a streetcar line as there are
already sufficient underground, city train and bus lines. The Bavarian
