Coalition and Union critizise Riester's pension plans
</H1>
Federal Minister of Labor Riester has encountered criticism with his
pension plans within his own SPD party and at the coalition partner
alliance 90/The Green party. The social-democratic Prime Minister of the
Saarland, Klint, expressed opposition in a newspaper article against a
temporary coupling of the pension adjustment to the inflation rate.
Green executive spokeswoman Roestel deplored that a democratic factor is
missing which reflects the change in the age structure of the
population. Spokeswoman Mueller of the Green Party said in Bonn that if
no agreement could be reached among the pension specialists in Bonn, a
solution must be found in the coalition round. The CDU called the
suggested mandatory private supplementary provision unconstitutional and
announced proceedings against it. Speakers of DGB, IG Metall and IG Bau
criticized that the additional provision should be charged alone to
employees. Federal Minister of Finance Eichel rejected the criticism. He
explained in Wiesbaden the age structure of society would make a private
provision necessary.

</H1>
The controversy over the 630-DM-Law and over the reorganization of the
currency independence continues. The Union faction today presented the
Bundestag in Bonn with a request in which the government is requested to
take the amendment back immediately. The laws are a slap in the face for
industrious persons and promote moonlighting, criticized DCU Social Expert
Schnieber-Jastram. The SCU delegate Ramsauer referred to the fact that even
leading Social Democrats would see the necessity for the rework of the
630-DM-Law. SPD politician Onur, on the other hand, defended the amendment.
According to her, it stopped the escape from Social Security. Mrs. Onur
accused the union of making the affected persons nervous. Her party
colleague Dresen as well as the alliance-green Wolf promised meanwhile
modifications of the reorganization to the containment of the currency
independence.
