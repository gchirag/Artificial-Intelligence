Increase of value-added tax
</H1>
The government clearly no longer rules out an increase of the
value-added tax. However, a spokesman for the finance ministry denied a
report in "Der Spiegel" that a raise in the value-added tax was a done
deal. But the spokesman left it open whether such an increase might
find its way into the next tax package. He said that the government
would provide tax breaks for families and entrepreneurs before the
summer break.  He added that it had not yet been decided how the
resulting decreases in revenue would be balanced out.

<P>
The FDP called for a clear statement by the government on whether
value-added taxes would be raised. Speaking in Erfurt, Mr. Westerwelle,
the General Secretary of the FDP, said that there should not be an
increase in the value-added tax during the current legislative period.

Negotiations concluded
</H1>
Labor negotiations were concluded last night in both the insurance and
steel industries when employers and unions agreed on new contracts.
Steel workers will get a 3.3% raise, and insurance employees 3.2%.

<P>
In the insurance industry, both sides agreed only after several warning
strikes and four rounds of tough negotiations.  The new contract will be
in effect for the next 12 months. Employees will get a 3.2% increase
starting April 1st, and a one-time payment of 350 DM for the first
quarter.  In addition, according to the unions, a new pension formula
was agreed to. When employees reach 57, they can opt for senior
part-time work.  Then at 60, they can withdraw from professional life,
and at 63 they can receive their pensions.  The lower pension that would
result from early retirement would be cushioned by payments from the
employers.  The beneficiaries are supposed to be trainees, to whom more
permanent jobs could be offered. In addition, trainees are to receive a
hike in their compensation: 30DM more in the first year of training,
40DM more in the second and 45DM more in the third.

<P>
The 85,000 employees in the west German iron and steel industries will
receive a one-time payment for March, April and May of 500DM.  From the
1st of June, they will receive a 3.3% increase in wage and salaries.
Their contract will last for 15 months.
