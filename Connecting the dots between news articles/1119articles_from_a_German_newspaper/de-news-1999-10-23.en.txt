Federal government running into new internal conflict
</H1>
A new clash over policy within the federal government is on the horizon.  The
Greens oppose the transportation infrastructure investment program of 60
billion marks.  The Greens' member of parliament Beringer said in an
interview with "Der Spiegel" that the program projects too little money for
expanding the rail network, and thus contradicts the Coalition Agreement.

Pensions
</H1>
Chancellor Schroeder is sticking to his policy on pensions.  According to
"Bild am Sonntag," Schroeder has rejected a compromise proposal by the Union
parties (CDU/CSU).  He maintains that for the next few years, pensions should
rise only as much as consumer prices.  This is the only way to keep payroll pension deductions at a steady level.  The Greens' parliamentary group leader
Schlauch made a similar statement.

Way out from coalition crisis over tank sales
</H1>
A new set of guidelines for German arms exports is supposed to defuse the
fallout over the delivery of a sample tank to Turkey.  Proposals to that
effect are expected on Monday for a meeting of the Coalition Council---an
institution to negotiate differences between the coalition partners---SPD
chief Struck said.  Among the suggestions are to include experts of both the
SPD and the Greens in the subcommittee in charge of export regulations.  But
the Greens want even more guarantees: They are pushing for re-introducing the
requirement of unanimity for all resolutions of the Federal Security Council,
and to more closely implement the Coalition Agreement as it concerns arms
exports.  The Greens' spokesperson for defense policy Beer said "we have a
fundamental conflict within the government."  Beer, however, ruled out
launching a signature-gathering campaign on this issue.  At most, there would
be initiatives compatible with the Coalition Agreement.  In the latter, the
SPD had consented to considering the human rights situation in the receiving
country for arms exports.  Beer has rejected blame assigned by the Defense
Ministry to Foreign Minister Fischer and the Greens for allegedly delaying
billions' worth of arms exports.  Fischer told "Berliner Tagesspiegel" that
due to the human rights situations with the Kurd conflict, nothing should be
delivered to Turkey which could be used internally.  In addition, Turkey is
in need of 16 billion marks for reconstruction after the earthquake.

Store hours
</H1>
Federal Economics Minister Mueller has come out in favor of extending store
hours on business days until 22:00.  On Sundays, however, stores must stay
closed, Mueller told "Welt am Sonntag."  Mueller would leave the current
regulation for Saturdays unchanged.  In general, all legal question marks and
opportunities for abuse should be identified and eliminated as soon as
possible, the party-less minister said.  His personal preference would be to
make the regulations flexible enough so that only family-run businesses have
an advantage from the proposed system.  The State Economics Ministers had
agreed at a meeting in Freising to submit new store hour legislation to the
chambers of Parliament before the end of the year.

Formula 1
</H1>
The Formula 1 world championship is open again.  The race for the title will
be decided in Japan on October 31.  The Appellate Court of the World
Automobile Association FIA has lifted the disqualification of Ferrari drivers
Michael Schumacher and Eddie Irvine.  They got back their points earned at
the race in Malaysia, which had been revoked because of oversized wind
deflectors on their vehicles.  The judgment says that the wind deflectors
had been within the regulations.  Thus, the decision for the Formula 1
championship will be between Eddie Irvine and McLaren-Mercedes pilot Mika
Haekkinen, at the last race of the season, a week from tomorrow in Japan.  By
total score, Irvine is four points ahead of former champion Haekkinen of
Finland.
